      "['The music of the Cameroon includes diverse traditional and modern musical genres . The best-known contemporary genre is makossa , a popular style that has gained fans across Africa , and its related dance craze bikutsi . The pirogue sailors of Douala are known for a kind of singing called ngoso which has evolved into a kind of modern music accompanied by zanza , balafon , and various percussion instruments . Traditional music The ethnicities of Cameroon include an estimated 250 distinct ethnic groups in five regional-cultural divisions . An estimated 38 % of the population are Western highlanders–Semi-Bantu or grassfielders including the Bamileke , Bamum , and many smaller Tikar groups in the northwest . 12 % are coastal tropical forest peoples , including the Bassa , Duala , and many smaller groups in the southwest . The southern tropical forest peoples ( 18 % ) include the Beti-Pahuin and their sub-groups the Bulu and Fang , the Maka and Njem , as well as , the Baka pygmies . In the semi-arid northern regions ( the Sahel ) and central highlands the Fulani ( or ; ) form an estimated 14 % of Cameroonians , while the Kirdi ( unbelievers ) are a general category , comprising 18 % of the population , of various mainly Chadic and Adamawa speakers . Beti The Beti , or Ewondo , live in the area around Yaoundé and south into Equatorial Guinea . They are best known for bikutsi music , which has been popularized and become a rival for the more urban and accessible makossa of Douala . The name can be loosely translated as beating the ground continuously . Bikutsi , characterized by an intense 6/8 rhythm , is played at Beti gatherings including parties , funerals , and weddings . Beti gatherings fall into two major categories : Ekang phase : the time when imaginary , mythological , and spiritual issues are discussed Bikutsi phase : when real-life issues are discussed A double-sided harp with calabash amplification called the mvet is used during these ceremonies by Beti storytellers , who are viewed as using the mvet as an instrument of God to educate the people . The Ekang phase is intensely musical and usually lasts all night . There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing , with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the balafon ( a type of xylophone ) . These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase which is much less strictly structured than Ekang . During bikutsi , women dance and sing along with the balafon , and lyrics focus on real-life problems , as well as sexual fantasies . These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi , and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre . Another type of ceremony is the mevungu , when women dance all night to abstain from sex during those hours for a period of nine days . The sso ritual is much-feared by Beti boys as it involves a series of tests to mark a boy \\'s passage into manhood . Modern popular music The earliest recorded popular music from Cameroon comes from the 1930s , when the most popular styles were imported pop music and French-style chanson . In Douala , the most developed city in Cameroon , accordions and ambasse bey music were common , with performers like Lobe Lobe , Ebanda Manfred , and Nelle Eyoum finding a local audience . Ekambi Brillant and the first major Cameroonian hit , \" N\\'Gon Abo , \" set the stage for the development of makossa . Post-independence in 1960 , a local variant on palm wine music called assiko , was popular especially Jean Bikoko and Dikoume Bernard . The urbanization of Cameroon has had a major influence on the country \\'s music . Migration to the city of Yaoundé , for example , was a major cause for the popularization of bikutsi music . During the 1950s , bars sprang up across the city to accommodate the influx of new inhabitants and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism . Balafon orchestras , consisting of 3-5 balafons and various percussion instruments ( including the balafon , which is both a harmonic and percussive instrument ) became common in the bars . Some of these orchestras , such as Richard Band de Zoetele , became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite . 1950s and 60s The middle of the 20th century saw the popularization of a native folk music called bikutsi . Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles and drums and xylophone . Sung by women , bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems . In a popularized form , bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s . Anne-Marie Nzié was perhaps the most important of the early innovators . The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band , Los Camaroes , who added electric guitars and other new elements . Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 1950s in Yaoundé \\'s bar scene , but the audience demanded modernity , and the popular style at the time was unable to cope . Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea , as well as Cuban , and Zairean rumba . Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper , thus giving the instrument a damper tone which emitted a \" thudding \" sound similar to the balafon . Messi \\'s style was immediately popular , and his hits , like \" Mengalla Maurice \" and \" Bekono Nga N\\'Konda , \" became radio favorites throughout the country beginning in the early 1960s . Further innovations followed , as Messi replaced the handclaps and sanza with a synthesizer and the foot-stamping 6/8 rhythm to drums . 1970s Later in the 1960s , modern makossa developed and became the most popular genre in Cameroon . Makossa is a type of funky dance music , best known outside Africa for Manu Dibango , whose 1972 single \" Soul Makossa \" was an international hit . Outside of Africa , Dibango and makossa were only briefly popular , but the genre has produced several pan-African superstars through the 1970s , 1980s and 1990s . Following Dibango , a wave of musicians electrified makossa in an attempt at making it more accessible outside of Cameroon . Another pop singer in 1970s Cameroon was André-Marie Tala , a blind singer who had a pair of hits with \" Sikati \" and \" Potaksima . \" By the 1970s , bikutsi performers like Maurice Elanga , Les Veterans , and Mbarga Soukous , added brass instruments and found controversy over pornographic lyrics . Mama Ohandja also brought bikutsi to new audiences , especially in Europe . The following decade , however , saw Les Tetes Brulées surpass previous artists in international popularity though their reaction at home was mixed . Many listeners did not like their mellow , almost easy listening-styled bikutsi . Cameroonian audiences preferred more roots-based performers like Jimmy Mvondo Mvelé and Uta Bella , both from Yaoundé . 1980s By the 1980s , makossa had moved to Paris and a new pop-makossa fused elements of Antillean zouk . Prominent musicians from this period included Moni Bilé , Douleur , Bébé Manga , , Petit-Pays , and Esa . The 1980s also saw rapid development of Cameroon \\'s media which saw a flourishing of both makossa and bikutsi . In 1980 , L\\'Equipe Nationale de Makossa was formed , joining the biggest makossa stars of the period together , including , Grace Decca , Ndedi Eyango , Ben Decca , Guy Lobe , and Dina Bell . Makossa in the 1980s saw a wave of mainstream success across Africa and , to a lesser degree , abroad as Latin influences , Martinican zouk , and pop music changed its form . While makossa enjoyed international renown , bikutsi was often denigrated as the music of savages , and it did not appeal across ethnic lines and into urban areas . Musicians continued to add innovations , however , and improved recording techniques ; Nkondo Si Tony , for example , added keyboards and synthesizers while Elanga Maurice added brass instruments . Les Veterans emerged as the most famous bikutsi group in the 1980s while other prominent performers included Titans de Sangmelima , Seba Georges , Ange Ebogo Emerent , Otheo and Mekongo President , who added complex harmonies and jazz influences . In 1984 , a new wave of bikutsi artists emerged , including Sala Bekono formerly of Los Camaroes , Atebass , a bassist , and Zanzibar , a guitarist who would eventually help form Les Têtes Brulées with Jean-Marie Ahanda . 1985 saw the formation of CRTV , a television network that did much to help popularize Cameroonian popular music across the country . Jean-Marie Ahanda became the most influential bikutsi performer of the late 1980s , and he revolutionized the genre in 1987 after forming Les Têtes Brulées , whose success changed the Cameroonian music industry . The band played an extremely popular form of bikutsi that allowed for greater depth and diversity . Guitarist Zanzibar added foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar , which made the instrument sound more like a balafon than before , and was more aggressive and innovative than previous musicians . Les Têtes Brulées emerged as a reaction against pop-makossa , which was seen as abandoning its roots in favor of mainstream success . The band \\'s image was part of its success , and they became known for their shaved heads and multi-colored body painting , done to represent traditional Beti scarification , as well as torn T-shirts that implied a common folkness in contrast to the well-styled pop-makossa performers of the period . They also wore backpacks on stage , a reference to Beti women \\'s traditional method of carrying babies while they danced bikutsi . It took only a few weeks for Les Têtes Brulées to knock makossa off the Cameroonian charts , and the band even toured France . While in France , Les Têtes Brulées recorded their first LP , Hot Heads , which was also the first bikutsi music recorded for the CD . Hot Heads expanded the lyrical format of the genre to include socio-political issues . Tours of Japan , Africa , Europe , and the United States followed , as well as Claire Denis \\' film Man No Run , which used footage from their European tour . 1990s In the 1990s , both makossa and bikutsi declined in popularity as a new wave of genres entered mainstream audiences . These included Congolese-influenced new rumba and makossa-soukous , as well as more native forms like bantowbol , northern Cameroonian nganja ( which had gained some popularity in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s ) , and an urban street music called bend-skin . Les Têtes Brulées remained the country \\'s most well known musical export , especially after accompanying the Cameroonian soccer team to the World Cup in 1990 in Italy and 1994 in the United States . A new wave of bikutsi artists arose in the early 1990s , including Les Martiens ( formed by Les Têtes Brulées bassist Atebass ) and the sexually themed roots-singer Katino Ateba ( \" Ascenseur : le secret de l\\'homme \" ) and Douala singer Sissi Dipoko ( \" Bikut-si Hit \" ) as well as a resurgence of old performers like Sala Bekono . Bikutsi \\'s international renown continued to grow , and the song \" Proof \" from Paul Simon \\'s Rhythm of the Saints , released to mainstream promotion and success in 1990 , gained yet more renown from international audiences . Vincent Nguini also contributed guitar arrangements and performance to Simon \\'s Rhythm of the Saints , which became an influential world music album , introducing many North American listeners to the wide range of instrumentation and genres . In 1993 , the Pedalé movement was born as a reaction to the Cameroonian economic slump . Youthful artists like Gibraltar Drakuss , Zele le Bombardier , Eboue Chaleur , Pasto , Roger Bekono , Mbarga Soukous , and Saint-Desiré Atango was a return to the aggressive , earthy sound of bikutsi roots . Meanwhile , Henri Dikongué , whose music incorporated , amongst others , bikutsi and makossa , began to release albums which met international success . He went on to tour Europe and North America . The most recent form of Cameroonian popular music is a fusion of Congolese soukous and makossa , a scene which has produced Petit Pays , Marcel Bwanga , Kotto Bass , Papillon and Jean Pierre Essome . Other popular genres include Bend-skin , mangambeu , and makassi .

Barcelona players have won a record twelve Ballon d\\'Or awards , with recipients including Johan Cruyff , as well as a record seven FIFA World Player of the Year awards , with winners including Romário , Ronaldo , Rivaldo and Ronaldinho . In 2010 , three players who came through the club \\'s youth academy ( Lionel Messi , Andrés Iniesta and Xavi ) were chosen as the three best players in the world in the FIFA Ballon d\\'Or awards , an unprecedented feat for players from the same football academy . Additionally , players representing the club have won a record eight European Golden Shoe awards . Barcelona is one of three founding members of the Primera División that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 , along with Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid . In 2009 , Barcelona became the first Spanish club to win the continental treble consisting of La Liga , Copa del Rey , and the UEFA Champions League , and also became the first Spanish football club to win six out of six competitions in a single year , by also winning the Spanish Super Cup , UEFA Super Cup , and FIFA Club World Cup . In 2011 , the club became European champions again , winning five trophies . This Barcelona team , which won fourteen trophies in just four years under Pep Guardiola , is considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time . By winning their fifth Champions League trophy in 2015 , Barcelona became the first European football club in history to achieve the continental treble twice . History 1899–1922 : Beginnings On 22 October 1899 , Swiss Hans Gamper placed an advertisement in Los Deportes declaring his wish to form a football club ; a positive response resulted in a meeting at the Gimnasio Solé on 29 November . Eleven players attended – Walter Wild ( the first director of the club ) , Lluís d\\'Ossó , Bartomeu Terradas , Otto Kunzle , Otto Maier , Enric Ducal , Pere Cabot , Carles Pujol , Josep Llobet , John Parsons , and William Parsons – and Foot-Ball Club Barcelona was born . FC Barcelona had a successful start in regional and national cups , competing in the Campionat de Catalunya and the Copa del Rey . In 1902 , the club won its first trophy , the Copa Macaya , and participated in the first Copa del Rey , losing 1–2 to Bizcaya in the final . In 1908 , Hans Gamper – now known as Joan Gamper – became club president in a desperate attempt to save Barcelona from extinction , finding the club struggling not just on the pitch , but also financially and socially , after not winning a competition since the Campionat de Catalunya in 1905 . He said in a meeting , \" Barcelona can not die and must not die . If there is nobody who is going to try , then I will assume the responsibility of running the club from now on . \" Club president on five separate occasions between 1908 and 1925 , he spent 25 years in total at the helm . One of his main achievements was ensuring Barça acquire its own stadium and thus generate a stable income . On 14 March 1909 , the team moved into the Camp de la Indústria , a stadium with a capacity of 8,000 . To celebrate their new surroundings , the club conducted a logo contest the following year . Carles Comamala won the contest , and his suggestion became the crest that the club still wears – with some minor changes – as of the present day . With the new stadium , Barcelona participated in the inaugural version of the Pyrenees Cup , which , at the time , consisted of the best teams of Languedoc , Midi and Aquitaine ( Southern France ) , the Basque Country and Catalonia ; all were former members of the Marca Hispanica region . The contest was the most prestigious in that era . From the inaugural year in 1910 to 1913 , Barcelona won the competition four consecutive times . Carles Comamala played an integral part of the four-time champion , managing the side along with Amechazurra and Jack Greenwell . The latter became the club \\'s first full-time coach in 1917 . The last edition was held in 1914 in the city of Barcelona , which local rivals Espanyol won . During the same period , the club changed its official language from Castilian to Catalan and gradually evolved into an important symbol of Catalan identity . For many fans , participating in the club had less to do with the game itself and more with being a part of the club \\'s collective identity . On 4 February 1917 , the club held its first testimonial match to honour Ramón Torralba , who played from 1913 to 1928 . The match was against local side Terrassa where Barcelona won the match 6–2 . Gamper simultaneously launched a campaign to recruit more club members , and by 1922 , the club had more than 20,000 , who helped finance a new stadium . The club then moved to the new Les Cortes , which they inaugurated the same year . Les Cortes had an initial capacity of 30,000 , and in the 1940s it was expanded to 60,000 . Gamper recruited Jack Greenwell as the first full-time manager in Barcelona \\'s history . After this hiring , the club \\'s fortunes began to improve on the field . During the Gamper-led era , Barcelona won eleven Campionats de Catalunya , six Copa del Rey and four Pyrenees Cups and enjoyed its first \" golden age \" . 1923–1957 : Rivera , Republic and Civil War On 14 June 1925 , in a spontaneous reaction against Primo de Rivera \\'s dictatorship , the crowd in the stadium jeered the Royal March . As a reprisal , the ground was closed for six months and Gamper was forced to relinquish the presidency of the club . This coincided with the transition to professional football , and , in 1926 , the directors of Barcelona publicly claimed , for the first time , to operate a professional football club . On 3 July 1927 , the club held a second testimonial match for Paulino Alcántara , against the Spanish national team . To kick off the match , local journalist and pilot Josep Canudas dropped the ball onto the pitch from his aeroplane . In 1928 , victory in the Spanish Cup was celebrated with a poem titled \" Oda a Platko \" , which was written by a member of the Generation of \\'27 , Rafael Alberti , inspired by the heroic performance of the Barcelona goalkeeper , Franz Platko . On 23 June 1929 , Barcelona won the inaugural Spanish League . A year after winning the championship , on 30 July 1930 , Gamper committed suicide after a period of depression brought on by personal and financial problems . Although they continued to have players of the standing of Josep Escolà , the club now entered a period of decline , in which political conflict overshadowed sports throughout society . Attendance at matches dropped as the citizens of Barcelona were occupied with discussing political matters . Although the team won the Campionat de Catalunya in 1930 , 1931 , 1932 , 1934 , 1936 and 1938 , success at a national level ( with the exception of the 1937 disputed title ) evaded them . A month after the Spanish Civil War began in 1936 , several players from Barcelona enlisted in the ranks of those who fought against the military uprising , along with players from Athletic Bilbao . On 6 August , Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol , a representative of the pro-independence political party . He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme , and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity . In the summer of 1937 , the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States , where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic . The tour led to the financial security of the club , but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France , making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies . On 16 March 1938 , Barcelona came under aerial bombardment from the Italian Air Force , causing more than 3,000 deaths , with one of the bombs hitting the club \\'s offices . A few months later , Catalonia came under occupation and as a symbol of the \" undisciplined \" Catalanism , the club , now down to just 3,486 members , faced a number of restrictions . All signs of regional nationalism , including language , flag and other signs of separatism were banned throughout Spain . The Catalan flag was banned and the club were prohibited from using non-Spanish names . These measures forced the club to change its name to Club de Fútbol Barcelona and to remove the Catalan flag from its crest . In 1943 , Barcelona faced rivals Real Madrid in the semi-finals of Copa del Generalísimo ( now the Copa del Rey ) . The first match at Les Corts was won by Barcelona 3–0 . Real Madrid comfortably won the second leg , beating Barcelona 11–1 . According to football writer Sid Lowe , \" There have been relatively few mentions of the game [ since ] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid . Indeed , the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona \\'s history . This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims . \" It has been alleged by local journalist Paco Aguilar that Barcelona \\'s players were threatened by police in the changing room , though nothing was ever proven . Despite the difficult political situation , CF Barcelona enjoyed considerable success during the 1940s and 1950s . In 1945 , with Josep Samitier as coach and players like César , Ramallets and Velasco , they won La Liga for the first time since 1929 . They added two more titles in 1948 and 1949 . In 1949 , they also won the first Copa Latina . In June 1950 , Barcelona signed László Kubala , who was to be an important figure at the club . On a rainy Sunday of 1951 , the crowd left Les Corts stadium after a 2–1 win against Santander by foot , refusing to catch any trams , and surprising the Francoist authorities . The reason was simple : at the same time , a tram strike was taking place in Barcelona , receiving the support of blaugrana fans . Events like this made CF Barcelona represent much more than just Catalonia and many progressive Spaniards saw the club as a staunch defender of rights and freedoms . Coach Ferdinand Daučík and László Kubala led the team to five different trophies including La Liga , the Copa del Generalísimo , the Copa Latina , the Copa Eva Duarte , and the Copa Martini Rossi in 1952 . In 1953 , the club won La Liga and the Copa del Generalísimo again . 1957–1978 : Club de Fútbol Barcelona With Helenio Herrera as coach , a young Luis Suárez , the European Footballer of the Year in 1960 , and two influential Hungarians recommended by Kubala , Sándor Kocsis and Zoltán Czibor , the team won another national double in 1959 and a La Liga and Fairs Cup double in 1960 . In 1961 , they became the first club to beat Real Madrid in a European Cup play-off . However , they lost 2–3 to Benfica in the final . The 1960s were less successful for the club , with Real Madrid monopolising La Liga . The completion of the Camp Nou , finished in 1957 , meant the club had little money to spend on new players . The 1960s saw the emergence of Josep Maria Fusté and Carles Rexach , and the club won the Copa del Generalísimo in 1963 and the Fairs Cup in 1966 . Barcelona restored some pride by beating Real Madrid 1–0 in the 1968 Copa del Generalísimo final at the Santiago Bernabéu in front of Francisco Franco , with coach Salvador Artigas , a former republican pilot in the Civil War . With the end of Franco \\'s dictatorship in 1974 , the club changed its official name back to Futbol Club Barcelona and reverted the crest to its original design , including the original letters once again . The 1973–74 season saw the arrival of Johan Cruyff , who was bought for a world record £920,000 from Ajax . Already an established player with Ajax , Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco . He further endeared himself when he named his son \" Jordi \" , after the local Catalan Saint George . Next to champions like Juan Manuel Asensi , Carles Rexach and Hugo Sotil , he helped the club win the 1973–74 season for the first time since 1960 , defeating Real Madrid 5–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu en route . He was crowned European Footballer of the Year in 1973 during his first season with Barcelona ( his second Ballon d\\'Or win ; he won his first while playing for Ajax in 1971 ) . Cruyff received this prestigious award a third time ( the first player to do so ) in 1974 , while he was still with Barcelona . 1978–2000 : Núñez and stabilization In 1978 , Josep Lluís Núñez became the first elected president of FC Barcelona , and , since then , the members of Barcelona have elected the club president . The process of electing a president of FC Barcelona was closely tied to Spain \\'s transition to democracy in 1974 and the end of Franco \\'s dictatorship . The new president \\'s main objective was to develop Barcelona into a world-class club by giving it stability both on and off the pitch . His presidency was to last for 22 years , and it deeply affected the image of Barcelona , as Núñez held to a strict policy regarding wages and discipline , letting go of such players as Diego Maradona , Romário and Ronaldo rather than meeting their demands . On 16 May 1979 , the club won its first European Cup Winners \\' Cup by beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 4–3 in Basel in a final watched by more than 30,000 travelling blaugrana fans . The same year , Núñez began to invest in the club \\'s youth programme by converting La Masia into a dormitory for young academy players from abroad . The name of the dormitory would later become synonymous with the youth programme of Barcelona . In June 1982 , Diego Maradona was signed for a world record fee of £5 million from Boca Juniors . In the following season , under coach César Luis Menotti , Barcelona won the Copa del Rey , beating Real Madrid . Maradona \\'s time with Barcelona , however , was short-lived and he soon left for Napoli . At the start of the 1984–85 season , Terry Venables was hired as manager and he won La Liga with noteworthy displays by German midfielder Bernd Schuster . The next season , he took the team to their second European Cup final , only to lose on penalties to Steaua București during a dramatic evening in Seville . Around this time , tensions began to arise between what was perceived as president Núñez \\'s dictatorial rule and the nationalistic support group , Boixos Nois . The group , identified with a left-wing separatism , repeatedly demanded the resignation of Núñez and openly defied him through chants and banners at matches . At the same time , Barcelona experienced an eruption in skinheads , who often identified with a right-wing separatism . The skinheads slowly transferred the Boixos Nois \\' ideology from liberalism to fascism , which caused division within the group and a sudden support for Núñez \\'s presidency . Inspired by British hooligans , the remaining Boixos Nois became violent , causing havoc leading to large-scale arrests . After the 1986 FIFA World Cup , Barcelona signed the English top scorer Gary Lineker , along with goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta , but the team could not achieve success , as Schuster was excluded from the team . Terry Venables was subsequently fired at the beginning of the 1987–88 season and replaced with Luis Aragonés . The season finished with the players rebelling against president Núñez , in an event known as the Hesperia mutiny , and a 1–0 victory in the Copa del Rey final against Real Sociedad . The Dream Team era In 1988 , Johan Cruyff returned to the club , this time as manager and he assembled what would later be dubbed the \" Dream Team \" . He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola , José Mari Bakero , Jon Andoni Goikoetxea , Miguel Angel Nadal and Txiki Begiristain while signing international players such as Ronald Koeman , Michael Laudrup , Romário and Hristo Stoichkov . It was ten years after the inception of the youth programme , La Masia , when the young players began to graduate and play for their first team . One of the first graduates , who would later earn international acclaim , was future Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola . Under Cruyff \\'s guidance , Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994 . They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley , with a free kick goal from Dutch international Ronald Koeman . They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990 , the European Super Cup in 1992 and three Supercopa de España trophies . With 11 trophies , Cruyff became the club \\'s most successful manager at that point . He also became the club \\'s longest consecutive serving manager , serving eight years . Cruyff \\'s fortune was to change , and , in his final two seasons , he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president Josep Lluís Núñez , resulting in his departure . On the legacy of Cruyff \\'s football philosophy and the passing style of play he introduced to the club , future coach of Barcelona Pep Guardiola would state , \" Cruyff built the cathedral , our job is to maintain and renovate it . \" Reacting to Cruyff \\'s departure , an independent protest group was organised by Armand Caraben , Joan Laporta and Alfons Godall . The objective of the group , called L\\'Elefant Blau , was to oppose the presidency of Núñez , which they regarded as a corruption of the club \\'s traditional values . Laporta would later take over the presidency of Barcelona in 2003 . Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson , who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996–97 . He recruited Ronaldo for a world record transfer fee from his previous club , PSV and delivered a cup treble , winning the Copa del Rey , UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup and the Supercopa de España , with Ronaldo registering 47 goals in 49 games . Despite his success , Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available . Like Maradona , Ronaldo only stayed a short time before he left for Inter Milan in another world record transfer . However , new heroes emerged , such as Luís Figo , Patrick Kluivert , Luis Enrique and Rivaldo , and the team won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998 . In 1999 , the club celebrated its centenari , winning the Primera División title , and Rivaldo became the fourth Barcelona player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year . Despite this domestic success , the failure to emulate Real Madrid in the Champions League led to van Gaal and Núñez resigning in 2000 . 2000–2008 : Exit Núñez , enter Laporta The departures of Núñez and Van Gaal were hardly noticed by the fans when compared to that of Luís Figo , then club vice-captain . Figo had become a cult hero and was considered by Catalans to be one of their own . Barcelona fans , however , were distraught by Figo \\'s decision to join arch-rivals Real Madrid , and , during subsequent visits to the Camp Nou , Figo was given an extremely hostile reception . Upon his first return , a piglet \\'s head and a full bottle of whiskey were thrown at him from the crowd . The next three years saw the club in decline , and managers came and went . Van Gaal was replaced by Lorenzo Serra Ferrer who , despite an extensive investment in players in the summer of 2000 , presided over a mediocre league campaign and a first-round Champions League exit , and was dismissed late in the season . Long-serving Barcelona deputy coach Carles Rexach was appointed as his replacement , initially on a temporary basis , and managed to at least steer the club to the last Champions League spot on the final day of the season against Valencia via an exceptional performance from Rivaldo , who completed arguably the greatest hat-trick in history with an overhead bicycle kick winner in the final minute to secure qualification . Despite better form in La Liga and a good run to the semi-finals of the Champions League , Rexach was never viewed as a long-term solution and that summer Van Gaal returned to the club for a second spell as manager . What followed , despite another decent Champions League performance , was one of the worst La Liga campaigns in the club \\'s history , with the team as low as 15th in February 2003 . This led to Van Gaal \\'s resignation and replacement for the rest of the campaign by Radomir Antić , though a sixth-place finish was the best that he could manage . At the end of the season , Antić \\'s short-term contract was not renewed , and club president Joan Gaspart resigned , his position having been made completely untenable by such a disastrous season on top of the club \\'s overall decline in fortunes since he became president three years prior . After the disappointment of the Gaspart era , the combination of a new young president , Joan Laporta , and a young new manager , former Dutch and Milan star Frank Rijkaard , saw the club bounce back . On the field , an influx of international players , including Ronaldinho , Deco , Henrik Larsson , Ludovic Giuly , Samuel Eto \\' o , Rafael Márquez and Edgar Davids , combined with home grown Spanish players , such as Carles Puyol , Andrés Iniesta , Xavi and Víctor Valdés , led to the club \\'s return to success . Barcelona won La Liga and the Supercopa de España in 2004–05 , and Ronaldinho and Eto \\' o were voted first and third , respectively , in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards . In the 2005–06 season , Barcelona repeated their league and Supercopa successes . The pinnacle of the league season arrived at the Santiago Bernabéu in a 3–0 win over Real Madrid . It was Rijkaard \\'s second victory at the Bernabéu , making him the first Barcelona manager to win there twice . Ronaldinho \\'s performance was so impressive that after his second goal , which was Barcelona \\'s third , some Real Madrid fans gave him a standing ovation . In the Champions League , Barcelona beat the English club Arsenal in the final . Trailing 1–0 to a ten-man Arsenal and with less than 15 minutes remaining , they came back to win 2–1 , with substitute Henrik Larsson , in his final appearance for the club , setting up goals for Samuel Eto \\' o and fellow substitute Juliano Belletti , for the club \\'s first European Cup victory in 14 years . Despite being the favourites and starting strongly , Barcelona finished the 2006–07 season without trophies . A pre-season US tour was later blamed for a string of injuries to key players , including leading scorer Eto \\' o and rising star Lionel Messi . There was open feuding as Eto \\' o publicly criticised coach Rijkaard and Ronaldinho . Ronaldinho also admitted that a lack of fitness affected his form . In La Liga , Barcelona were in first place for much of the season , but inconsistency in the New Year saw Real Madrid overtake them to become champions . Barcelona advanced to the semi-finals of the Copa del Rey , winning the first leg against Getafe 5–2 , with a goal from Messi bringing comparison to Diego Maradona \\'s goal of the century , but then lost the second leg 4–0 . They took part in the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup , but were beaten by a late goal in the final against Brazilian side Internacional . In the Champions League , Barcelona were knocked out of the competition in the last 16 by eventual runners-up Liverpool on away goals . Barcelona finished the 2007–08 season third in La Liga and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League and Copa del Rey , both times losing to the eventual champions , Manchester United and Valencia , respectively . The day after a 4–1 defeat to Real Madrid , Joan Laporta announced that Barcelona B coach Pep Guardiola would take over Frank Rijkaard \\'s duties on 30 June 2008 . 2008–2012 : Guardiola era Barcelona B youth manager Pep Guardiola took over Frank Rijkaard \\'s duties at the conclusion of the season . Barça beat Athletic Bilbao 4–1 in the 2009 Copa del Rey Final , winning the competition for a record-breaking 25th time . A historic 2–6 victory against Real Madrid followed three days later and ensured that Barcelona became 2008–09 La Liga champions . Barça finished the season by beating Manchester United 2–0 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome , with goals from Eto \\' o and Messi , to win their third Champions League title , and complete the first ever treble won by a Spanish team . The team went on to win the 2009 Supercopa de España against Athletic Bilbao and the 2009 UEFA Super Cup against Shakhtar Donetsk , becoming the first European club to win both domestic and European Super Cups following a treble . In December 2009 , Barcelona won the 2009 Club World Cup . Barcelona accomplished two new records in Spanish football in 2010 as they retained the La Liga trophy with 99 points and won the Supercopa de España for a ninth time . After Laporta \\'s departure from the club in June 2010 , Sandro Rosell was soon elected as the new president . The elections were held on 13 June , where he got 61.35 % ( 57,088 votes , a record ) of total votes . Rosell signed David Villa from Valencia for €40 million and Javier Mascherano from Liverpool for €19 million . At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa , Barcelona players that had graduated from the club \\'s La Masia youth system would play a major role in Spain becoming world champions . On 11 July , seven players who came through the academy participated in the final , six of which were Barcelona players whom started the match , with Iniesta scoring the winning goal against the Netherlands . In November 2010 , Barcelona defeated their main rival Real Madrid 5–0 in El Clásico . At the ceremony for the 2010 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or in December , Barcelona \\'s La Masia became the first youth academy ever to have all three finalists for the Ballon d\\'Or , with Messi , Iniesta and Xavi being named the three best players in the world for 2010 . In the 2010–11 season , Barcelona retained the La Liga trophy , their third title in succession , finishing with 96 points . In April 2011 , the club reached the Copa del Rey final , losing 1–0 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia . In May , Barcelona defeated Manchester United in the 2011 Champions League Final 3–1 held at Wembley Stadium , a repeat of the 2009 final , winning their fourth European Cup . In August 2011 , La Masia graduate Cesc Fàbregas was bought from Arsenal and he would help Barcelona defend the Spanish Supercup against Real Madrid . The Supercup victory brought the total number of official trophies to 73 , matching the number of titles won by Real Madrid . Later the same month , Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup defeating Porto 2–0 with goals from Messi and Fàbregas . This extended the club \\'s overall number of official trophies to 74 , surpassing Real Madrid \\'s total amount of official trophies . The Super Cup victory also saw Guardiola win his 12th trophy out of a possible 15 in his three years at the helm of the club , becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona . In December , Barcelona won the Club World Cup for a record second time since its establishment , after defeating 2011 Copa Libertadores holders Santos 4–0 in the final thanks to two goals from Messi and goals from Xavi and Fàbregas . As a result , the overall trophy haul during the reign of Guardiola was further extended and saw Barcelona win their 13th trophy out of a possible 16 . Considered by some in the sport to be the greatest team of all time , with Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson stating , ” They mesmerise you with their passing ” , their five trophies in 2011 saw them receive the Laureus World Sports Award for Team of the Year . In the 2011–12 season , Barcelona lost the semi-finals of the Champions League against Chelsea . Guardiola , who had been on a rolling contract and had faced criticism over his recent tactics and squad selections , announced that he would step down as manager on 30 June and be succeeded by assistant Tito Vilanova . Guardiola finished his tenure with Barça winning the Copa del Rey final 3–0 , bringing the tally to 14 trophies that Barça had won under his coaching . It was announced in summer of 2012 that Tito Vilanova , assistant manager at Barcelona , would take over from Pep Guardiola as manager . Following his appointment , Barcelona went on an incredible run that saw them hold the top spot on the league table for the entire season , recording only two losses and amassing 100 points . Their top scorer once again was Lionel Messi , who scored 46 goals in La Liga , including two hat-tricks . On 11 May 2013 , Barcelona were crowned as the Spanish football champions for the 22nd time , still with four games left to play . Ultimately , Barcelona ended the season 15 points clear of rivals Real Madrid , despite losing 2–1 to them at the beginning of March . They reached the semi-final stage of both the Copa del Rey and the Champions League , going out to Real Madrid and Bayern Munich respectively . On 19 July , it was announced that Vilanova was resigning as Barcelona manager because his throat cancer had returned , and he would be receiving treatment for the second time after a three-month medical leave in December 2012 . 2014–2020 : Bartomeu era On 22 July 2013 , Gerardo \" Tata \" Martino was confirmed as manager of Barcelona for the 2013–14 season . Barcelona won the 2013 Supercopa de España 1–1 on away goals . On 23 January 2014 , Sandro Rosell resigned as president by the admissibility of a complaint for alleged misappropriation following the transfer of Neymar . Josep Maria Bartomeu replaced him to finish the term . Barcelona won the treble in the 2014–15 season , winning La Liga , Copa del Rey and Champions League titles , and became the first European team to have won the treble twice . On 17 May , the club clinched their 23rd La Liga title after defeating Atlético Madrid . This was Barcelona \\'s seventh La Liga title in the last ten years . On 30 May , the club defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final at Camp Nou . On 6 June , Barcelona won the 2015 Champions League Final with a 3–1 win against Juventus , which completed the treble , the club \\'s second in six years . Barcelona \\'s attacking trio of Messi , Suárez and Neymar , dubbed \" MSN \" , scored 122 goals in all competitions , the most in a season for an attacking trio in Spanish football history . On 11 August , Barcelona started the 2015–16 season winning a joint record fifth European Super Cup by beating Sevilla 5–4 in the 2015 UEFA Super Cup . They ended the year with a 3–0 win over Argentine club River Plate in the 2015 Club World Cup final on 20 December to win the trophy for a record third time , with Suárez , Messi and Iniesta the top three players of the tournament . The Club World Cup was Barcelona \\'s 20th international title , a record only matched by Egyptian club Al Ahly . By scoring 180 goals in 2015 in all competitions , Barcelona set the record for most goals scored in a calendar year , breaking Real Madrid \\'s record of 178 goals scored in 2014 . On 10 February 2016 , qualifying for the sixth Copa del Rey final in the last eight seasons , Luis Enrique \\'s Barcelona broke the club \\'s record of 28 consecutive games unbeaten in all competitions set by Guardiola \\'s team in the 2010–11 season , with a 1–1 draw with Valencia in the second leg of the 2015–16 Copa del Rey . With a 5–1 win at Rayo Vallecano on 3 March , Barcelona \\'s 35th match unbeaten , the club broke Real Madrid \\'s Spanish record of 34 games unbeaten in all competitions from the 1988–1989 season . After Barça reached 39 matches unbeaten , their run ended on 2 April 2016 with a 2–1 defeat to Real Madrid at Camp Nou . On 14 May 2016 , Barcelona won their sixth La Liga title in eight seasons . The front three of Messi , Suárez and Neymar finished the season with 131 goals , breaking the record they had set the previous year for most goals by an attacking trio in a single season . On 8 March 2017 , Barcelona made the largest comeback in Champions League history in the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League Round of 16 second Leg , defeating Paris Saint-Germain 6–1 ( aggregate score 6–5 ) , despite losing the first leg in France by a score of 4–0 . On 29 May 2017 , former player Ernesto Valverde was named as Luis Enrique \\'s successor . On 20 September 2017 , Barcelona issued a statement exercising their stance on the 2017 Catalan referendum saying , \" FC Barcelona , in holding the utmost respect for its diverse body of members , will continue to support the will of the majority of Catalan people , and will do so in a civil , peaceful , and exemplary way \" . The match against UD Las Palmas on the referendum day was requested to be postponed by the Barcelona board due to heavy violence in Catalonia , but it ( the request ) was declined by La Liga , therefore being held behind closed doors . Two directors , Jordi Monés and Carles Vilarrubí , handed in their resignations in protest at the game \\'s being played . Winning La Liga for the 2017–18 season , on 9 May 2018 , Barcelona defeated Villarreal 5–1 to set the longest unbeaten streak ( 43 games ) in La Liga history . On 27 April 2019 , Barcelona won their 26th La Liga title . However , the La Liga title was overshadowed by an improbable Champions League exit to Liverpool in the semi-finals , with Barça losing the second leg 0–4 after being up 3–0 after a home victory . On 13 January 2020 , following the loss to Atlético Madrid in the Spanish Supercup , former Real Betis coach Quique Setién replaced Ernesto Valverde as the new head coach of Barcelona . Ultimately Barcelona finished the season trophyless for first time in 12 years . On 17 August , the club confirmed that Setién had been removed from his position as manager with director of football Eric Abidal also dismissed from his position . Two days later , Ronald Koeman was appointed as the new head coach of Barcelona . Rising dissatisfaction among supporters due to worsening finances and decline on the pitch in the previous season led to Josep Maria Bartomeu announcing his resignation as president on 27 October 2020 , to avoid facing a vote of no confidence from the club members . 2021–present : Return of Laporta and departure of Messi On 7 March 2021 , Joan Laporta was elected president of Barcelona with 54.28 % of the vote . Barcelona won their 31st Copa del Rey , their first trophy under Ronald Koeman , after defeating Athletic Bilbao 4–0 in the final . On 5 August 2021 , despite Barcelona and Messi having reached an agreement and the clear intention of both parties to sign a new contract , the deal could not happen due to financial and structural obstacles posed by the Spanish Liga regulations . On 10 August it was announced that Messi had joined French Ligue 1 side Paris Saint-Germain as a free agent , ending his 21-year spell with Barcelona . Koeman was sacked as manager on 28 October 2021 , and on 6 November Xavi was announced as the club ’ s new manager , with a contract until 2024 . On 8 December , Barcelona dropped to the Europa League for first time in 17 years , as they finished third in the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League group stage . Support The nickname culer for a Barcelona supporter is derived from the Catalan cul ( English : arse ) , as the spectators at the first stadium , Camp de la Indústria , sat with their culs over the stand . In Spain , about 25 % of the population is said to be Barça sympathisers , second behind Real Madrid , supported by 32 % of the population . Throughout Europe , Barcelona is the favourite second-choice club . The club \\'s membership figures have seen a significant increase from 100,000 in the 2003–04 season to 170,000 in September 2009 , the sharp rise being attributed to the influence of Ronaldinho and then-president Joan Laporta \\'s media strategy that focused on Spanish and English online media . In addition to membership , there are 1,259 officially registered fan clubs , called penyes , around the world . The fan clubs promote Barcelona in their locality and receive beneficial offers when visiting Barcelona . Among the best supported teams globally , Barcelona has the second highest social media following in the world among sports teams , with over 103 million Facebook fans , only behind Real Madrid with 111 million . The club has had many prominent people among its supporters , including Pope John Paul II , who was an honorary member , and former prime minister of Spain José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero . Club rivalries El Clásico There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league , and this is particularly the case in La Liga , where the game between Barcelona and Real Madrid is known as \" The Classic \" ( El Clásico ) . From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain : Catalonia and Castile , as well as of the two cities . The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians , seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War . Over the years , the head-to-head record between the two clubs is 99 victories for Madrid , 96 victories for Barcelona , and 52 draws . During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera ( 1923–1930 ) and especially of Francisco Franco ( 1939–1975 ) , all regional cultures were suppressed . All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory , except Spanish ( Castilian ) itself , were officially banned . Symbolising the Catalan people \\'s desire for freedom , Barça became \\'More than a club \\' ( Més que un club ) for the Catalans . According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán , the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça . It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement , and allowed them to express their dissidence . During Franco \\'s regime , however , the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level , even giving two awards to him . On the other hand , Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond : Santiago Bernabéu , the former club president for whom their stadium is named , fought on the Nationalist side during the Spanish Civil War . During the Spanish Civil War , however , members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael Sánchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters . During the 1950s , the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano , who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success . The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice in a controversial knock-out round of the European Cup , with Madrid receiving unfavourable treatment from the referee . In 2002 , the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \" Match of The Century \" by Spanish media , and Madrid \\'s win was watched by more than 500 million people . An intense fixture which is marked by its indiscipline in addition to memorable goal celebrations from both teams – often involving mocking the opposition – such notable celebrations occurred in 2009 when Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of incensed Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and in 2017 when Lionel Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them . El derbi Barceloní Barça \\'s local rival has always been Espanyol . Blanc-i-blaus , being one of the clubs granted royal patronage , was founded exclusively by Spanish football fans , unlike the multinational nature of Barça \\'s primary board . The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona , and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners . The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid . Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià . Traditionally , Espanyol was seen by the vast majority of Barcelona \\'s citizens as a club which cultivated a kind of compliance to the central authority , in stark contrast to Barça \\'s revolutionary spirit . Also in the 1960s and 1970s , while FC Barcelona acted as an integrating force for Catalonia \\'s new arrivals from poorer regions of Spain expecting to find a better life , Espanyol drew their support mainly from sectors close to the regime such as policemen , military officers , civil servants and career fascists . In 1918 , Espanyol started a counter-petition against autonomy , which at that time had become a pertinent issue . Later on , an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War , siding with the fascists . Despite these differences in ideology , the derbi has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives . In recent years the rivalry has become less political , as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan . Though it is the most played local derby in the history of La Liga , it is also the most unbalanced , with Barcelona overwhelmingly dominant . In the primera división league table , Espanyol has only managed to end above Barça on three occasions from 86 seasons ( 1928–2021 ) and the only all-Catalan Copa del Rey final was won by Barça in 1957 . Espanyol has the consolation of achieving the largest margin win with a 6–0 in 1951 , while Barcelona \\'s biggest win was 5–0 on seven occasions ( in 1933 , 1947 , 1964 , 1975 , 1992 , 2016 and 2017 ) . Espanyol achieved a 2–1 win against Barça during the 2008–09 season , becoming the first team to defeat Barcelona at Camp Nou in their treble-winning season . Rivalry with A.C . Milan Barcelona \\'s rival in European football is Italian club A.C . Milan . The team against which Barcelona has played the most matches ( 19 ) , it is also the second most played match in European competitions , tied with Real Madrid–Juventus and both after Real Madrid–Bayern Munich ( 24 ) . Two of the most successful clubs in Europe , Milan has won seven European Cups to Barça \\'s five , while both clubs have won a record five European Super Cups . Barcelona and Milan have won other continental titles , which make them the second and third most decorated teams in world football , with 20 and 18 titles respectively , both behind Real Madrid \\'s 26 . Barcelona leads the head-to-head record with eight wins and five defeats . The first encounter between the two clubs was in the 1959–60 European Cup . They faced off in the round of 16 and Barça won the tie on a 7–1 aggregate score ( 0–2 in Milan and 5–1 in Barcelona ) . While Milan had never knocked Barcelona out of the European Cup , they beat Johan Cruyff \\'s Dream Team 4–0 in the 1994 Champions League final , despite being the underdogs . In 2013 , however , Barcelona made a \" historic \" comeback from a 0–2 first leg defeat in the round of 16 of the 2012–13 Champions League , winning 4–0 at the Camp Nou . Ownership and finances [ [ File : Civil Guards Socis Camp Industria.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Civil Guards at the socis \" \\' entrance of the Camp de la Indústria ] ] Along with Real Madrid , Athletic Bilbao , and Osasuna , Barcelona is organised as a registered association .

The members of Barcelona , called socis , form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club . , the club has 144,000 socis . In 2010 , Forbes evaluated Barcelona \\'s worth to be around €752 million ( US $ 1 billion ) , ranking them fourth after Manchester United , Real Madrid and Arsenal , based on figures from the 2008–09 season . According to Deloitte , Barcelona had a recorded revenue of €366 million in the same period , ranking second to Real Madrid , who generated €401 million in revenue . In 2013 , Forbes magazine ranked Barcelona the third most valuable sports team in the world , behind Real Madrid and Manchester United , with a value of $ 2.6 billion . In 2014 , Forbes ranked them the second most valuable sports team in the world , worth $ 3.2 billion , and Deloitte ranked them the world \\'s fourth richest football club in terms of revenue , with an annual turnover of €484.6 million . In 2017 , Forbes ranked them the fourth most valuable sports team in the world with a team value of $ 3.64 billion . In 2018 , Barcelona became the first sports team to surpass $ 1bn in annual revenues . In November 2018 Barcelona became the first sports team with average first-team pay in excess of £10m ( $ 13.8m ) per year . However , years of profligate spending under the reign of Josep Maria Bartomeu ( president between 2014 and 2020 ) , such as on failed transfers , and other factors such as the COVID pandemic , saw the club ’ s gross debt rise to about $ 1.4bn in 2021 , much of it short-term . Records In March 2021 , Lionel Messi overtook Xavi \\'s record of 767 games played for the club , and presently has made 778 official appearances in all competitions , while also holding the record for the most appearances in La Liga matches for Barcelona , with 520 . Barcelona \\'s all-time highest goalscorer in official competitions is Lionel Messi with 672 goals , surpassing Paulino Alcántara \\'s 369 goals in March 2014 , a record which stood for 87 years . In December 2020 , Messi also overtook Pelé ’ s 643 goals for Santos to become the highest official scorer for a single club . László Kubala holds the La Liga record for most goals scored in one match , with seven goals against Sporting Gijón in 1952 . Lionel Messi co-holds the Champions League record with five goals against Bayer Leverkusen in 2012 . Eulogio Martínez became Barça \\'s top goalscorer in a cup game , when he scored seven goals against Atlético Madrid in 1957 . Barcelona goalkeepers have won a record number of Zamora trophies ( 20 ) , with Antoni Ramallets and Víctor Valdés winning a record five each . Valdés had a ratio of 0.832 goals-conceded-per-game , a La Liga record , and he also holds the record for longest period without conceding a goal ( 896 minutes ) in all competitions for Barcelona . Claudio Bravo has the record of best unbeaten start in a season in La Liga history , at 754 minutes . Barcelona \\'s longest serving manager is Jack Greenwell , with nine years in two spells ( 1917–1924 ) and ( 1931–1933 ) , and Pep Guardiola is the club \\'s most successful manager ( 14 trophies in 4 years ) . The most successful Barcelona player is Lionel Messi with 35 trophies , surpassing Andrés Iniesta , with 32 trophies . Barcelona \\'s Camp Nou is the largest stadium in Europe . The club \\'s highest home attendance was 120,000 in a European Cup quarter-final against Juventus on 3 March 1986 . The modernisation of Camp Nou during the 1990s and the introduction of all-seater stands means the record will not be broken for the foreseeable future as the current capacity of the stadium is 99,354.El Barça de les Cinc Copes is the first team in Spanish football to have won five trophies in a single season ( 1951–1952 ) . Barcelona is the only club to have played in every season of European competitions since they started in 1955 counting non-UEFA competition Inter-Cities Fairs Cup . On 18 December 2009 , alongside being the only Spanish club to achieve a continental treble , Barcelona became the first ever European football team to win six trophies in a calendar year ( a sextuple ) . In January 2018 , Barcelona signed Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool for €120 million , the highest transfer fee in club \\'s history . In August 2017 , Barcelona player Neymar transferred to Paris Saint-Germain for a world record transfer fee of €222 million . In 2016 , Barcelona \\'s La Masia was ranked second by the International Centre for Sports Studies ( CIES ) as the most top-level players producing academy in the world . Kits and crest The club \\'s original crest was a quartered diamond-shaped crest topped by the Crown of Aragon and the bat of King James , and surrounded by two branches , one of a laurel tree and the other a palm . The club shared Barcelona \\'s coat of arms , as a demonstration of its identification with the city and a desire to be recognised as one . In 1910 , the club held a competition among its members to design a new crest . The winner was Carles Comamala , who at the time played for the club . Comamala \\'s suggestion became the crest that the club wears today , with some minor variations . The crest consists of the St George Cross in the upper-left corner with the Catalan flag beside it , and the team colours at the bottom . The blue and red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900 . Several competing theories have been put forth for the blue and red design of the Barcelona shirt . The son of the first president , Arthur Witty , claimed it was the idea of his father as the colours were the same as the Merchant Taylor \\'s School team . Another explanation , according to author Toni Strubell , is that the colours are from Robespierre \\'s First Republic . In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team , FC Basel . Since 1998 , the club has had a kit deal with Nike . In 2016 , the deal was renewed until 2028 , for a record €155 million per year but the contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime if Barcelona fail to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga . Kit suppliers and shirt sponsors Stadium Barcelona initially played in the Camp de la Indústria . The capacity was about 6,000 , and club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club with growing membership . In 1922 , the number of supporters had surpassed 20,000 and by lending money to the club , Barça was able to build the larger Camp de Les Corts , which had an initial capacity of 20,000 spectators . After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and a larger number of spectators at matches . This led to several expansion projects : the grandstand in 1944 , the southern stand in 1946 , and finally the northern stand in 1950 . After the last expansion , Les Corts could hold 60,000 spectators . After the construction was complete there was no further room for expansion at Les Corts . Back-to-back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 and the signing of László Kubala in June 1950 , who would later go on to score 196 goals in 256 matches , drew larger crowds to the games.Farred , Grant . p . 124 . The club began to make plans for a new stadium . The building of Camp Nou commenced on 28 March 1954 , before a crowd of 60,000 Barça fans . The first stone of the future stadium was laid in place under the auspices of Governor Felipe Acedo Colunga and with the blessing of Archbishop of Barcelona Gregorio Modrego . Construction took three years and ended on 24 September 1957 with a final cost of 288 million pesetas , 336 % over budget . In 1980 , when the stadium was in need of redesign to meet UEFA criteria , the club raised money by offering supporters the opportunity to inscribe their name on the bricks for a small fee . The idea was popular with supporters , and thousands of people paid the fee . Later this became the centre of controversy when media in Madrid picked up reports that one of the stones was inscribed with the name of long-time Real Madrid chairman and Franco supporter Santiago Bernabéu.Ball , Phil pp . 121–22 . In preparation for the 1992 Summer Olympics two tiers of seating were installed above the previous roofline . It has a current capacity of 99,354 making it the largest stadium in Europe . In December 2021 , a record 88 % of the club members voted in favor of the Espai Barça \" project to revamp the club ’ s sporting facilities , being the first online referendum in FC Barcelona history . Originally projected to have been completed in 2021 , it is now aimed to finish by the end of 2025 , with an estimated €1.5 billion net funding . There are also other facilities , which include : Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper ( FC Barcelona \\'s training ground ) Masia-Centre de Formació Oriol Tort ( Residence of young players ) Estadi Johan Cruyff ( Home of the reserve team and women \\'s team ) Palau Blaugrana ( FC Barcelona indoor sports arena ) Palau Blaugrana 2 ( Secondary indoor arena of FC Barcelona ) Palau de Gel ( FC Barcelona ice rink ) Honours Shared record In 2015 , Barcelona received the Nine Values Cup , an award of the international children \\'s social programme Football for Friendship .

Argentina is known for having rivalries with Brazil , Uruguay , England , and Germany due to particular occurrences with one another throughout football history . History The first match ever recorded for Argentina was against Uruguay , on 20 June 1902 . The game ( which was the first international for both sides ) was held in Montevideo and Argentina won 6–0 . During the first years of its existence , the Argentina national team only played friendly matches against other South American teams . The reasons for this varied , including long travel times between countries and the interruption of World War I . La Selección ( national team ) , also known as the Albicelestes ( sky blue and whites ) , has appeared in five World Cup finals , including the first final in 1930 , which they lost , 4–2 , to Uruguay .

Team image Uniform The kit first worn by Argentina in their official debut v Uruguay in 1902 was a light blue shirt . On July 2 , 1908 , Argentina debuted the light blue vertical stripe on white jersey , when the squad played vs a team formed by Liga Paulista players at Velódromo Paulistano . That striped jersey has remained as the official kit since then . The away kits usually have been in dark blue shades , varying the colors of shorts and socks . Argentina has sported other kits until the blue strip on white kit was made official . On 3 June 1919 in Rio de Janeiro playing the \" Roberto Chery Cup \" against Brazil , Argentina wore a light blue kit , similar to Uruguay . The trophy was established by Brazilian Football Confederation for the benefit of Roberto Chery \\'s relatives . Chery was Uruguay \\'s substitute goalkeeper and died during the 1919 South American Championship after collapsing in a game against Chile . At the 1958 World Cup , Argentina wore the yellow jersey of Swedish club IFK Malmö in the match against West Germany , as the team arrived in Sweden without an away kit . A last moment jersey changed at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico is memorable . Then manager Carlos Bilardo asked the team kit supplier Le Coq Sportif for a lighter blue shirt for the quarter-final in three days against England , that could not be provided . A member of coaching staff scoured the shops of Mexico City for 38 shirt plain shirts . They were transformed with an improvised version of the AFA emblem embroidered on to the shirts , and silvery American football numbers ironed to the backs . Argentina beat England with Diego Maradona \\'s \" goal of the century \" . The shirt style became an emblem of the occasion and a collector \\'s item . At the 2018 World Cup in Russia , Argentina debuted a black away kit , a first in their history . Kit sponsorship Crest The Argentine Football Association ( \" AFA \" ) logo has been always used as the team emblem . It debuted in the 1958 World Cup held in Sweden , when Argentina added the AFA logo to their jackets , but not to the shirts . Nevertheless , the AFA emblem was not used on jerseys until 16 November 1976 , when Argentina played the Soviet Union at Estadio Monumental . The first emblem was a simplified version of the crest ( without the laurel wreath , that was added for the 1982 World Cup ) . In 2004 , the two stars added above the crest symbolized the national team FIFA World championships of 1978 and 1986 .

Argentina and Uruguay hold the record for most international matches played between two countries . The two teams have faced each other 197 times since 1902 . The first match between Argentina and Uruguay was also the first official international match to be played outside the United Kingdom . Nigeria A minor rivalry developed from the 1990s between Argentina and Nigeria , based not on geographical proximity , long-term battles for honours or factors outside football , but due to the frequency of significant matches between them . This has included five World Cup group games , all won by Argentina by a single goal margin : 2–1 in 1994 , 1–0 in 2002 , 1–0 in 2010 , 3–2 in 2014 and 2–1 in 2018 . The fixture is the most common in the competition \\'s history involving an African nation , and has occurred in five of the six tournaments for which Nigeria has qualified . The sides also met in the 1995 King Fahd Cup ( the predecessor to the Confederations Cup ) as champions of their respective continents , drawing 0–0 . Below full international level , their Olympic teams also faced off in the gold medal match in 1996 ( 3–2 to Nigeria ) , and 2008 ( 1–0 to Argentina ) . The final of the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship was also played between them ; both Argentina goals in their 2–1 win were scored by Lionel Messi , who would go on to find the net for the senior team in the 2014 and 2018 World Cup fixtures . On 6 September 2011 , Bangabandhu National Stadium hosted an international friendly football match between the full-strength Argentina and Nigeria teams , featuring Lionel Messi , Sergio Agüero , Javier Mascherano and John Obi Mikel among the other star players of both nations . Argentina won 3–1 with goals from then-Real Madrid teammates Gonzalo Higuaín and Ángel Di María , and an own goal from Nigeria \\'s Elderson Echiéjilé with Chinedu Obasi scoring Nigeria \\'s lone goal . The sense of rivalry is more keenly felt on the Nigerian side , as Argentina have won almost all of their encounters and have much bigger rivalries with Brazil , England , Germany and Uruguay in contrast to the West Africans who remain keen to finally overcome a more illustrious foe .

He is the current head coach of the Spain national team . A versatile player with good technique , he was capable of playing in several different positions , but usually played as a midfielder or forward , and was also noted for his temperament and stamina . Starting in 1991 and ending in 2004 , he represented both Real Madrid and Barcelona with equal individual and team success , appearing in more than 500 official games and scoring more than 100 goals . He appeared with the Spain national team in three World Cups and one European Championship . Luis Enrique started working as a manager in 2008 with Barcelona B , before moving to Roma three years later . In the 2013–14 season he managed Celta , before returning to Barcelona and winning the treble in his first year and the double in his second ; in 2018 , he was appointed Spain head coach for the first time before resigning for family reasons in 2019 . He reassumed the position the same year and subsequently lead the team to the semi-finals of Euro 2020 and the second place in the 2020–21 Nations League . Playing career Club Luis Enrique was born in Gijón , Asturias , and began his career with local Sporting de Gijón , where he gained the nickname Lucho after Luis Flores , a Mexican forward in the team . He then spent most of his playing days with the two biggest Spanish clubs : first Real Madrid for five seasons and , in 1996 , after seeing out his contract and notably scoring in a 5–0 home win against FC Barcelona in January 1995 , stating later he \" rarely felt appreciated by the Real Madrid supporters and did n\\'t have good memories there \" , he moved to their fierce rivals at the Camp Nou on a free transfer . The Catalans \\' supporters were at first hesitant about their new acquisition , but he soon won the hearts of the cules , staying eight years , eventually becoming team captain and scoring several times in El Clásico against his former employers ; he passionately celebrated at the Santiago Bernabéu , where he grabbed his jersey after a 25-yard strike that beat the opposing goalkeeper . Luis Enrique netted 46 La Liga goals in his first three seasons with Barcelona , with the side finishing runner-up in 1996–97 and subsequently winning back-to-back domestic championship accolades . Furthermore , he was named Spanish Player of the Year by El País in the following campaign . He also scored the opening goal in the 1997 UEFA Super Cup , a 3–1 aggregate triumph against Borussia Dortmund . During his final years in Barcelona , Luis Enrique was often injured , and did not want to renew his contract . He had been offered a deal by his first club Sporting , which he , however , declined , stating that \" he would n\\'t be able to reach the level he demanded of himself \" and that \" he would n\\'t be doing Sporting much of a favour by going there . \" His concerns about his level and fitness made him retire on 10 August 2004 at the age of 34 , and he finished his professional career with league totals of 400 games and 102 goals , being named by Pelé as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March . International Luis Enrique played for Spain in three FIFA World Cups : 1994 , 1998 and 2002 ( as well as UEFA Euro 1996 ) , and scored 12 goals while gaining 62 caps . He was also a member of the gold-winning squad at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , and made his debut for the main side on 17 April 1991 , featuring for 22 minutes in a 0–2 friendly loss to Romania in Cáceres . In the 1994 World Cup , held in the United States , Luis Enrique scored his first international goal , in the round-of-16 3–0 win over Switzerland in Washington , D.C . In the 1–2 quarter-final defeat against Italy at Foxboro Stadium , Mauro Tassotti \\'s elbow made contact with his face to bloody effect , but during the match the incident went unpunished – Tassotti was banned for eight games afterwards ; when Spain met Italy at Euro 2008 on 22 June , to battle for a place in the semi-finals , Luis Enrique reportedly called for the team to \" take revenge \" for the 1994 World Cup incident by beating Italy . Tassotti , an assistant coach with A.C . Milan at the time , told the newspaper Marca that he was tired of always being reminded of this incident , and that he had never intended to hurt the Spaniard . At the 1998 World Cup , Luis Enrique played a major role in a 6–1 rout of Bulgaria in the last game of the group , scoring and assisting once and also winning a penalty , but the Spaniards were eliminated nonetheless . On 5 June of the following year he netted a hat-trick , in a 9–0 win in Villarreal over San Marino in the Euro 2000 qualifiers . On 23 June 2002 , Luis Enrique retired from international football , in order to give the younger players more playing time and focus only on his club . Player profile Having occupied several different positions , Luis Enrique was most noted for his exceptional versatility and consistency . He was capable of playing anywhere in midfield or along the front line , and was fielded in all positions on the pitch throughout his career , except those of central defender and goalkeeper . A strong , courageous , energetic and hard-working team player , with good technical skills , flair and notable stamina , his usual position was as an attacking midfielder in the centre of the pitch , due to his ability to link-up the forwards and the midfield , or as a right winger , but he was capable of playing anywhere along the right flank , and was often deployed as an attacking full back or wing-back , or even as a left winger on occasion . Due to his keen eye for goal and ability to make attacking runs into the box , Luis Enrique frequently played as a forward , either in a withdrawn role as a second striker behind the team \\'s main goalscorer , or even as an out-and-out striker or centre forward – he was also used in deeper midfield roles . In addition to his playing abilities , he also stood out for his commitment , temperament , determination and leadership . Coaching career Barcelona B On 26 May 2008 , Luis Enrique returned to Barcelona , taking over the reins of the B team , renamed Barcelona Atlètic for that season . As he succeeded long-time Barcelona teammate Pep Guardiola , he stated : \" I have come home \" , and \" I finished playing here and now I will start coaching here . \" ; in his second season he found success , helping the club return to Segunda División after an absence of 11 years . In mid-March 2011 , Luis Enrique announced he would leave at the end of the campaign , despite still having two years left on his contract . He led the side to the playoffs , but they were ineligible for promotion . Roma On 8 June 2011 , Luis Enrique reached an agreement with Italian Serie A club A.S . Roma to become the Giallorossis new head coach . He signed a two-year contract , being joined by a staff of four members , including Iván de la Peña who played two years for crosstown rivals S.S . Lazio , as technical collaborator . Roma was eliminated from the UEFA Europa League by ŠK Slovan Bratislava , amid great discussion of the substitution of legendary Francesco Totti for Stefano Okaka . The capital-based side also lost their first game in the domestic league against Cagliari Calcio , making it just the third time that they lost the opener in 18 years . Even though he still had two years remaining on his contract , Luis Enrique decided to leave Roma at the end of the season after failure to qualify for any European competition . Celta On 8 June 2013 , Luis Enrique became RC Celta de Vigo \\'s new manager , replacing former national teammate Abel Resino . He led the Galicians to the ninth position in his first and only season , highlights including a 2–0 home win against Real Madrid that ended the opposition \\'s possibilities of winning the league title . On 16 May 2014 , Luis Enrique announced that he would be leaving Celta . Barcelona On 19 May 2014 , Luis Enrique returned to Barcelona as a manager on a two-year deal . He was recommended by sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta , his former national teammate . His first competitive match was a 3–0 home league win over Elche CF , where he handed debuts to new signings Claudio Bravo , Jérémy Mathieu and Ivan Rakitić , and gave youth products Munir El Haddadi , Rafinha and Sandro their maiden league appearances for the club , while summer signing Luis Suárez was unavailable for selection due to suspension . Luis Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25 October 2014 , away against Real Madrid , and although Barcelona had a successful run in the year , his management came under scrutiny because of his tactics involving several lineup changes in consecutive games . Moreover , a quarrel with Lionel Messi and other players further accentuated the team \\'s poor form . Amid reports of dressing room unrest , in early January , and on back of a defeat to Real Sociedad Zubizarreta was sacked , weakening Luis Enrique \\'s standing at the club . A significant upturn in form followed , as a result of the coach deciding on a settled lineup with a tweak in the formation : Messi and Neymar now played as inverted wingers , while Suárez was the lone striker . The team won at home to champions Atlético Madrid who had previously defeated them 6 times in a row in all competitions . He soon equaled Guardiola \\'s record of 11 consecutive victories , while the side went on to beat Atlético Madrid and Villarreal CF convincingly in the Copa del Rey to advance to the final . In the domestic league , after eight wins in nine matches , they returned to the top of the table after 15 weeks . On 21 April 2015 , Luis Enrique recorded his 42nd win after 50 games in charge of Barcelona with a 2–0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain FC , the best record of any manager . He went on to lead the club to the final of the UEFA Champions League and , on 17 May , led it to its 23rd national championship with one match to spare following a 1–0 win at the Vicente Calderón Stadium against Atlético Madrid . On 6 June , having earlier won the domestic cup against Athletic Bilbao by the same score , the team sealed a treble with a 3–1 defeat of Juventus F.C . in the Champions League Final in Berlin , and three days later he signed a new contract until 2017 . On 11 August 2015 , Barcelona won the 2015 UEFA Super Cup 5–4 against Sevilla FC . On 2 December , against CF Villanovense in the Copa del Rey round of 32 , Luis Enrique decided against bringing on a new player following Mathieu \\'s injury with 12 minutes to go even though two replacements could still be made , as the score was at 6–1 at that time and the manager said he did not want to risk further setbacks . In his first two seasons , Luis Enrique rotated his goalkeepers , with Bravo playing league games and Marc-André ter Stegen playing cup and European matches . Both players , however , expressed opposition to this policy . A second double was achieved on 22 May 2016 , following a 2–0 Copa del Rey victory over Sevilla FC after extra time in which the team played more than 50 minutes with one player less , following the dismissal of Javier Mascherano . On 1 March 2017 , Luis Enrique announced that he would not continue as team manager after 30 June on expiration of his contract . Spain Luis Enrique was named coach of the Spanish national team on 9 July 2018 , replacing former club and country teammate Fernando Hierro . His first match in charge occurred on 8 September , and he led the side to a 2–1 win against England in the UEFA Nations League at Wembley Stadium . In November 2019 , Luis Enrique rejoined the national team after having quit his post for personal reasons four months prior . Speaking to the press after his return , a visibly angry Enrique alleged his friend and colleague of six years Robert Moreno — who managed the national team after his resignation — was \" disloyal \" and wanted to hold on to his interim position . When Luis Enrique selected a 24-man Euro 2020 squad — despite being allowed 26 — that contained no Real Madrid players , he was accused of having an anti-Madrid bias . Several high-profile omissions from his squad were seen as a way for him to assert control over the dressing room and the team . However , he led Spain to the tournament \\'s semi-finals , in which they lost against Italy on penalties after a 1–1 draw . Manager profile Tactics Luis Enrique \\'s incisive and direct football featuring quick transitions from defense to attack , though reliant on the front three of Messi , Suárez and Neymar , was in sharp contrast to the possession-heavy approach of Barcelona managers immediately prior to him . Statistically , Luis Enrique \\'s Barcelona , in his first two years at the club , were better than Guardiola \\'s : Comparatively his team had scored more goals and conceded fewer , had a higher win percentage and won competitions at a similar rate . Guardiola hailed them as the best counter-attacking team in the world . In his first two seasons at the Camp Nou , Luis Enrique fielded a 4–3–3 formation . Results improved after he stopped tinkering with his starting eleven . The team \\'s creative outlet was the wings with Neymar and Messi as inside forwards flanking Suárez , a departure from their usual playing style . Ivan Rakitić played a pivotal role in transitioning defense to attack , and Andrés Iniesta \\'s influence withered , while Xavi , the club \\'s captain , reduced to a part-time , substitute role . With overlapping full-backs offering width , Neymar and Messi often drifted in-field , encouraging midfielders , Rakitic and Iniesta , to move into channels and attack in and around the box . In his third and final year , struggling for form and results , the manager switched to a 3–4–3 offense morphing into a 4–4–2 defensive shape , reminiscent of Antonio Conte \\'s Premier League winners Chelsea more than Johan Cryuff \\'s Dream Team , with Messi at the top of a midfield diamond , acting as chief play-maker , and Sergio Busquets , the sole holding defensive midfielder , responsible for breaking the first-line of opposition press . The system favoured Neymar in particular , who played as a left forward , often cutting inside to link with lone striker Suárez , or to create an overload in the final-third sharing creative responsibilities with Messi . This change in formation was instrumental as they overcame 0–4 , the biggest first-leg deficit in Champions League history , by defeating PSG 6–1 in the second-leg ; however , the physical and tactical discipline required to sustain a 3–4–3 proved controversial . For Spain , Luis Enrique continues to favour 4–3–3 , and at times the riskier 3–4–3 when the situation demands , with the sole defensive midfielder in the pivot being the only commonality . Lacking the front three he had at Barcelona , his football retains positional and vertical aspects , though with box-to-box central midfielders , like Koke or Pedri , offering attacking thrust while the center forward drops deep to bring wide forwards into play , accompanied by overlapping full-backs who offer width . Whilst pressing oppositions high-up , the center forward , usually Álvaro Morata , screens the opposition defensive midfielder as wide forwards engage opposition center backs . Spain \\'s defensive midfielder , often Busquets , tracks the run of opposition attackers when they drop deep , some times pressing higher than the team \\'s other central midfielders . In possession , Spain usually start playing out from the back , to draw the opposition in , with Thiago Alcântara or any other central midfielder , dropping alongside Busquets to help progress the ball forward . Should the opposition press aggressively , the full-backs link up to offer additional passing options as the center backs go deep and narrow . Wide forwards make diagonal runs into the midfield to link play with those in front of them . Once the ball has been progressed out of the defense , they adjust their attacking rhythm to match opposition \\'s defensive structure , either opting for a speedy transition against a higher block or relying on a more positional approach play against a lower block . To mix it up , Spain initially build up short in the defensive-third to then play long to the center forward who then attempts to bring outfield runners in to play . Wing play is used to stretch opposition and create spaces infield or create crossing opportunities , especially against compact defenses . Known for his brave and fearless management style , Luis Enrique is quick to curb out source of any influence that undermines his authority . Reports of his altercation with Messi at Barcelona and with Totti at Roma , both of whom wield considerable power at their respective clubs , being prime examples of that . His flexibility in adopting different playing styles , while at odds with the possession-based style synonymous with Barcelona , furthered this narrative , as he continued to remain unfazed in the face of criticism and pressure . Royal Spanish Football Federation president Luis Rubiales , on the back of three consecutive unsuccessful tournaments , appointed him to curb ill-discipline and complacency in the squad , stating : \" We are looking for an incontestable leader , who sets out the path , and nobody then strays from that path . \" Reception Messi described Luis Enrique as one the two best managers he has played for , the other being Guardiola . While Guardiola maintains that though he has played against many great footballing sides as a manager , Luis Enrique \\'s Barcelona and Jürgen Klopp \\'s Liverpool were the best he has ever faced . In comparing the managers he has played for , Spain international Alcântara said , \" [ Luis Enrique ] has the analytical positioning of Pep [ and ] the aggressiveness of Klopp \" while also praising Luis Enrique \\'s communication skills in conveying his footballing ideas . Endorsements Luis Enrique was sponsored by sportswear company Nike , and appeared in commercials for the brand . In a global advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in South Korea and Japan , he starred in a \" Secret Tournament \" commercial ( branded \" Scorpion KO \" ) directed by Terry Gilliam , appearing alongside footballers such as Luís Figo , Thierry Henry , Hidetoshi Nakata , Roberto Carlos , Ronaldinho , Ronaldo and Totti , with former player Eric Cantona the tournament \" referee \" . Personal life After retiring from football , Luis Enrique lived for a while in Australia to practise surfing . He took part in the 2005 edition of the New York City Marathon , finished the Amsterdam Marathon in 2006 , the Firenze Marathon in 2007 and the Marathon des Sables in 2008 , while also entering and finishing Frankfurt Ironman in 2007 . He was due to take part in the Klagenfurt Ironman competition in July 2008 , but eventually declined due to his engagement as manager of Barcelona B . Luis Enrique married his longtime partner Elena Cullell on 27 December 1997 . Their daughter , Xana , died of bone cancer at age 9 on 29 August 2019 .

Professional athleticism has come to the fore through a combination of developments . Mass media and increased leisure have brought larger audiences , so that sports organizations or teams can command large incomes . As a result , more sportspeople can afford to make athleticism their primary career , devoting the training time necessary to increase skills , physical condition , and experience to modern levels of achievement . This proficiency has also helped boost the popularity of sports . Most sports played professionally also have amateur players far outnumbering the professionals . History Baseball Baseball originated before the American Civil War ( 1861–1865 ) . First played on sandlots in particular , scoring and record-keeping gave baseball gravity . \" Today , \" notes John Thorn in The Baseball Encyclopedia , \" baseball without records is inconceivable . \" In 1871 , the first professional baseball league was created . By the beginning of the 20th century , most large cities in the eastern United States had a professional baseball team . After several leagues came and went in the 19th century , the National League ( founded in 1876 ) and American League ( recognized as a major league in 1903 ) were established as the dominant leagues by the early 20th century . The most victorious team in each league was said to have won the \" pennant ; \" the two pennant winners met after the end of the regular season in the World Series . The winner of at least four games ( out of a possible seven ) was the champion for that year . This arrangement still holds today , although the leagues are now subdivided and pennants are decided in post-season playoff series between the winners of each division . Baseball became popular in the 1920s , when Babe Ruth led the New York Yankees to several World Series titles and became a national hero on the strength of his home runs ( balls that can not be played because they have been hit out of the field ) . One of the most noteworthy players was the Brooklyn Dodgers \\' Jackie Robinson , who became the first African-American player in the major leagues in 1947 . Prior to Robinson , black players had been restricted to the Negro leagues . Starting in the 1950s , major league baseball expanded its geographical range . Western cities got teams , either by luring them to move from eastern cities or by forming expansion teams with players made available by established teams . Until the 1970s , because of strict contracts , the owners of baseball teams also virtually owned the players ; since then , the rules have changed so that players can become free agents , within certain limits , to sell their services to any team . The resulting bidding wars led to increasingly wealthy players . Disputes between the players \\' union and the owners have at times halted baseball for months at a time . Japan has also seen a prominent professional baseball circuit develop known as Nippon Professional Baseball . Founded in 1934 , the league emerged as an international force after World War II . NPB is considered to be the highest caliber of baseball outside the U.S . major leagues , and the best Japanese talent often emigrate to the U.S . by way of the posting system . Other prominent countries to play the game include South Korea ( where their league has its own posting system with Major League Baseball ) , Taiwan , Mexico , Latin America , and the Caribbean states . American football Football ( commonly known as American football in Europe and Australia ) was professionalized in the 1890s as a slow , and initially covert , process ; Pudge Heffelfinger and Ben \" Sport \" Donnelly were the first to secretly accept payment for playing the game in 1892 . Regional leagues in Chicago , Pennsylvania , Ohio and New York had coalesced in the 1900s and 1910s , most of which gave way to the American Professional Football Association in 1920 . By 1920 , pro football remained overshadowed by the college game . The first game involving an APFA team took place on 26 September 1920 , at Douglas Park in Rock Island , Illinois , as the hometown Independents flattened the St . Paul Ideals 48–0 . The first head-to-head battles in the league occurred one week later as Dayton topped Columbus 14-0 and Rock Island pasted Muncie 45–0 . Forward passes were rare , coaching from the sidelines was prohibited and players competed on both offense and defense . Money was so tight that George Halas carried equipment , wrote press releases , sold tickets , taped ankles , played and coached for the Decatur club . As opposed to today \\'s standard 16-game schedule , clubs in 1920 scheduled their own opponents and could play non league and even college squads that counted toward their records . With no established guidelines , the number of games played—and the quality of opponents scheduled—by APFA teams varied , and the league did not maintain official standings . The inaugural season was a struggle . Games received little attention from the fans—and even less from the press . According to Robert W . Peterson \\'s book \" Pigskin : The Early Years of Pro Football , \" APFA games averaged crowds of 4,241 . The association bylaws called for teams to pay a $ 100 entry fee , but no one ever did . The season concluded on 19 December . At the conclusion of the season there were no playoffs ( that innovation , although New York \\'s regional league had used it , would not arrive until 1933 ) and it took more than four months before the league even bothered to crown a champion . Much as college football did for decades , the APFA determined its victor by ballot . On 30 April 1921 , team representatives voted the Akron Pros , who completed the season undefeated with eight wins and three ties while yielding only a total of seven points , the champion in spite of protests by the one-loss teams in Decatur and Buffalo , who each had tied Akron and had more wins , thanks in part to Akron \\'s owner presiding over the meeting . The victors received a silver loving cup donated by sporting goods company Brunswick-Balke-Collender . While players were not given diamond-encrusted rings , they did receive golden fobs in the shape of a football inscribed with the words \" World Champions . \" The whereabouts of the Brunswick-Balke Collender Cup , only given out that one time , are unknown . The legacy of two APFA franchises continues on , however . The Racine Cardinals now play in Arizona , and the Decatur Staleys moved to Chicago in 1921 and changed their name to the Bears the following year . Ten APFA players along with Carr are enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame , which opened its doors in 1963 not far from the Canton automobile dealership that gave birth to the NFL in 1920 . The APFA , by 1922 known as the National Football League , has remained the predominant professional football league in the United States , and , effectively , the entire world . The evolution from a haphazard collection of teams in big and small cities to the much more rigid structure it is in the present was gradual . With most of the small-market teams except the Green Bay Packers squeezed out of the NFL by the time of the Great Depression , multiple attempts at teams in the major cities of Washington , New York , Detroit , Cleveland , and Philadelphia failed before , eventually , their current representatives took root ( though Boston proved particularly problematic until the New England Patriots were accepted into the NFL in 1970 ) ; the NFL expanded coast-to-coast , the first of the four major leagues to do so , in 1946 with the Los Angeles Rams and admitted the San Francisco 49ers four years later ; the NFL did not enter the Southern United States until admitting the Dallas Cowboys , Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints in the 1960s . A championship game was established in 1933 , a draft was established in 1936 , and schedules were standardized in the 1930s . A competing league has historically arisen to attempt to challenge the NFL \\'s dominance every 10 to 15 years , but none managed to maintain long-term operations independent of the NFL and only two—the All-America Football Conference of the late 1940s and the American Football League of the 1960s—were strong enough to successfully compete against the league before the NFL subsumed their operations . Minor league football , although their leagues \\' memberships were unstable , began to arise in the late 1930s and remained viable as a business model up into the 1970s . A major factor in the NFL \\'s rise to dominance was its embrace of television early in the sport \\'s history . As college football heavily restricted the rights of its teams to broadcast games ( a policy eventually ruled to be illegal in 1984 ) , the NFL instead allowed games to be televised nationwide , except in a team \\'s home city ; the restriction was softened in the early 1970s , by which point the NFL had secured broadcast deals with all of the major television networks , another major factor in the inability of any competing league to gain traction since then . The related sport of Canadian football was eventually professionalized by the 1950s , which saw the evolution of the Canadian Football League . The CFL , despite losing all games in a series of contests against the NFL , was considered to be at least comparable in talent to the American leagues of the 1960s ( its lone game against an AFL squad was a victory ) . Because Canada has a tenth of the population of the United States , the ability to make money from television was much lower , and although some of the cities of Canada were comparable to the major markets of the U.S. , teams in places such as Saskatchewan and Hamilton were in markets quite small compared to even the small markets of the NFL , thus the CFL now pays noticeably less than other major professional leagues , but still more than enough to be considered fully professional . The rise of indoor American football beginning in the late 1980s has allowed for smaller-scale professional football to be viable . Basketball Basketball was invented in 1891 and the first professional leagues emerged in the 1920 \\'s . The Basketball Association of America was established in 1946 and three years later became the modern National Basketball Association . The NBA was slower to establish dominance of the sport than other sports in the United States , as it would not do so until 1976 , when it absorbed four teams from the American Basketball Association . Professional basketball has the advantages of much smaller rosters than other professional sports , allowing the sport to be viable in smaller cities than other sports . Professional basketball leagues of varying caliber can be found around the world , especially in Europe and South America . It has many good basketball players Basketball mainly became popular in the early 1980 \\'s when Magic Johnson and Larry Bird joined the NBA and lead their teams to multiple NBA titles . They are considered two of the best players of all time usually underneath Michael Jordan . Michael Jordan also gained the NBA views with carrying the Chicago bulls to 6 titles in the 1990 \\'s . Cricket In the 1920s , Britain saw some cricketers from the Caribbean to play professional cricket . After World War II , professional cricketers from the Indian subcontinent were enlisted in British teams . Ice hockey Ice hockey was first professionalized in Pittsburgh in the early 1900s ( decade ) . As Canadians made up the vast majority of hockey players , early American professional leagues imported almost all of their talent before Canadian leagues began to form in the wake of a mining boom , depriving the U.S . leagues and teams of talent . Two distinct circuits formed : the Pacific Coast Hockey Association in western Canada and the northwestern U.S. , and the National Hockey Association of central Canada , both of which competed for the then-independent Stanley Cup . The NHA \\'s teams reorganized as the National Hockey League in 1917 , and the West Coast circuit died out by the mid-1920s . By 1926 , the NHL expanded to 10 teams in Canada , and in the northeastern and midwestern United States . However , the onset of the Great Depression in 1930s , combined with Canada \\'s entry into World War II ( which greatly reduced the league \\'s player pool ) , led to the league \\'s retrenchment to six markets : Boston , New York City , Chicago and Detroit in the U.S. , and Toronto and Montreal in Canada . These Original Six cities would be the only cities with NHL franchises from 1935 to 1967 . During this time , the NHL was both stagnant and restrictive in its policies , giving teams territorial advantages , having teams with multiple owners in the same family ( thus allowing the best players to be stacked onto certain teams ) , and restricting its players \\' salaries through reserve clauses . This stagnation allowed other leagues to arise : the Western Hockey League soon became the de facto major league of the western states and provinces , and the second-tier American Hockey League emerged in a number of midwestern markets the NHL had neglected , in addition to a handful of small towns . Amid pressure from television networks that were threatening to offer the WHL a contract , the NHL doubled in size in 1967 , beginning a period of expansion that lasted through much of the 1970s . The last major challenger to the NHL \\'s dominance was the World Hockey Association , which successfully broke the NHL \\'s reserve clause in court , drove up professional hockey salaries , and continued to pressure the older league into expansion . The WHA merged four of its remaining teams into the NHL in 1979 , but had to give up most of its players , as they were still under NHL contract and had to return to their original teams . The NHL made its last pronounced realignment in the 1990s , moving most of the WHA teams out of their markets and establishing a number of new teams in the southern United States . In Europe , the introduction of professionalism varied widely , and the highest-caliber league on the continent , the Soviet Championship League ( proven to be at least equal to or better than the NHL in the 1970s ) , was officially populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company ( aircraft industry , food workers , tractor industry ) or organization ( KGB , Red Army , Soviet Air Force ) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours social sports society hockey team for their workers . In other words , all Soviet hockey players were de facto professionals who circumvented the amateur rules of the International Olympic Committee to retain their amateur status and compete in the Olympics . The modern-day descendant of the Soviet league , the Kontinental Hockey League , is fully professional and has some teams outside Russia , to the point where it has the resources to sign NHL veterans . Other European countries such as Germany , Sweden , Switzerland , Norway , Finland , and Austria also have prominent professional leagues . Opposition to professionalism Professional athleticism has been a traditional object of criticism by proponents of the amateur philosophy of sport , according to which the central ethos of sport is competition performed for its own sake and pure enjoyment rather than as a means of earning a living . Examples of amateur philosophy include the muscular Christianity movement that informed the promotion of sports in the English public school system , and the Olympism advocated by Pierre de Coubertin , a force behind the revival of the modern Olympic Games . The tension between the two sporting practices and ideals dates from the inception of modern organized sports in the 19th century . The high political and financial stakes involved in sport have ensured that this tension has remained strong . Professional sporting organizations have often developed as \" rebel \" organizations in relation to established national and international federation , for example the schism which created the code of rugby league . Arguments against amateurism often appeal to the argument that amateurism in sport favors the classes who can afford not to be paid to play , and is thus a covert form of prejudice against lower classes . Another argument is that amateur players are often de facto professionals who retain their amateur status by earning allowances instead of salaries . For example , all Eastern bloc countries were populated with amateur players who were actually full-time athletes hired as regular workers of a company ( aircraft industry , food workers , tractor industry ) or organization ( KGB , Red Army , Soviet Air Force ) that sponsored what would be presented as an after-hours social sports society team for their workers . Christians in the Wesleyan-Holiness movement , which adheres to the position of first-day Sabbatarianism , oppose the viewing of or participation in professional sports , believing that professional sports leagues profane the Sabbath as in the modern era , certain associations hold games on the Lord \\'s Day ( such as in the United States ) . They also criticize professional sports for its fostering of a commitment that competes with a Christian \\'s primary commitment to God in opposition to , what they perceive to be a lack of modesty in the players \\' and cheerleaders \\' uniforms ( which are not in conformity with the Methodistic doctrine of outward holiness ) , its association with violence in opposition to , what they perceive to be the extensive use of profanity among many players that contravenes , and the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs at sporting events that go against a commitment to teetotalism . Professional sports has been criticized for the gambling that is associated with it . Laestadian Lutherans , who belong to the Pietistic Lutheran tradition , likewise teach that \" Competitive sports are not acceptable , but we should maintain fitness through various forms of exercise . \" Sports salaries Professional sportsmen can earn a great deal of money at the highest levels . For instance , the highest-paid team in professional baseball is New York Yankees . Per Forbes 2021 ranking , the highest-paid athletes include Cristiano Ronaldo , Lionel Messi , Naomi Osaka , Tiger Woods , Serena Williams and wrestler-turned-actor The Rock . The top ten tennis players make about $ 3 million a year on average . Much of the growth in income for sports and athletes has come from broadcasting rights ; for example , the most recent television contract for the NFL is valued at nearly US $ 5 billion per year . Women in the U.S. , on the other hand , make much less , for example as of 2014 , the WNBA enforced a maximum salary of US $ 107,000 for star players ( coaches could earn double that ) . Average in-person attendance and television viewership are both far higher for the NBA compared to the WNBA . Outside the highest leagues , however , the money professional athletes can earn drops dramatically , as fan bases are generally smaller and television revenues are nonexistent . For instance , while the National Football League \\'s teams can afford to pay their players millions of dollars each year and still maintain a significant profit , the second-highest American football league in the United States , the United Football League , consistently struggled to pay its bills and has continually lost money despite allotting its players only US $ 20,000 a year , and television networks made the league pay for television airtime instead of paying the league , making the league \\'s business model unworkable . In the United States and Canada , most lower-end professional leagues run themselves as affiliated farm teams , effectively agreeing to develop younger players for eventual play in the major leagues in exchange for subsidizing those players \\' salaries ; this is known as the minor league system and is most prevalent in professional baseball and professional ice hockey . Otherwise , the league may be required to classify itself as semi-professional , in other words , able to pay their players a small sum , but not enough to cover the player \\'s basic costs of living . Many professional athletes experience financial difficulties soon after retiring , due to a combination of bad investments , careless spending , and a lack of non-athletic skills . The wear and tear of a career in professional sport , can cause physical and mental side effects ( such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a condition that has seen a massive rise in public awareness in the 2010s ) that can harm a former professional athlete \\'s employability . In the United States , some of these problems are mitigated by the fact that the college sports system ensures most professional athletes receive a college education with no student debt , a legacy that provides them with a career path after their sports career ends . American football In the NFL average annual salaries by position in 2009 were : Quarterback $ 1,970,982 ( note that this is a mean that covers both starting quarterbacks and backups ; starters regularly draw salaries of over $ 10,000,000 as of 2016 ) Running back $ 957,360 Defensive tackle $ 1,223,925 Association football Chinese Super League The average salary of a player in the Chinese Super League was about ¥10.7 million ( £1 million ) for the 2011 season , up from ¥600,000 in the 2010 season . The highest-paid player for the 2011 Chinese Super League season was Dario Conca of Guangzhou Evergrande who received an annual salary of ¥67.4 million ( $ 10.5 million ) after income tax , putting him among the highest-paid players in the world . Russian Premier League The highest-paid player for the 2011–2012 Russian Premier League season was Samuel Eto \\' o of Anzhi Makhachkala , who at the end of the 2011–12 season was expected to receive a total salary of RUB 900.2 million ( £35.7 million ) after income tax , making Eto \\' o the second highest-earning athlete in the world and the highest-paid footballer in the world followed by Lionel Messi and Zlatan Ibrahimović . Bundesliga The average salary of a player in the German Bundesliga was about €3.3 million ( £2.5 million ) for the 2010–11 season , up from €2.5 million in the 2009–2010 Bundesliga season . The highest-paid player for the 2010–11 Bundesliga season was Franck Ribéry of Bayern Munich who received a salary of €6.3 million after income tax . Serie A In the Italian top league , Serie A , the average salary was about €5 million for the 2010–2011 Serie A season , up from €1 million in the 2005–2006 Serie A season . The highest-paid player for the 2010–2011 Serie A season was Zlatan Ibrahimović of A.C . Milan who received a salary of €25.9 million after income tax and which also includes Ibrahimović \\'s bonuses and endorsements . La Liga Lionel Messi of FC Barcelona is the world \\'s second highest-paid player receiving a salary of £29.6 million ( over US $ 45 million ) a year after income taxation and which also includes the incomes of Messi \\'s bonuses and endorsements . In the Spanish La Liga , the average salary for the players of Lionel Messi \\'s club FC Barcelona was €6.5 million for the 2010–2011 La Liga season , up from €5.5 million for the 2009–2010 La Liga season . Premier League The average salary of a player in the English Premier League was about £2.6 million in the 2017–18 season , compared with about £1.2 million in 2007–08 and £676,000 in 2006–07 . Even as early as 2010–11 , top players such as John Terry and Steven Gerrard could make up to £7 million per year with the players of Premier League club Manchester City F.C . receiving an average salary of £2 million in that season . Premier League salaries have boomed in more recent years thanks to massive television deals and wealthy new investors in clubs . Terry \\'s and Gerrard \\'s 2010–11 salaries would not have placed them among the top 25 earners in 2017–18 . In that season , more than 20 players earned more than £10 million , led by Alexis Sánchez ( £21.5 million ) and Mesut Özil ( £20.9 million ) . The Premier League \\'s two Manchester clubs had the highest average salaries in 2017–18 , with players for both Manchester United and Manchester City averaging over £5.2 million . Players in lower divisions make significantly less money . In 2006–07 the average salary of a player in the Championship ( the second tier of the English football pyramid ) made £195,750 while the average salary for League One and League Two ( tiers 3 and 4 ) combined were £49,600 . Major League Soccer The highest salary in Major League Soccer in 2019 was the $ 14 million paid to former Swedish international Zlatan Ibrahimović , who played for the LA Galaxy in that season . Ibrahimović was signed to his 2019 contract under MLS \\' Designated Player Rule , which was instituted in 2007 for the express purpose of attracting international stars . Now-retired English star David Beckham was the first player signed under its provisions . When the rule was instituted , each team had one \" Designated Player \" slot with a salary cap charge of $ 400,000 , but no limit on actual salary paid . Since then , the number of Designated Players per team has increased to three , with each counting for $ 530,000 of cap room in 2019 . The league \\'s average salary was about $ 283,000 per year in 2015 , but the median salary was then closer to $ 110,000 . MLS \\' minimum player salary in 2019 is $ 70,250 for most players , and for players on the reserve roster ( slots # 25-28 ) the minimum salary is $ 56,250 . Baseball In 1970 , the average salary in Major League Baseball in the U.S . and Canada was $ 20,000 ( $ inflation-adjusted ) . By 2005 , the average salary had increased to $ 2,632,655 ( $ inflation-adjusted ) and the minimum salary was $ 316,000 ( adjusted : $ ) . In 2012 the average MLB salary was $ 3,440,000 , the median salary was $ 1,075,000 , and the minimum salary had grown to four times the inflation-adjusted average salary in 1970 ( $ 480,000 ) . Cricket In the Indian Premier League in 2019 , players earn an average of $ 101,444 , and a median salary of $ 72,450 , per week . The top-paid players in international cricket in 2017 across the ( at the time ) 10 Test cricket nations earned anywhere from $ 90,000 to $ 1,470,000 ( when looking only at contract and match fees ) .

Often considered the best player in the world and widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time , Ronaldo has won five Ballon d\\'Or awards and four European Golden Shoes , the most by a European player . He has won 32 trophies in his career , including seven league titles , five UEFA Champions Leagues , one UEFA European Championship , and one UEFA Nations League . Ronaldo holds the records for most appearances ( 182 ) , most goals ( 140 ) , and assists ( 42 ) in the Champions League , most goals in the European Championship ( 14 ) , most international goals by a male player ( 115 ) , and most international appearances by a European male ( 184 ) . He is one of the few players to have made over 1,100 professional career appearances , and has scored over 800 official senior career goals for club and country . Born and raised in Madeira , Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP , before signing with Manchester United in 2003 , aged 18 , winning the FA Cup in his first season . He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles , the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup ; at age 23 , he won his first Ballon d\\'Or . Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million ( £80 million ) , where he won 15 trophies , including two La Liga titles , two Copa del Rey , and four Champions Leagues , and became the club \\'s all-time top goalscorer . He won back-to-back Ballons d\\'Or in 2013 and 2014 , and again in 2016 and 2017 , and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi , his perceived career rival . In 2018 , he signed for Juventus in a transfer worth an initial €100 million ( £88 million ) , the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and the most expensive transfer for a player over 30 years old . He won two Serie A titles , two Supercoppe Italiana , and a Coppa Italia , before returning to Manchester United in 2021 . Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned over 180 caps , making him Portugal \\'s most-capped player . With more than 100 goals at international level , he is also the nation \\'s all-time top goalscorer . He has played in and scored at 11 major tournaments ; he scored his first international goal at Euro 2004 , where he helped Portugal reach the final . He assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008 . In 2015 , Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation . The following year , he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at Euro 2016 , and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament . He also led them to victory in the inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019 , and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of Euro 2020 . One of the world \\'s most marketable and famous athletes , Ronaldo was ranked the world \\'s highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world \\'s most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019 . Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014 . He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US $ 1 billion in his career . Early life Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in the São Pedro parish of Funchal , the capital of the Portuguese island of Madeira , and grew up in the nearby parish of Santo António . He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro , a cook , and José Dinis Aveiro , a municipal gardener and part-time kit man . His great-grandmother on his father \\'s side , Isabel da Piedade , was from the island of São Vicente , Cape Verde . He has one older brother , Hugo , and two older sisters , Elma and Liliana Cátia \" Katia \" . His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty , his father \\'s alcoholism and having too many children already , but her doctor refused to perform the procedure . Ronaldo grew up in an impoverished Catholic home , sharing a room with all his siblings . As a child , Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995 , where his father was the kit man , and later spent two years with Nacional . In 1997 , aged 12 , he went on a three-day trial with Sporting CP , who signed him for a fee of £1,500 . He subsequently moved from Madeira to Alcochete , near Lisbon , to join Sporting \\'s youth academy . By age 14 , Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother to cease his education to focus entirely on football . While popular with other students at school , he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher , who he said had \" disrespected \" him . One year later , he was diagnosed with tachycardia , a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football . Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used to cauterise multiple cardiac pathways into one , altering his resting heart rate . He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later . Club career Sporting CP At age 16 , Ronaldo was promoted from Sporting \\'s youth team by first-team manager László Bölöni , who was impressed with his dribbling . He subsequently became the first player to play for the club \\'s under-16 , under-17 and under-18 teams , the B team and the first team , all within a single season . A year later , on 29 September 2002 , Ronaldo made his debut in the Primeira Liga , against Braga and on 7 October , he scored two goals against Moreirense in their 3–0 win . Over the course of the 2002–03 season , his representatives suggested the player to Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier and Barcelona president Joan Laporta . Manager Arsène Wenger , who was interested in signing Ronaldo , met with him at Arsenal \\'s grounds in November to discuss a possible transfer . Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson was determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently , after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of the Estádio José Alvalade in August 2003 . Initially , United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year . Having been impressed by him , the United players urged Ferguson to sign him . After the game , Ferguson agreed to pay Sporting £12.24 million for what he considered to be \" one of the most exciting young players \" he had ever seen . A decade after his departure from the club , in April 2013 , Sporting honoured Ronaldo by selecting him to become their 100,000th member . Manchester United 2003–2007 : Development and breakthrough Ronaldo \\'s move to Manchester United was completed on 12 August 2003 , too late for the 2003 FA Community Shield but in time for their game against Bolton Wanderers on the opening day of the 2003–04 season , and made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club . His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him , at the time , the most expensive teenager in English football history . Although he requested the number 28 , his number at Sporting , he received the squad number 7 shirt , which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best , Eric Cantona and David Beckham . Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo . A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson , of whom he later said : \" He \\'s been my father in sport , one of the most important and influential factors in my career . \" Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win over Bolton in the Premier League on 16 August 2003 , and received a standing ovation when he came on for Nicky Butt . His performance earned praise from Best , who hailed it as \" undoubtedly the most exciting debut \" he had ever seen . Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win over Portsmouth on 1 November . Three more league goals followed in the second half of the campaign , the last of which came against Aston Villa on the final day of the season , a match in which he also received the first red card of his career . Ronaldo ended his first season in English football by scoring the opening goal in United \\'s 3–0 win over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final , earning his first trophy . BBC pundit Alan Hansen described him as the star of the final . The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his \" elaborate \" step-overs in trying to beat opponents , but teammate Gary Neville said he was \" not a show pony , but the real thing \" , and predicted he would become a world-class player . Ronaldo scored United \\'s 1,000th Premier League goal on 29 October 2004 , their only goal in a 4–1 loss to Middlesbrough . A few weeks later , he signed a new contract with the club that extended his previous deal by two years to 2010 . At the start of 2005 , Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the 2004–05 season , producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice against rivals Arsenal . He played the full 120 minutes of the 2005 FA Cup Final against Arsenal , which ended in a goalless draw ; although Ronaldo scored his attempt in the penalty shoot-out , United lost 5–4 . Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football , the Football League Cup , after scoring the third goal in United \\'s 4–0 final win over Wigan Athletic . During his third season in England , Ronaldo was involved in several incidents . He had a one-match ban imposed on him by UEFA for a \" one-fingered gesture \" towards Benfica fans , and was sent off in the Manchester derby ( a 3–1 defeat ) for kicking Manchester City \\'s former United player Andy Cole . Ronaldo clashed with a teammate , striker Ruud van Nistelrooy , who took offence at the winger \\'s showboating style of play . Following the 2006 FIFA World Cup , in which he was involved in an incident where club teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off , Ronaldo publicly asked for a transfer , lamenting the lack of support he felt he had received from the club over the incident . United denied the possibility of him leaving the club . Although his World Cup altercation with Rooney resulted in Ronaldo being booed throughout the 2006–07 season , it proved to be his breakout year , as he broke the 20-goal barrier for the first time and won his first Premier League title . An important factor in this success was his one-to-one training by first-team coach René Meulensteen , who taught him to make himself more unpredictable , improve his teamwork , call for the ball and capitalise on goalscoring opportunities rather than waiting for the chance to score the aesthetically pleasing goals for which he was already known . He scored three consecutive braces at the end of December , against Aston Villa ( a win that put United on top of the league ) , Wigan and Reading . Ronaldo was named the Premier League Player of the Month in November and December , becoming only the third player to receive consecutive honours . 2007–2008 : Collective and individual success At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League , Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition , scoring twice in a 7–1 win over Roma . He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan , which ended in a 3–2 win , but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro . He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final , but the final against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat . Ronaldo scored the only goal in the Manchester derby on 5 May ( his 50th goal for the club ) , as United won their first league title in four years . As a result of his performances , he amassed a host of personal awards for the season . He won the Professional Footballers \\' Association \\'s Player \\'s Player , Fans \\' Player and Young Player of the Year awards , as well as the Football Writers \\' Association \\'s Footballer of the Year award , becoming the first player to win all four main PFA and FWA honours . His wages were concurrently upgraded to £120,000 a week as part of a five-year contract extension . Ronaldo was named runner-up to Kaká for the 2007 Ballon d\\'Or , and came third , behind Kaká and Lionel Messi , in the running for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year award . Ronaldo scored his first and only hat-trick for United in a 6–0 win against Newcastle United on 12 January 2008 , which put United top of the league table . On 19 March , he captained United for the first time in a home win over Bolton and scored both goals in a 2–0 win . His second goal was his 33rd of the campaign , which bettered George Best \\'s total of 32 goals in the 1967–68 season , thus setting the club \\'s new single-season record by a midfielder . His 31 league goals earned him the Premier League Golden Boot , as well as the European Golden Shoe , which made him the first winger to win the latter award . He additionally received the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year awards for the second consecutive season . In the knockout stage of the Champions League , Ronaldo scored the decisive goal against Lyon , which helped United advance to the quarter-finals 2–1 on aggregate ; while playing as a striker , he scored with a header in the 3–0 aggregate win over Roma . United reached the final against Chelsea in Moscow , where , despite his opening goal being negated by an equaliser and his penalty kick being saved in the shoot-out , United emerged victorious . As the Champions League top scorer , Ronaldo was named the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year . Ronaldo scored a total of 42 goals in all competitions during the 2007–08 season , his most prolific campaign during his time in England . He missed three matches after headbutting a Portsmouth player at the start of the season , an experience he said taught him not to let opponents provoke him . As rumours circulated of Ronaldo \\'s interest in moving to Real Madrid , United filed a tampering complaint with governing body FIFA over Madrid \\'s alleged pursuit of their player , but they declined to take action . FIFA president Sepp Blatter asserted that the player should be allowed to leave his club , describing the situation as \" modern slavery \" . Despite Ronaldo publicly agreeing with Blatter , he remained at United for another year . 2008–2009 : Final season and continued success Ahead of the 2008–09 season , on 7 July , Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery , which kept him out of action for 10 weeks . Following his return , he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November , which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time . At the close of 2008 , Ronaldo helped United win the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan , assisting the final-winning goal against Liga de Quito and winning the Silver Ball in the process . With his 2008 Ballon d\\'Or and 2008 FIFA World Player of the Year , Ronaldo became United \\'s first Ballon d\\'Or winner since Best in 1968 , and the first Premier League player to be named the FIFA World Player of the Year . His match-winning goal in the second leg against Porto , a 40-yard strike , earned him the inaugural FIFA Puskás Award , presented by FIFA in recognition of the best goal of the year ; he later called it the best goal he had ever scored . United advanced to the final in Rome , where he made little impact in United \\'s 2–0 defeat to Barcelona . Ronaldo ended his time in England with nine trophies , as United claimed their third successive league title and a Football League Cup . He finished the campaign with 26 goals in all competitions , 16 goals fewer than the previous season , in four more appearances . His final goal for United came on 10 May 2009 with a free kick in the Manchester derby at Old Trafford . Real Madrid Ahead of the 2009–10 season , Ronaldo joined Real Madrid for a world record transfer fee at the time , of £80 million ( €94 million ) . His contract , which ran until 2015 , was worth €11 million per year and contained a €1 billion buy-out clause . At least 80,000 fans attended his presentation at the Santiago Bernabéu , surpassing the 25-year record of 75,000 fans who had welcomed Diego Maradona at Napoli . Since club captain Raúl already wore the number 7 ( the number Ronaldo wore at United ) , Ronaldo received the number 9 shirt , which was presented to him by former Madrid player Alfredo Di Stéfano . 2009–2013 : World record transfer and La Liga championship Ronaldo made his La Liga debut against Deportivo La Coruña on 29 August and scored from the penalty spot in Madrid \\'s 3–2 home win . He scored in each of his first four league games , the first Madrid player to do so . His first Champions League goals for the club followed with two free kicks in the first group match against Zürich . His strong start to the season was interrupted when he suffered an ankle injury in October while on international duty , which kept him sidelined for seven weeks . A week after his return , he received his first red card in Spain in a match against Almería . Midway through the season , Ronaldo finished second in the 2009 Ballon d\\'Or and the 2009 FIFA World Player of the Year awards , behind Messi of Barcelona , Madrid \\'s rivals . He finished the season with 33 goals in all competitions , including a hat-trick in a 4–1 win against Mallorca on 5 May 2010 , his first in La Liga . His first season at Madrid ended trophyless . Following Raúl \\'s departure , Ronaldo was given the number 7 shirt for Madrid before the 2010–11 season . His subsequent return to his Ballon d\\'Or-winning form was epitomised when , for the first time in his career , he scored four goals in a single match during a 6–1 rout against Racing Santander on 23 October . His haul concluded a run of scoring in six consecutive matches for club and country , totalling 11 goals , the most he had scored in a single month . Ronaldo subsequently scored further hat-tricks against Athletic Bilbao , Levante , Villarreal and Málaga . Despite his performances , he did not make the top three in the inaugural 2010 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or . During a historic series of four Clásicos against rivals Barcelona in April 2011 , Ronaldo scored twice to equal his personal record of 42 goals in all competitions . Though he failed to score in either leg of the Champions League semi-finals as Madrid were eliminated , he equalised from the penalty spot in the return league game and scored the match-winning goal in the 103rd minute of the 2011 Copa del Rey Final , winning his first trophy in Spain . His two goals in the last match of the season against Almería made him the first player in La Liga to score 40 goals . In addition to the Pichichi Trophy , Ronaldo won the European Golden Shoe for a second time , becoming the first player to win the award in different leagues . During the following season , Ronaldo achieved a new personal best of 60 goals in all competitions . He finished as runner-up to Messi for the 2011 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or , after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza , Rayo Vallecano , Málaga , Osasuna and Sevilla , the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season \\'s midway point . Ronaldo found greater team success in the league , helping Madrid win their first league title in four years with a record 100 points . Following a hat-trick against Levante as Madrid further increased their lead over Barcelona , he scored his 100th league goal for Madrid in a 5–1 win over Real Sociedad on 24 March 2012 , a milestone he reached in just 92 matches across three seasons , breaking the previous club record held by Ferenc Puskás . Another hat-trick in the Madrid derby against Atlético Madrid brought his total to 40 league goals , equalling his record of the previous season . His final league goal of the season , against Mallorca , took his total to 46 goals , four short of the new record set by Messi , though he became the first player to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single La Liga season . Ronaldo began the 2012–13 season by lifting the 2012 Supercopa de España , his third trophy in Spain . With a goal in each leg , he helped Madrid win the Spanish Super Cup on away goals following a 4–4 aggregate draw against Barcelona . Although Ronaldo publicly commented that he was unhappy with a \" professional issue \" within the club , prompted by his refusal to celebrate his 150th goal for Madrid , his goalscoring rate did not suffer . After netting a hat-trick , including two penalties , against Deportivo , he scored his first hat-trick in the Champions League in a 4–1 win over Ajax . Four days later , he became the first player to score in six successive Clásicos when he hit a brace in a 2–2 draw at Camp Nou . His performances again saw Ronaldo voted second in the running for the 2012 FIFA Ballon d\\'Or , behind four-time winner Messi . 2013–2015 : Consecutive FIFA Ballon d\\'Or wins and La Décima Following the 2012–13 winter break , Ronaldo captained Madrid for the first time in an official match , scoring twice to lift 10-man Madrid to a 4–3 win over Sociedad on 6 January . He subsequently became the first non-Spanish player in 60 years to captain Madrid in El Clasico on 30 January , a match which also marked his 500th club appearance . Three days prior , he had scored his 300th club goal as part of a perfect hat-trick against Getafe . He scored his 200th goal for Madrid on 8 May in a 6–2 win against Málaga , reaching the landmark in 197 games . He helped Madrid reach the 2013 Copa del Rey Final by scoring twice in El Clásico , which marked the sixth successive match at Camp Nou in which he had scored , a club record . In the final , he headed the opening goal of an eventual 2–1 defeat to Atlético , but was shown a red card for violent conduct . In the first knockout round of the Champions League , Ronaldo faced his former club Manchester United for the first time . After scoring the equaliser in a 1–1 draw at home , he scored the winning goal in a 2–1 win on his first return to Old Trafford . He did not celebrate scoring against his former club as a mark of respect . After scoring three goals against Galatasaray in the quarters , he scored Madrid \\'s only goal in the 4–1 away defeat to Borussia Dortmund in the semi-finals and Real were eliminated at the semi-final stage for the third consecutive year despite a 2–0 win in the second leg . At the start of the 2013–14 season , Ronaldo signed a new contract that extended his stay by three years to 2018 , with a salary of €17 million net , making him briefly the highest-paid player in football . He was joined at the club by winger Gareth Bale , whose world record transfer fee of €100 million surpassed the fee Madrid had paid for Ronaldo four years prior . Together with striker Karim Benzema , they formed an attacking trio popularly dubbed \" BBC \" , an acronym of Bale , Benzema and Cristiano , and a play on the name of the British public service broadcaster , the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) .

Concurrently with his individual achievements , Ronaldo enjoyed his greatest team success in Spain to date , as he helped Madrid win La Décima , their tenth European Cup . His goal in a 3–0 home win over Dortmund ( his 100th Champions League match ) took his total for the season to 14 goals , equalling the record Messi had set two years before . After hitting a brace in a 4–0 defeat of Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena , he scored from the penalty spot in the 120th minute of the 4–1 final win over Atlético , becoming the first player to score in two European Cup finals for two different winning teams . His overall performance in the final was subdued as a result of patellar tendinitis and related hamstring problems , which had plagued him in the last months of the campaign . Ronaldo played the final against medical advice , later commenting : \" In your life you do not win without sacrifices and you must take risks \" . As the competition \\'s top goalscorer for the third time , with a record 17 goals , he was named the UEFA Best Player in Europe . In the Copa del Rey , Ronaldo helped Madrid reach the final by scoring two penalties against Atlético at the Vicente Calderón , the first of which meant he had now scored in every single minute of a 90-minute football match . His continued issues with his knee and thigh caused him to miss the final , where Madrid defeated Barcelona 2–1 to claim the trophy .

Among his haul was his 400th career goal , in 653 appearances for club and country , which came with a brace against Celta Vigo on 6 January ; he dedicated his goals to compatriot Eusébio , who had died two days before .

In Portugal \\'s an infamously dirty round of 16 match against the Netherlands , Ronaldo was forced off injured in the first half after a tackle from Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz . Following Portugal \\'s 1–0 win , Ronaldo accused Boulahrouz of intentionally trying to injure him , although he recovered in time to play in the next game . In Portugal \\'s quarter-final against England , Ronaldo \\'s Manchester United teammate Wayne Rooney was sent off for stamping on Portugal defender Ricardo Carvalho . Although the referee later clarified that the red card was only due to Rooney \\'s infraction , the English media speculated that Ronaldo had influenced his decision by aggressively complaining , after which he was seen in replays winking at Portugal \\'s bench following Rooney \\'s dismissal . Ronaldo went on to score the vital winning penalty during the shoot-out which sent Portugal into the semi-finals . Ronaldo was subsequently booed during their 1–0 semi-final defeat to France . FIFA \\'s Technical Study Group overlooked him for the tournament \\'s Best Young Player award and handed it to Germany \\'s Lukas Podolski , citing his behaviour as a factor in the decision . Following the 2006 World Cup , Ronaldo would go on to represent Portugal in four qualifying games for Euro 2008 , scoring two goals in the process . 2007–2012 : Assuming the captaincy One day after his 22nd birthday , Ronaldo captained Portugal for the first time in a friendly game against Brazil on 6 February 2007 , as requested by Portuguese Football Federation ( FPF ) president Carlos Silva , who had died two days earlier .

A qualifying match on 17 October 2012 , a 1–1 draw against Northern Ireland , earned him his 100th cap . His first international hat-trick also came against Northern Ireland , when he scored three times in a 15-minute spell of a 4–2 qualifying win on 6 September 2013 . After Portugal failed to qualify during the regular campaign , Ronaldo scored all four of the team \\'s goals in the play-offs against Sweden , billed as a battle between Ronaldo and Zlatan Ibrahimović , which ensured their place at the tournament .

Ronaldo subsequently scored twice in a 5–1 friendly win over Cameroon on 5 March 2014 to become his country \\'s all-time top scorer . Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury , potentially risking his career . Ronaldo later commented : \" If we had two or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable . But we do n\\'t . \" Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness , being forced to abort practice twice , Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany , although he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat . After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States , he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 win over Ghana .

At the start of the tournament , Ronaldo failed to convert his chances in Portugal \\'s draws against Iceland and Austria , despite taking 20 shots on goal . In the latter match , he overtook Figo as Portugal \\'s most capped player with his 128th international appearance , which ended scoreless after he missed a penalty in the second half .

Although placed third in their group behind Hungary and Iceland , his team qualified for the knockout round as a result of the competition \\'s newly expanded format , despite not winning any of their games . In Portugal \\'s first knockout match , Ronaldo \\'s only attempt on goal was parried by Croatia \\'s goalkeeper Danijel Subašić into the path of Ricardo Quaresma , whose finish then secured a 1–0 win late in extra time . After his team progressed past Poland on penalties , with Ronaldo scoring Portugal \\'s opening penalty , he became the first player to participate in three European Championship semi-finals ; he scored the opener in a 2–0 win against Wales , equalling Michel Platini as the competition \\'s all-time top scorer with nine goals . In the final against hosts France , Ronaldo was forced off after just 25 minutes following a challenge from Dimitri Payet , despite multiple treatments and attempts to play on , he was stretchered off the pitch and replaced by Quaresma .

Player profile Style of play A versatile attacker , Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch , and , while ostensibly right-footed , is very strong with both feet . He ranks among the world \\'s fastest footballers , both with and without the ball . Tactically , Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career . While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United , he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield , where he regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area . In this position , he was able to use his pace and acceleration , agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations . Ronaldo became noted for his dribbling and flair , often displaying an array of tricks and feints , such as the step overs and so-called \\'chops \\' that became his trademark ; he has also been known to use the flip–flap . As Ronaldo matured , he underwent a major physical transformation , developing a muscular body type that allowed him to retain possession of the ball under pressure , and strong legs that enabled an outstanding jumping ability . His strength and jumping ability , combined with his elevation , heading accuracy and height of , give him an edge in winning aerial duels . These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area ; consequently , many of his goals have been headers . Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate , his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks . He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team , often dropping deep to pick up the ball , participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates , courtesy of his vision and passing ability . In his final seasons at United , Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role , functioning both as a striker and as a supporting forward , or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion . He developed into a prolific goalscorer , capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot , courtesy of his striking ability . An accurate penalty kick taker , he also became a set piece specialist , renowned for his powerful , bending free kicks . When taking free kicks , Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique , which was developed by Juninho Pernambucano . He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball , which involves him standing with his legs far apart . Regarding Ronaldo \\'s unique style of taking free kicks , former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented : \" People used to put the ball down , walk away , run up and hit it . He brought in a more dynamic showmanship . He places the ball down , the concentration level is high , he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot . He is the ultimate showman . He has that slight arrogance . When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs , he is saying \\'All eyes on me \\' and this is going in . He understands the marketing side of it . The way he struts up and places it ; the world is watching him . \" At Real Madrid , Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role , while his creative and defensive duties became more limited , although not entirely diminished . Initially deployed as a centre forward by managers Manuel Pellegrini and José Mourinho , he was later moved back onto the left wing , though in a free tactical role ; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score , or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit . Madrid \\'s counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player , as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats . While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring , Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role . This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a \" false \" , \" attacking \" , or \" goalscoring winger \" , as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area , despite actually playing on the left flank . From 2013 onwards , under manager Carlo Ancelotti , he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement , completing fewer dribbles and passes per game , and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring . Since 2017 , Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under manager Zinedine Zidane , a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record ; in this position , he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball , positional sense , link-up play and finishing , as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers , find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities . In his first season at Juventus , Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager Massimiliano Allegri , depending on whom he was partnered with . While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid , at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus , either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing , in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation , in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić . In this role , he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball , and be more involved in the build-up of plays ; as such , aside from scoring goals himself , he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid . Off the ball , he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box , or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates \\' crosses . On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2 , 4–4–2 , or 3–5–2 formation . He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under manager Maurizio Sarri . Reception Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation , alongside Lionel Messi . Winning his first Ballon d\\'Or in 2008 by a record-high vote count at age 23 , over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history . Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring , he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer , especially in important and high-pressured situations . Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic , elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch , as well being regarded as a natural leader . On his longevity and \" extraordinary commitment to physical preparation \" , Adam Bate of Sky Sports said : \" Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo \\'s focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game . \" While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals , former Brazil international Ronaldo praised Cristiano \\'s approach to training , arguing that \" there are so few players who take care of their body like he does . I trained because I had to , he does it because he loves it . \" His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such as Pelé and Diego Maradona once retiring . He is credited , along with his compatriot , coach José Mourinho , with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in and . At times , he has been criticised for simulating when tackled . He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson , teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player . Jonathan Wilson of The Guardian opined that Ronaldo had made Juventus , who he joined aged 33 in 2018 , weaker , due to \" his relative immobility \" in his mid-30s , even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high . During his career , Ronaldo has also been described as having an \" arrogant image \" on the pitch , with Ronaldo stating that he had become a \" victim \" because of how he was portrayed in the media . He is often seen moaning , gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory , with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance . His managers , teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him . Goal celebrations Ronaldo has adopted several goal celebrations throughout his career , including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media , when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin . After scoring a goal , he usually celebrates with a \" storming jump \" and \" turn \" , before \" landing in spread-eagled fashion \" into his \" signature power stance \" , while usually simultaneously exclaiming \" Sí \" ( Spanish and Italian for \" yes \" ) . This trademark celebration has been dubbed the \" Sii \" in the media . Comparisons to Lionel Messi Both players have scored in multiple UEFA Champions League finals and have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season . Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game . It has been compared to several sports rivalries , among them the Muhammad Ali–Joe Frazier rivalry in boxing , the Borg–McEnroe rivalry in tennis and the Senna–Prost rivalry from Formula One motor racing . Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two , Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players , as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff , while Messi is portrayed as a shy , humble character . In a 2012 interview , Ronaldo commented on the rivalry , saying : \" I think we push each other sometimes in the competition , this is why the competition is so high . \" Alex Ferguson , Ronaldo \\'s manager during his time at Manchester United , opined : \" I do n\\'t think the rivalry against each other bothers them . I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best . \" Messi himself denied any rivalry , saying that it was \" only the media , the press , who wants us to be at loggerheads but I \\'ve never fought with Cristiano . \" Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level , Ronaldo commented : \" We do n\\'t have a relationship outside the world of football , just as we do n\\'t with a lot of other players . \" Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together , stating : \" We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit , because it \\'s a good thing . \" Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid , the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world \\'s biggest club game , El Clásico , which is among the world \\'s most viewed annual sporting events . In a debate at Oxford Union in October 2013 , when asked whether FIFA president Sepp Blatter preferred Messi or Ronaldo , Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo , claiming \" one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other . \" Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology . In response to Blatter \\'s \" commander \" on the pitch comment , Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla . In August 2019 , Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of the UEFA Men \\'s Player of the Year , with Ronaldo stating : \" I pushed him and he pushed me as well . So it \\'s good to be part of the history of football . \" Outside football As his reputation grew from his time at Manchester United , Ronaldo has signed many sponsorship deals for consumer products , including sportswear , football boots ; since November 2012 , Ronaldo has worn the Nike Mercurial Vapor personalized CR7 edition , soft drinks , clothing , automotive lubricants , financial services , electronics , and video games .

In June 2010 , during the build-up to the World Cup , Ronaldo became the fourth footballer ( after Steven Gerrard , Pelé , and David Beckham ) to be represented as a waxwork at Madame Tussauds London .

In January 2015 , Ronaldo announced his five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk had ended . Ronaldo then became father to twins , daughter Eva and son Mateo , born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy . He is in a relationship with Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez , a former shop assistant , who gave birth to their daughter Alana Martina , on 12 November 2017 . In October 2021 , Ronaldo announced the family would be expecting a second pair of twins . Ronaldo \\'s father , José , died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20 . Ronaldo said that he does not drink alcohol , and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008 . He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow . His mother Dolores was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 but eventually recovered . Philanthropy Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career . Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed . Following this , Ronaldo visited Aceh , Indonesia , to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction . After accepting undisclosed damages from a libel case against The Sun newspaper in 2008 , Ronaldo donated the damages to a charity in Madeira . In 2009 , Ronaldo donated £100,000 to the hospital that saved his mother \\'s life in Madeira following her battle with cancer , so that they could build a cancer centre on the island . In support of the victims of the 2010 Madeira flood , Ronaldo pledged to play in a charity match in Madeira between Primeira Liga club Porto and players from Madeiran-based clubs Marítimo and Nacional . In 2012 , Ronaldo and his agent paid for specialist treatment for a nine-year-old Canarian boy with apparently terminal cancer . In December 2012 , Ronaldo joined FIFA \\'s \" 11 for Health \" programme to raise awareness amongst kids of how to steer clear of conditions including drug addiction , HIV , malaria , and obesity . In January 2013 , Ronaldo became Save the Children \\'s new Global Artist Ambassador , in which he hopes to help fight child hunger and obesity . In March 2013 , Ronaldo agreed to be the ambassador for The Mangrove Care Forum in Indonesia , an organisation aiming to raise awareness of mangrove conservation . Ronaldo was named the world \\'s most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people . In June 2016 , Ronaldo donated the entirety of his €600,000 Champions League bonus after Real Madrid won the Champions League . In August , Ronaldo launched CR7Selfie , a selfie app for charity to help Save the Children that lets participants take a selfie with him in one of several different outfits and poses . Legal issues In July 2017 , Ronaldo was charged with fraudulently evading almost €15 million in tax between 2011 and 2014 , a claim he denied at the time . In June 2018 , Ronaldo was given a two-year suspended jail sentence and fined €18.8 million , later reduced to €16.8 million after reaching a deal with Spanish authorities . The sentence can be served under probation , without any jail time , so long as he does not re-offend . Ronaldo and another man were investigated by the British Crown Prosecution Service after a 2005 rape allegation was brought forward by two women . Within days , the two women withdrew their allegation and Scotland Yard later issued a statement declaring there was not enough evidence for a prosecution . In April 2017 , it was reported that Ronaldo was being investigated by the Las Vegas Police Department for an allegation by a woman that he had raped her in 2009 . Documents , confirmed by Ronaldo \\'s lawyers , state that Ronaldo paid a woman US $ 375,000 in a non-disclosure settlement . Ronaldo and his lawyers issued a lengthy statement denying all accusations , describing them as an \" intentional defamation campaign \" with parts significantly \" altered and/or completely fabricated \" , a claim which Der Spiegel categorically denied . In July 2019 , Las Vegas prosecutors said they would not charge Ronaldo over allegations of rape ; the statement added : \" Based upon a review of information at this time , the allegations of sexual assault against Cristiano Ronaldo can not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt . \" The Daily Mirror , citing court documents , reported in 2021 that the woman is seeking £56 million in damages from Ronaldo in a civil lawsuit .

It is closely associated with the neighbouring Mandé , Senoufo and Gur peoples of West Africa , particularly the Guinean branch of the Mandinka ethnic group , but is now found across West Africa from Guinea to Mali . Its common name , balafon , is likely a European coinage combining its Mandinka name bala with the word fôn \\'to speak \\' or the Greek root phono . History Believed to have been developed independently of the Southern African and South American instrument now called the marimba , oral histories of the balafon date it to at least the rise of the Mali Empire in the 12th century CE . Balafon is a Manding name , but variations exist across West Africa , including the balangi in Sierra Leone and the gyil of the Dagara , Lobi and Gurunsi from Ghana , Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast . Similar instruments are played in parts of Central Africa , with the ancient Kingdom of Kongo denoting the instrument as palaku . Records of the balafon go back to at least the 12th century CE . In 1352 CE , Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta reported the existence of the ngoni and balafon at the court of Malian ruler Mansa Suleyman . European visitors to West Africa described balafons in the 17th century largely identical to the modern instrument . The Atlantic Slave Trade brought some balafon players to the Americas . The Virginia Gazette records African-Americans playing a barrafoo in 1776 , which appears to be a balafon . Other North American references to these instruments die out by the mid-19th century . The balafon has seen a resurgence since the 1980s in the growth of African Roots Music and World Music . Most famous of these exponents is the Rail Band , led by Salif Keita . Even when not still played , its distinctive sound and traditional style has been exported to western instruments . Maninka from eastern Guinea play a type of guitar music that adapts balafon playing style to the imported instrument . Etymology In the Malinké language balafon is a compound of two words : balan is the name of the instrument and fô is the verb to play . Balafon therefore is really the act of playing the bala . Bala still is used as the name of a large bass balafon in the region of Kolokani and Bobo Dioulasso . These bala have especially long keys and huge calabashes for amplification . Balani is then used as the name of the high pitched , small balafon with small calabashes and short ( 3 to 4 cm long ) keys . The balani is carried with a strap and usually has 21 keys , while the number of keys on a bala vary with region . Construction A balafon can be either fixed-key ( where the keys are strung over a fixed frame , usually with calabash resonators underneath ) or free-key ( where the keys are placed independently on any padded surface ) . The balafon usually has 17–21 keys , tuned to a tetratonic , pentatonic or heptatonic scale , depending on the culture of the musician . The balafon is generally capable of producing 18 to 21 notes , though some are built to produce many fewer notes ( 16 , 12 , 8 or even 6 and 7 ) . Balafon keys are traditionally made from béné wood , dried slowly over a low flame , and then tuned by shaving off bits of wood from the underside of the keys . Wood is taken off the middle to flatten the key or the end to sharpen it . In a fixed-key balafon , the keys are suspended by leather straps just above a wooden frame , under which are hung graduated-size calabash gourd resonators . A small hole in each gourd is covered with a membrane traditionally of thin spider\\'s-egg sac filaments ( nowadays more usually of cigarette paper or thin plastic film ) to produce the characteristic nasal-buzz timbre of the instrument , which is usually played with two gum-rubber-wound mallets while seated on a low stool ( or while standing using a shoulder or waist sling hooked to its frame ) . Regional traditions As the balafon cultures vary across West Africa , so does the approach to the instrument itself . In many areas the balafon is played alone in a ritual context , in others as part of an ensemble . In Guinea and Mali , the balafon is often part of an ensemble of three , pitched low , medium and high . In Cameroon , six balafon of varying size perform together in an orchestra , called a komenchang . An Igbo variation exists with only one large tuned key for each player . And while in most cases a single player hits multiple keys with two mallets , some traditions place two or more players at each keyboard . The Susu and Malinké people of Guinea are closely identified with the balafon , as are the other Manding peoples of Mali , Senegal , and the Gambia . Cameroon , Chad , and even the nations of the Congo Basin have long balafon traditions . Often , balafon players will wear belled bracelets on each wrist , accentuating the sound of the keys . In some cultures the balafon was ( and in some still is ) a sacred instrument , playable only by trained religious caste members and only at ritual events such as festivals , royal , funerial , or marriage celebrations . Here the balafon is kept in a temple storehouse , and can only be removed and played after undergoing purification rites . Specific instruments may be built to be only played for specific rituals and repertoires . Young adepts are trained not on the sacred instrument , but on free-key pit balafons . Gyil The gyil ( or ) is the name of a buzzing pentatonic balafon common to the Gur-speaking populations in northern Ghana , Burkina Faso , southeastern Mali and northern Ivory Coast in West Africa . Among Mande populations in Ghana like the Ligbi ( Numu ) , Bissa and Dyula , the same instrument is known as bala . The gyil is the primary traditional instrument of the Dagara people of northern Ghana and Burkina Faso , and of the Lobi of Ghana , southern Burkina Faso , and Ivory Coast . The gyil is usually played in pairs , accompanied by a calabash gourd drum called a kuor . It can also be played by one person with the drum and the stick part as accompaniment , or by a soloist . Gyil duets are the traditional music of Dagara funerals . The instrument is generally played by men , who learn to play while young ; however , there is no restriction on gender . It is also played by the Gurunsi people of the Upper East Region of Ghana , as well as neighbouring Gurunsi populations across the border in south and central Burkina Faso . A dance related to the gyil is the Bewaa . The gyil \\'s design is similar to the balaba or balafon used by the Mande-speaking Bambara , Dyula and Sosso peoples further west in southern Mali and western Burkina Faso , as well as the Senoufo people of Sikasso , a region that shares many musical traditions with those of northern Ivory Coast and Ghana . It is made with 14 wooden keys of an African hardwood called liga attached to a wooden frame , below which hang calabash gourds . Spider web silk covers small holes in the gourds to produce a buzzing sound and antelope sinew and leather are used for the fastenings . The instrument is played with rubber-headed wooden mallets . Cameroon During the 1950s , bars sprang up across Cameroon \\'s capital to accommodate an influx of new inhabitants , and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism . Balafon orchestras , consisting of 3–5 balafons and various percussion instruments became common in these bars . Some of these orchestras , such as Richard Band de Zoetele , became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite . The middle of the 20th century saw the popularisation of a native folk music called bikutsi . Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles , drums and balafon . Sung by women , bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems . In a popularised form , bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s . Anne-Marie Nzie was perhaps the most important of the early innovators . The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band , Los Camaroes , who added electric guitars and other new elements . Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 50s in Yaoundé \\'s bar scene , but the audience demanded modernity and the popular style at the time was unable to cope . Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea , as well as Cuban and Zairean rumba . Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper , thus giving the instrument a damper tone that emitted a \" thudding \" sound similar to the balafon . Guinea The balafon , kora ( lute-harp ) , and the ngoni ( the ancestor of the banjo ) are the three instruments most associated with griot bardic traditions of West Africa . Each is more closely associated with specific areas , communities , and traditions , though all are played together in ensembles throughout the region . Guinea has been the historic heartland of solo balafon . As griot culture is a hereditary caste , the Kouyaté family has been called the keepers of the balafon , and twentieth century members of this family have helped introduce it throughout the world . The Sosso Bala The : Fr : Sosso Bala is a balafon , currently kept in the town of Niagassola , Guinea that is reputed to be the original balafon , constructed over 800 years ago . The Epic of Sundiata , a story of the formation of the Mali Empire , tells that a griot ( praise-singer ) named Bala Faséké Kouyaté convinced Sosso king Sumanguru Kante to employ him after sneaking into Sumanguru \\'s palace and playing the sacred instrument . Sundiata Keita , founder of the Mali Empire overthrew Sumanguru , seized the balafon , and made the griot Faséké its guardian . This honor is said to have passed down through his family , the Kouyatés , and conveys upon them mastership of the balafon to this day . Regardless of the truth of this story , the Sosso Bala is an instrument of great age , and was named by UNESCO as one of the Nineteen Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2001 . Senegal The title of the Senegalese National Anthem is \" Pincez Tous vos Koras , Frappez les Balafons \" ( Everyone strum your koras , strike the balafons ) . Mali A modern festival devoted to the balafon , the Triangle du balafon , now takes place annually at Sikasso in Mali . Famous players and ensembles Famous balafon players have included : Madou Kone , Balafon Master from Burkina Faso , living in Vienna , Austria Richard Bona , Cameroonian jazz musician Abdou Karim Diabate \" Tunkaraba \" King of Balafon , from the village of Tabatto , Guinea-Bissau Djiby Diabaté Kélétigui Diabaté , playing for Habib Koité \\'s Bamada group Mamadou Diabate , Knight of the National Order of Burkina Faso ( 2016 ) , Winner of the \" Grand Prix \" & \" Prix de la Virtuosite de Festival Triangle du Balafon \" in Mali ( 2012 ) , Winner of the Austrian World Music Award ( 2011 ) Lassana Diabaté , Malian musician known for work with Toumani Diabaté \\'s Symmetric Orchestra and Afrocubism Modibo Diabaté , from Mali Zerika Djabate , Bissau-Guinean musician Djiguiya , percussion band from Burkina Faso Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo Les Freres Coulibaly , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Stefon Harris , American jazz musician Dominic Howard of Muse used a balafon on the band \\'s second album , Origin of Symmetry Mory Kanté , early in his career Aly Keita , Aly Keita and the Magic Balaphone , Malian balafon player Gertrude Kilian , DVD \" The Balafon with Aly Keita & Gert Kilian \" , \" Balafon Beat \" / Verlag Zimmermann Lawrence Killian , American jazz musician Mahama Konaté of John Cena , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Balla Kouyate , from Mali/Guinea , whose father , Sekou \" Filani \" Kouyaté , is the current guardian of the Sosso Bala Mamadi Kouyate , from Mali/Guinea , ( Germany since 2015 ) , whose grandfather Sékou \" Filani \" Kouyaté , is the current guardian of the Sosso Bala El Hadj Djeli Sory Kouyaté N\\'Faly Kouyate of the Afro Celt Sound System Adam Malik , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Dave Mann , jazz percussionist , played with the Dave Brubeck Group Neba Solo ( Senufo balafon group , led by Souleymane Traoré ) from Sikasso Mama Ohandja , Cameroonian composer and performer to his country Qasim , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Pharoah Sanders , American jazz musician Saramaya , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Raheel Sharif , British band leader originally from Senegal Bill Summers , American jazz musician , performing with Quincy Jones , Herbie Hancock , and Los Hombres Calientes Lonnie Liston Smith , American jazz musician Rokia Traoré , Malian singer , guitarist , and band leader Le Troupe Saaba , Burkina-based balafon ensemble Momo Werner Wevers , German balafon player , plays solo and with the \" Ensemble M.Pahiya \" ( balafon and classical guitar ) N\\'Camara Abou Sylla ( Guinea ; Les Ballets Africains ) See also Music of Guinea Music of Mali Marimba , covers the modern instrument which developed independently in both South America and southern Africa .

Their advanced position and limited defensive responsibilities mean forwards normally score more goals on behalf of their team than other players . Modern team formations generally include one to three forwards ; for example , the common 4–2–3–1 formation includes one forward . Unconventional formations may include more than three forwards , or none . Centre-forward The traditional role of a centre-forward is to score the majority of goals on behalf of the team . If they are tall and physical players , with good heading ability , the player may also be used to get onto the end of crosses , win long balls , or receive passes and retain possession of the ball with their back to goal as teammates advance , in order to provide depth for their team or help teammates score by providing a pass ( \\'through ball \\' into the box ) , the latter variation usually requiring quicker pace and good movement , in addition to finishing ability . Most modern centre-forwards operate in front of the second strikers or central attacking midfielders , and do the majority of the ball handling outside the box . The present role of centre-forward is sometimes interchangeable with that of an attacking midfielder or second striker , however , especially in the 4–3–1–2 or 4–1–2–1–2 formations . The term centre-forward is taken from the earlier football playing formations , such as the 2–3–5 , in which there were five forward players : two outside forwards , two inside forwards , and one centre-forward . The term \" target forward \" is often used interchangeably with that of a centre-forward , but usually describes a particular type of striker , who is usually a tall and physically strong player , who is adept at heading the ball ; their main role is to win high balls in the air , hold up the ball , and create chances for other members of the team , in addition to possibly scoring many goals themselves . However , the two terms are not necessarily synonymous , with the target forward having developed into a more specialised role , while the centre-forward description is more broad , encompassing many types of forwards . When numbers were introduced in the 1933 English FA Cup final , one of the two centre-forwards that day wore the number 9 – Everton \\'s Dixie Dean , a strong , powerful forward who had set the record for the most goals scored in a season in English football during the 1927–28 season . The number would then become synonymous with the centre-forward position ( only worn that day because one team was numbered 1–11 whilst the other was numbered 12–22 ) . Striker The role of a striker is rather different from that of a traditional centre-forward , although the terms centre-forward and striker are used interchangeably at times , as both play further up the field than other players , while tall , heavy and technical players , like Zlatan Ibrahimović , and Edin Džeko , have qualities which are suited to both positions . Like the centre-forward , the traditional role of a striker is to score goals ; strikers are therefore known for their ability to peel off defenders and to run into space via the blind side of the defender and to receive the ball in a good goalscoring position , as typified by Ronaldo and Thierry Henry . They are typically fast players with good ball control and dribbling abilities . Shorter statured , More agile strikers like Michael Owen , Kylian Mbappé , Dries Mertens , Sergio Agüero , and Paulo Dybala have an advantage over taller defenders due to their short bursts of speed . Good strikers should be able to shoot confidently with either foot , possess great power and accuracy , and have the ability to link-up with teammates and pass the ball under pressure in breakaway situations . While many strikers wear the number 9 shirt , such as Alan Shearer , an out and out striker , the position , to a lesser degree , is also associated with the number 10 , which is frequently worn by more creative deep-lying forwards such as Pelé , and occasionally with numbers 7 and 11 , which are often associated with wingers . Second striker Deep-lying forwards have a long history in the game , but the terminology to describe their playing activity has varied over the years . Originally such players were termed inside forwards , creative or deep-lying centre-forwards ( \" sub forwards \" ) . More recently , two more variations of this old type of player have developed : the second , or shadow , or support , or auxiliary striker and , in what is in fact a distinct position unto its own , the number 10 ; the former role is exemplified by players such as Dennis Bergkamp ( who would play just behind the striker Thierry Henry at Arsenal ) , Alessandro Del Piero at Juventus , Youri Djorkaeff at Inter Milan , or Teddy Sheringham at Tottenham Hotspur . Other creative players who play further back , such as Diego Maradona , Ronaldinho , Kaká , and Zinedine Zidane are often instead described as the \" number 10 \" , and usually operate as an attacking midfielder or advanced playmaker . The second striker position is a loosely defined and most often misunderstood description of a player positioned in a free role , somewhere between the out-and-out striker , whether he or she is a \" target man \" or more of a \" poacher \" , and the number 10 or attacking midfielder , while possibly showing some of the characteristics of both . In fact , a term coined by French advanced playmaker Michel Platini , the \" nine-and-a-half \" , which he used to describe the playing role of his successor in the number 10 role at Juventus , Italian playmaker Roberto Baggio , has been an attempt to become a standard in defining the position . Conceivably , a number 10 can alternate as a second-striker provided that he or she is also a prolific goalscorer ; otherwise , a mobile forward with good technical ability ( dribbling skills and ball control ) , acceleration , vision , passing , and link-up play , who can both score and create opportunities for a less versatile centre-forward , is more suited . Although they are often given \" licence to roam , \" and either run forward , or drop further back in order to pick up the ball in deeper areas , giving them more time and space in possession , second or support strikers do not tend to get as involved in the orchestration of attacks as the number 10 , nor do they bring as many other players into play , since they do not share the burden of responsibility , functioning predominantly in a supporting role as assist providers . In Italy , this role is known as a \" rifinitore \" , \" mezzapunta \" , or \" seconda punta \" , whereas in Brazil , it is known as \" segundo atacante \" or \" ponta-de-lança \" . Inside forward The position of inside forward was popularly used in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries . The inside forwards would support the centre-forward , running and making space in the opposition defence , and , as the passing game developed , supporting him with passes . The role is broadly analogous to the \" hole \" or second striker position in the modern game , although here , there were two such players , known as inside right and inside left . In early 2–3–5 formations the inside-forwards would flank the centre-forward on both sides . With the rise of the \" WM \" formation , the inside forwards were brought back to become attacking midfielders , supplying balls to the centre-forward and the two attacking outside forwards – known as the outside right and outside left . In Italian football jargon , the role of an inside forward was initially occasionally known as a mezzala ( literally \" half–winger , \" not to be confused with wing-half ) ; however , the use of this particular term to describe inside forwards is now obsolete , as the mezzala label was later reapplied to describe the role of offensive–minded central midfielders in Italian football , while the inside forward role was instead labelled as \" interno \" ( \" internal , \" in Italian ) in Italian football in subsequent years . In the modern game , inside forwards have been pushed up front to become either out-and-out attackers or false-9s , or out wide to become wingers ( in a 4–3–3 formation ) , or they have even been switched to a deeper position in which they are required to drop back to link-up with the midfield , while also supporting another striker playing alongside them up front ( in a 4–4–2 formation ) . Many teams still employ one of their strikers in this latter more withdrawn role as a support forward for the main striker , in a role broadly similar to the inside forward . Outside forward An outside forward plays as the advanced forward on the right or left wing – as an outside right or outside left , typically as part of a 2–3–5 formation or one of its variants . As football tactics have largely developed , and wingers have dropped back to become midfielders , the terminology has changed and \" outside forward \" has become a historical term . Many commentators and football analysts still refer to the wing positions as \" outside right \" and \" outside left \" . Such players in the modern era have been labelled \" wing forwards \" , particularly when the two wingers play high up the pitch in a 4–3–3 or similar formation , where the front 3 attacking players have 3 central midfielders behind them . A wing forward who is known for cutting inside and shooting can have the term \" inverted winger \" used interchangeably . The responsibilities of an outside forward include but are not limited to : Scoring : their first option should be to shoot , while their second option should be to find another way to create a goal opportunity for the team . Passing : when they run into a shooting angle that is unlikely to become a goal , they must find a way to pass the ball to the middle of the penalty box area allowing the centre-forwards to finish the job . Due to these responsibilities some of the most important attributes include : Good dribbling and circumventing defenders Speed as a necessity to produce effective counter-attacks Winger A winger is an attacking player who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines . They can be classified as forwards , considering their origin as the old \" outside-forward \" position , and continue to be termed as such in most parts of the world , especially in Latin and Dutch football cultures . However , in the British game ( in which the 4–4–2 formation and its variants are most commonly used ) they are usually counted as part of the midfield . It is a winger \\'s duty to beat opposing full-backs , deliver cut-backs or crosses from wide positions and , to a lesser extent , to beat defenders and score from close range . They are usually some of the quickest players in the team and usually have good dribbling skills as well . In Dutch , Spanish and Portuguese usage , the defensive duties of the winger have been usually confined to pressing the opposition fullbacks when they have the ball . Otherwise , a winger will drop closer to the midfield to make themself available , should their team win back the ball . In British and other northern European styles of football , the wide-midfielder is expected to track back all the way to their own corner flag should their full-back require help , and also to track back their marker , as well as tucking into the midfield when the more central players are trying to pressure the opposition for the ball . This is a large responsibility for attack-orientated players , and particularly those like Joaquín ( winger/wide midfielder ) , or Ryan Giggs ( winger/striker ) , and John Barnes ( winger/central midfielder ) , who lack the physical attributes of a wing-back or of a more orthodox midfield player . As these players grow older and lose their natural pace , they are frequently redeployed as \" number 10s \" between the midfield and the forward line , where their well-honed ball control , technical skills , ability to create chances , and improved reading of the game in the final third can serve to improve their teams \\' attacking options in tight spaces . An example is Inter Milan \\'s use of veteran Luís Figo behind one or two other attackers , either as a second striker or in a playmaking role as an attacking midfielder . In recent years there has been a trend of playing inverted wingers – wide players stationed on the \\'wrong \\' side of the pitch , in order to enable them to cut inside and shoot on their stronger foot and sometimes provide in-swinging crosses . This tactic was used by Frank Rijkaard , who , whilst at Barcelona , moved Lionel Messi from the left flank onto the right wing , initially against the player \\'s wishes . This allowed him to cut into the centre and shoot or cross with his left foot . Another example of a successful inverted winger partnership was Bayern Munich \\'s pairing of the left–footed Arjen Robben alongside the right–footed Franck Ribéry , on the right and left flanks respectively . A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an \" attacking , \" \" false , \" or \" goalscoring winger , \" as exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale \\'s roles on the left and right flank during their time at Real Madrid in particular . This label has been used to describe an offensive–minded inverted winger , who will seemingly operate out wide on paper , but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area , in order to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals , effectively functioning as a striker . This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the raumdeuter role in German football jargon ( literally \" space interpreter \" ) , as exemplified by Thomas Müller , namely an attacking–minded wide player , who will move into central areas in order to find spaces from which he can receive passes and score or assist goals . The \" false winger \" or \" seven-and-a-half \" is instead a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally , but who instead is deployed out wide on paper ; during the course of a match , however , they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch , in order to drag defenders out of position , congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area , so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards ; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank . Samir Nasri , who has been deployed in this role , once described it as that of a \" non-axial playmaker . \" On occasion , the role of an offensive winger can also be occupied by a different type of player . For example , certain managers have been known to use a \" wide target man \" on the wing , namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward , and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank , or drag full-backs out of position . Jostein Flo epitomizes this role so much so that a tactic was named after him – Flo Pass . Egil Olsen , while managing the Norway national football team , positioned Flo , usually a centre-forward , on the right flank to exploit the opposition full-backs \\' lack of aerial abilities . Another example is Mario Mandžukić , a natural centre-forward , who was used on the left flank under manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus during the 2016–17 season , as well as the following season . Unlike wide target men of earlier eras , Mandžukić was also tasked with pressing opposing players . Romelu Lukaku has also been used in this role on occasion . False 9 The false 9 , in some ways similar to a more advanced attacking midfielder/playmaker role , is an unconventional lone striker or centre-forward , who drops deep into midfield . The purpose of this is that it creates a problem for opposing centre-backs who can either follow the false 9 , leaving space behind them for onrushing midfielders , forwards or wingers to exploit , or leaving the false 9 to have time and space to dribble or pick out a pass . The term comes from the traditional number for centre-forwards ( nine ) , and the fact that normally a centre-forward traditionally stayed near the line of defenders until they got an opportunity to move past them toward goal . Key attributes for a false 9 are similar to those of a deep-lying striker : dribbling ability to take advantage of space between the lines , good short passing ability to link up with the midfield and vision to play through teammates making runs from deep to goal . The first false 9 in a World Cup was Juan Peregrino Anselmo in the Uruguay national team , although he could not play the match against Argentina in the 1930 World Cup due to injury . Matthias Sindelar was the false 9 of the Wunderteam , the Austria national team , in 1934 . A false 9 was also utilized by Hungary during the beginning of the 1950s , with striker Nándor Hidegkuti acting in the role . In 1953 , English football was astounded by the Hungarian team which beat England 6–3 at Wembley Stadium . The Revie Plan was a variation on the tactics used by the Hungarians , involving Don Revie playing as a deep-lying centre-forward . Revie started attacks by coming into the centre of the field to receive the ball , drawing the opposing centre-half out of position . The role can also be compared to the false role in which Hidegkuti operated . The system was first implemented by the Manchester City reserve team , who using the system went unbeaten for the last 26 games of the 1953–54 season . Before the start of the 1954–55 season , Manchester City manager Les McDowall called his team into pre-season training two weeks early to try the new tactic . Manchester City lost their first game using the system 5–0 , but as the players became more used to the system it started to become more successful . Using the system Manchester City reached the 1955 FA Cup Final , but lost to Newcastle United 3–1 . The following year City again reached the final where they played Birmingham City , this time winning 3–1 . Roma under manager Luciano Spalletti used Francesco Totti , nominally an attacking midfielder or trequartista , up-front in an innovative \" 4–6–0 \" formation ; this was met with a run of 11 consecutive victories . At Euro 2012 , Spain manager Vicente del Bosque , although sometimes deploying Fernando Torres as a traditional striker , often used Cesc Fàbregas as a false 9 in several matches , including the final . By the end of 2012 , the False 9 had gone \" mainstream \" with many clubs employing a version of the system . Barcelona \\'s Lionel Messi has been an exponent of the false 9 position to much success in recent years , first under coach Pep Guardiola and later under his successor Tito Vilanova . One approach to stop false 9s has been to create congestion in the midfield by bringing several players back into a more defensive role in an attempt to deny them space needed to create plays , notably in José Mourinho \\'s \" parking the bus \" strategy . In Italian football jargon , this role is known as the \" centravanti di manovra \" ( which literally translates to \" manoeuvring centre-forward \" ) . Target forward The term \" target forward \" or \" target man \" is often used to describe a particular type of striker or centre-forward whose main role is to win high balls in the air , hold up the ball , and create chances for other members of the team in addition to scoring goals themselves . These players are usually tall and physically strong , adept at heading the ball , and capable of playing with their back to goal in the final third of the pitch . Some of the most high-profile examples of this type of players in modern football include Olivier Giroud and Fernando Llorente , both World Cup winners , with the former having played the entire tournament as a starting line-up forward tasked primarily with pressing , counter-pressing , winning high or loose balls , and providing key passes to quicker and more agile teammates , namely Antoine Griezmann and/or Kylian Mbappé . Another example of a striker who played in this position is Didier Drogba . However , not any tall and/or physically strong player feels comfortable in the role of a \" target man \" , despite having all the necessary features . Such forwards as Zlatan Ibrahimović , Romelu Lukaku , and Erling Haaland have all rejected the term when applied to specifically them , with Ibrahimović preferring to be described as an attacking all-rounder , while Lukaku and Haaland have said to favor poaching goals rather than physical play . Strike teams and combinations A strike team is two or more strikers who work together . The history of football has been filled with many effective combinations . Three-man teams often operate in \" triangles \" , giving a wealth of attacking options . Four-man packages expand options even more . Strikers must also be flexible , and be able to switch roles at a moment \\'s notice , between the first ( advanced penetrator position ) , second ( deep-lying manoeuvre ) and third ( support and expansion , e.g . wings ) attacker roles . Another example was the Total Football played by the Dutch team in the 1970s , where the ability of their players , and in particular Johan Cruyff , to swap positions allowed a flexible attacking approach which opposition teams found difficult to effectively mark . In a two–player front-line , it is common for two forwards who complement one another to be paired together ; for example , former Italy manager Cesare Maldini often used a large , physical , and prolific player as a traditional centre-forward – such as Christian Vieri – alongside a smaller , faster , creative and more technical player as a second striker – such as Roberto Baggio or Alessandro Del Piero . Another similar example of an effective partnership at international level was that of Alex Morgan and Abby Wambach with the United States national team , who scored a combined 55 goals in 2012 , matching a 21-year-old record set in 1991 by Michelle Akers ( 39 goals ) and Carin Jennings ( 16 goals ) as the most goals scored by any duo in U.S . WNT history . One of the most prolific forward combinations in the history of the game was the front three of Barcelona , Lionel Messi , Luis Suárez and Neymar , dubbed MSN . On average they scored a goal every 45 minutes – two goals per game from the three forwards . The trio scored a record-breaking 131 goals in one season for Barcelona during 2015–16 . In 2017 , Kylian Mbappé , Neymar , and Edinson Cavani scored a record-breaking number of goals for Paris Saint-Germain in the Champions League group stage . The next year , the Liverpool attacking quartet of Roberto Firmino , Mohamed Salah , Sadio Mané and Philippe Coutinho , dubbed the \" Fab Four \" ( in reference to The Beatles ) , contributed to a record-breaking 47 goals for a single Champions League season .

Considered one of the best players of his generation and regarded by many as one of the greatest of all time , Ronaldinho won two FIFA World Player of the Year awards and a Ballon d\\'Or . A global icon of the sport , he was renowned for his technical skills , creativity , dribbling ability and accuracy from free-kicks , his use of tricks , feints , no-look passes and overhead kicks , as well as his ability to score and create goals . Ronaldinho made his career debut for Grêmio , in 1998 . At age 20 , he moved to Paris Saint-Germain in France before signing for Barcelona in 2003 . In his second season with Barcelona , he won his first FIFA World Player of the Year award as Barcelona won the 2004–05 La Liga title . The season that followed is considered one of the best in his career as he was integral in Barcelona winning the 2005–06 UEFA Champions League , their first in fourteen years , and another La Liga title , giving Ronaldinho his first career double , receiving the 2005 Ballon d\\'Or and his second FIFA World Player of the Year in the process . After scoring two spectacular solo goals in the first 2005–06 El Clásico , Ronaldinho became the second Barcelona player , after Diego Maradona in 1983 , to receive a standing ovation from Real Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu . Following a second-place La Liga finish to Real Madrid in the 2006–07 season and an injury-plagued 2007–08 season , Ronaldinho suffered a decline in his performances—often put down to a decrease in dedication and focus having achieved so much in the sport—and departed Barcelona to join AC Milan , where he won the 2010–11 Serie A . He returned to Brazil to play for Flamengo in 2011 and Atlético Mineiro a year later where he won the 2013 Copa Libertadores , before moving to Mexico to play for Querétaro and then back to Brazil to play for Fluminense in 2015 . Ronaldinho accumulated numerous other individual awards in his career : he was included in the UEFA Team of the Year and the FIFA World XI three times each , and was named UEFA Club Footballer of the Year for the 2005–06 season and South American Footballer of the Year in 2013 ; in 2004 , he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . In his international career with Brazil , Ronaldinho earned 97 caps and scored 33 goals and represented his country in two FIFA World Cups . After debuting with the Seleção by winning the 1999 Copa América , he was an integral part of the 2002 FIFA World Cup-winning team , starring alongside Ronaldo and Rivaldo in an attacking trio , and was named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team . As captain , he led his team to the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup title and was named man of the match in the final . He also captained the Brazil Olympic team to a bronze medal in men \\'s football at the 2008 Summer Olympics . Early and personal life Ronaldo de Assis Moreira was born on 21 March 1980 in the city of Porto Alegre , the state capital of Rio Grande do Sul , Brazil . His mother , Miguelina Elói Assis dos Santos , was a salesperson who studied to become a nurse . His father , João de Assis Moreira , was a shipyard worker and footballer for local club Esporte Clube Cruzeiro ( not to be confused with the larger Cruzeiro Esporte Clube ) . After Ronaldo \\'s older brother Roberto signed with Grêmio , the family moved to a home in the more affluent Guarujá section of Porto Alegre , which was a gift from Grêmio to convince Roberto to stay at the club . Still , Roberto \\'s career was ultimately cut short by injury . It was in their new home where his father hit his head and drowned in the swimming pool when Ronaldo was eight . Today , Roberto acts as his manager , while his sister Deisi works as his press coordinator . Ronaldo \\'s football skills began to blossom at the age of eight , and he was first given the nickname Ronaldinho – \" inho \" meaning small – because he was often the youngest and the smallest player in youth club matches . He developed an interest in futsal and beach football , which later expanded to organized football . Many of his signature moves originate from futsal , especially his ball control . His first brush with the media came at the age of 13 , when he scored all 23 goals in a 23–0 victory against a local team . Ronaldinho was identified as a rising star at the 1997 U-17 World Championship in Egypt , in which he scored two goals on penalty kicks . Growing up , his idols included the World Cup winning stars ; Rivelino ( from 1970 ) , Diego Maradona ( from 1986 ) , Romário ( from 1994 ) , and his two future international teammates Ronaldo and Rivaldo ( which would form the attacking trio in Brazil \\'s 2002 World Cup winning team ) . Ronaldinho is the father of a son , João , born on 25 February 2005 to Brazilian dancer Janaína Mendes and named after his late father . He gained Spanish citizenship in 2007 . In March 2018 , Ronaldinho joined the Brazilian Republican Party , which has links to the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God . Ronaldinho endorsed presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro in the 2018 Brazilian presidential election . Club career Grêmio Ronaldinho \\'s career began with the Grêmio youth squad . He made his senior side debut during the 1998 Copa Libertadores . 1999 saw the emergence of the 18-year-old Ronaldinho , with 22 goals in 47 matches , and he put in headlining displays in derbies against Internacional , most notably on 20 June 1999 in the Rio Grande do Sul State Championship final . In a match-winning performance , Ronaldinho embarrassed Internacional \\'s Brazilian legend and 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga , flicking the ball over his head on one occasion , and leaving him flat-footed in a mazy dribble on another . Ronaldinho achieved further success with Grêmio , winning the inaugural Copa Sul . In 2001 , Arsenal expressed interest in signing Ronaldinho , but the move collapsed after he could not obtain a work permit because he was a non-EU player who had not played enough international matches . He considered playing on loan with Scottish Premier League side St Mirren , which never happened due to his involvement in a fake passport scandal in Brazil . Paris Saint-Germain In 2001 , Ronaldinho signed a five-year contract with French club Paris Saint-Germain in a €5 million transfer . Upon his arrival in Paris , Ronaldinho was given the number 21 shirt and inserted into a lineup that included fellow Brazilian Aloísio , midfielder Jay-Jay Okocha and striker Nicolas Anelka . 2001–02 season Ronaldinho made his league debut for the club on 4 August 2001 , appearing as a substitute in a 1–1 draw with Auxerre . Ronaldinho spent the majority of the first few months of the 2001–02 season alternated between the bench and starter \\'s role . He scored his first goal for the club on 13 October in a 2–2 draw against Lyon , converting the equalizing penalty in the 79th minute after having come on ten minutes prior . After returning from the winter break , Ronaldinho went on a tear , scoring a goal in four consecutive matches to open the new campaign . He recorded impressive goals against Monaco , Rennes , Lens and Lorient . On 16 March 2002 , he recorded a double in PSG \\'s 3–1 victory against relegation strugglers Troyes . He scored his final league goal of the season in the club \\'s 2–0 win over Metz on 27 April . Ronaldinho was also influential in the 2001–02 Coupe de la Ligue , helping PSG reach the semi-finals where they were eliminated by Bordeaux . In a Round of 16 match against Guingamp , Ronaldinho scored two second half goals in the game after having entered the match as a half-time substitute . Despite Ronaldinho \\'s initial success with the club , the season was marred by controversy with Paris Saint-Germain manager Luis Fernández , claiming that the Brazilian was too focused on the Parisian nightlife rather than football , and complained that his holidays in Brazil never ended at the scheduled times . 2002–03 season Despite repeated rifts with Fernández , Ronaldinho returned to the team for the 2002–03 season , with the player switching to the number 10 shirt . Though his performances in his second season with the club were underwhelming compared to his first , Ronaldinho performed admirably with the club . On 26 October 2002 , he scored two goals in PSG \\'s 3–1 victory over Classique rivals Marseille . The first goal was a free kick , which curled past numerous Marseille players in the 18-yard box before sailing past goalkeeper Vedran Runje . In the return match , he again scored in PSG \\'s 3–0 victory at the Stade Vélodrome , running half the length of the field before flicking the ball over the goalkeeper . On 22 February 2003 , Ronaldinho scored the goal of the season ( chosen by public vote ) against Guingamp — he beat one opponent before playing a one-two to beat another , then lifted the ball over a third before beating a fourth with a step over ( dropping his shoulder , moving right but going left ) and finished by lifting the ball over the goalkeeper . Ronaldinho was also praised for his performance in the Coupe de France when he scored both goals in the club \\'s 2–0 win over Bordeaux in the semi-finals , which inserted PSG into the final . After scoring his first goal in the 22nd minute , Ronaldinho capped the game in the 81st minute , accurately chipping the ball at the 18-yard box over the head of goalkeeper Ulrich Ramé , despite Ramé being in a favorable position . For his performance , Ronaldinho was given a standing ovation by the Parisian supporters . Unfortunately for the club , however , Ronaldinho and the team failed to capture the form that got them to the final as they bowed out 2–1 to Auxerre due to a last minute goal from Jean-Alain Boumsong . Despite Ronaldinho \\'s performances , the club finished in a disappointing 11th-placed position . Following the season , Ronaldinho declared he wanted to leave the club after the capital club failed to qualify for any European competition . Barcelona Newly elected FC Barcelona president Joan Laporta stated , \" I said we would lead Barça to the forefront of the footballing world , and for that to occur we had to sign one of these three players , David Beckham , Thierry Henry or Ronaldinho \" . Henry remained with Arsenal , and Laporta then promised to bring Beckham to the club , but following his transfer to Real Madrid , Barcelona entered the running for Ronaldinho and outbid Manchester United for his signature in a €30 million deal . 2003–04 season The club where he would spend his peak years and the basis of his global fame , Ronaldinho made his Barcelona debut in a friendly against Juventus at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough , Massachusetts on 27 July , with coach Frank Rijkaard stating post match , \" He has something special every time he touches the ball . \" He scored his first competitive goal in La Liga on 3 September 2003 against Sevilla at 1.30 a.m . local time , in a match that kicked off at five minutes past midnight . After receiving the ball from his goalkeeper inside his own half , Ronaldinho ran through the midfield and dribbled past two Sevilla players before striking the ball from 30 yards which hammered off the underside of the crossbar and back up into the roof of the net . Ronaldinho suffered from injury during the first half of the campaign , and Barcelona slumped to 12th in the league standings midway through the season . Ronaldinho returned from injury and scored 15 goals in La Liga during the 2003–04 season , helping the team ultimately finish second in the league . His scooped pass set up the winning goal for Xavi away to Real Madrid on 25 April 2004 , the club \\'s first win at the Bernabéu in seven years , a result Xavi credits as the start of \" the Barcelona rise . \" 2004–05 season Ronaldinho won his first league title in 2004–05 , and was named FIFA World Player of the Year on 20 December 2004 . His captain at Barcelona , Carles Puyol , stated , \" The greatest compliment I could give him is that he \\'s given Barcelona our spirit back . He has made us smile again . \" His fame was growing with his entertaining and productive play in both the La Liga and the UEFA Champions League . On 8 March 2005 , Barcelona were eliminated from the latter competition by Chelsea in the first knockout round , losing 5–4 over two legs . Ronaldinho scored both goals in the 4–2 second leg loss at Stamford Bridge in London , the second a spectacular strike where he feinted to shoot before striking the ball with little back-lift past Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Čech from 20 yards out . On 1 May 2005 , Ronaldinho made the assist for Lionel Messi \\'s first goal for Barcelona , executing a scooped pass over the Albacete defence for Messi to finish . With his contract expiring in 2008 , Ronaldinho was offered an extension until 2014 that would have net him £85 million over nine years , but he turned it down . In September 2005 , he signed a two-year extension that contained a minimum-fee release clause that allowed him to leave should a club make an offer to Barcelona of at least £85 million for him . 2005–06 season By the end of the year 2005 , Ronaldinho had started to accumulate a host of personal awards . He won the inaugural FIFPro World Player of the Year in September 2005 , in addition to being included in the 2005 FIFPro World XI , and being named the 2005 European Footballer of the Year . Also that year , Ronaldinho was voted the FIFA World Player of the Year for the second consecutive year . He became only the third player to win the award more than once , after three-time winners Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane . His domination as the world \\'s best footballer was undisputed as he also won the prestigious Ballon d\\'Or for the only time in his career . On 19 November , Ronaldinho scored twice as Barcelona defeated Real Madrid 3–0 on the road in the first leg of El Clásico . After he sealed the match with his second goal , Madrid fans paid homage to his performance by applauding , so rare a tribute only Diego Maradona had ever been granted previously as a Barcelona player at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium . Ronaldinho stated , \" I will never forget this because it is very rare for any footballer to be applauded in this way by the opposition fans . \" The season is considered one of the best in Ronaldinho \\'s career as he was an instrumental part of Barcelona \\'s first Champions League title in 14 years . After winning their group convincingly , Barcelona faced Chelsea in the round of 16 for a rematch of the previous year . Ronaldinho scored a decisive goal in the second leg , going past three Chelsea defenders on the edge of the penalty area before beating the goalkeeper , sealing Barcelona \\'s qualification to the next round . He also contributed one goal in Barcelona \\'s elimination of Benfica in the quarter-finals with a 2–0 home victory . After a 1–0 semi-final aggregate win over Milan , in which Ronaldinho assisted the series \\' only goal by Ludovic Giuly , Barcelona progressed to the Champions League Final , which they won on 17 May 2006 with a 2–1 beating of Arsenal . Two weeks earlier , Barcelona had clinched their second-straight La Liga title with a 1–0 win over Celta de Vigo , giving Ronaldinho his first career double . Throughout the season , Ronaldinho linked up with prolific Cameroonian striker Samuel Eto \\' o in attack , providing a number of assists to the 34 goal striker ; Ronaldinho \\'s pass also put Eto \\' o through on goal in the Champions League Final from which he was brought down by Arsenal goalkeeper Jens Lehmann who was sent off . Ronaldinho finished the season with a career-best 26 goals , including seventeen in La Liga and seven in the Champions League , and was chosen for the UEFA Team of the Year for the third consecutive time and was named the 2005–06 UEFA Club Footballer of the Year . He was named in the six man shortlist for the 2006 Laureus World Sportsman of the Year , and was selected in the FIFA World XI . 2006–07 season On 25 November 2006 , Ronaldinho scored his 50th career league goal against Villarreal , then scored a second time with a spectacular overhead bicycle kick ; receiving Xavi \\'s cross , he flicked the ball up with his chest and spun 180 degrees to finish – Barcelona fans waved white handkerchiefs in admiration of the goal . Post match he told reporters that the latter was a goal he had dreamed of scoring since he was a boy . He scored once and set up two others in Barcelona \\'s 4–0 Club World Cup win over Mexico \\'s Club América on 14 December in Yokohama , Japan , but Barcelona were defeated 1–0 by Brazilian club Internacional in the final . Ronaldinho was the recipient of the Bronze Ball Award for the competition . The next day , Ronaldinho finished third in the 2006 FIFA World Player of the Year , behind 2006 World Cup-winning captain Fabio Cannavaro and Zinedine Zidane . In March 2007 , defending champions Barcelona were eliminated from the Champions League at the last 16 stage by Liverpool . Ronaldinho was forced to miss a charity match on 13 March due to an injury he had picked up several days earlier in Barcelona \\'s 3–3 El Clásico draw with Real Madrid . Although Ronaldinho scored his career-best 21 league goals , the team lost the title to Real with a worse head-to-head record , as both teams finished the season with the same number of points . 2007–08 season Ronaldinho played his 200th career match for Barcelona in a league match against Osasuna on 3 February 2008 . His 2007–08 campaign as a whole , however , was plagued by injuries , and a muscle tear in his right leg on 3 April prematurely ended his season . Having been a model professional and devoted himself to training during his hugely successful first three seasons at Barcelona , Ronaldinho \\'s partying lifestyle and lack of dedication to training saw his physical condition decline , with many at the club believing he was already below his prime . On 19 May 2008 , Barcelona club president Joan Laporta stated that Ronaldinho needed a \" new challenge \" , claiming that he needed a new club if he were to revive his career . Ronaldinho and Barcelona teammate Lionel Messi each captained a team of international stars in an anti-racism exhibition match in Venezuela on 28 June , which ended in a 7–7 draw . Ronaldinho finished with a pair of goals and two assists in what would be his last match as a Barcelona player . In preparation for the 2010 Joan Gamper Trophy , Ronaldinho sent an open letter to the fans and players of Barcelona , stating that his best years had been the five he spent in the Catalan club . It was a sad moment for him and he later said in an interview that he regretted leaving without playing long enough with Messi . AC Milan In July 2008 , Ronaldinho turned down a £25.5 million offer from Manchester City of the Premier League , with purported wages of £200,000 per week on offer , to join Italian Serie A giants AC Milan on a three-year contract thought to be worth around £5.1 million ( €6.5 million ) a year , for €22.05 million plus €1.05 million bonus each season ( €24.15 million in 2010 ) . With the number 10 already occupied by teammate Clarence Seedorf , he selected 80 as his jersey number . 2008–09 season Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Milan in a 1–0 derby victory over Inter Milan on 28 September . His first brace was in a 3–0 win over Sampdoria on 19 October . He scored a 93rd-minute match-winner against Braga in the UEFA Cup group stage on 6 November . Ronaldinho finished the 2008–09 season at Milan with 10 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions . After a good start to the season , Ronaldinho struggled with fitness , and was often played from the bench to end a disappointing first season for Milan . A perceived lack of dedication in training and a lifestyle of late night partying not befitting of an athlete saw him receive criticism , with Carlo Ancelotti , his coach at Milan in his first season in Italy , commenting , \" The decline of Ronaldinho has n\\'t surprised me . His physical condition has always been very precarious . His talent though has never been in question . \" 2009–10 season Ronaldinho \\'s second season did not begin on a high note , but he soon rediscovered his form and was arguably Milan \\'s best player of the season . Newly appointed coach Leonardo changed his role from a central attacking midfielder to the left side of midfield , with Alexandre Pato on the right , in an offensive 4–3–3 formation . On 10 January 2010 , Ronaldinho scored two goals against Juventus in an away match , sealing a 3–0 victory for Milan . In the following match , against Siena on 17 January , Ronaldinho scored his first hat-trick for Milan when he converted a penalty kick , scored with a header from a corner and finished with a strike into the top right corner from 20 yards out . The Estado De São Paulo newspaper declared , \" Ronaldinho revives his golden years . \" On 16 February , Ronaldinho played against Manchester United in the Champions League . He scored early in the game at the San Siro to give Milan the lead . Milan ended up losing the game 3–2 , with a goal from Paul Scholes and two goals from Wayne Rooney . Ronaldinho finished the season as the assists leader of Serie A . On a less positive note , however , he missed three penalties in the domestic season to add to one botched kick the previous season . Ronaldinho ended the Serie A campaign scoring two goals against Juventus ; Luca Antonini opened the scoring and Milan went on to win 3–0 in Leonardo \\'s last game in charge . 2010–11 season During the first half of the season , Ronaldinho was part of the team \\'s attack that also included two new signings , Zlatan Ibrahimović and Robinho . Before the winter break , he made 16 appearances , scored one goal , and made several assists . Despite leaving the club at half-season , he was still eligible for a 2010–11 Serie A winner \\'s medal as Milan won the competition . Flamengo After being heavily linked with a move back to his childhood club Grêmio , Ronaldinho joined Flamengo on 11 January 2011 with a contract ending in 2014 . During the transfer saga , many reports had linked the former World Player of the Year to joining different clubs , such as LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer , Blackburn Rovers of the Premier League , and Brazilian clubs Corinthians and Palmeiras . He was greeted by more than 20,000 fans at his unveiling at his new club on 13 January 2011 . Ronaldinho scored his first goal for Flamengo in the 3–2 victory against Boavista on 6 February 2011 . On 27 February , he converted a second-half free kick for Flamengo to beat Boavista 1–0 and win his first piece of silverware with the team , the Taça Guanabara . Ronaldinho lifted his first trophy with Flamengo after curling in a right-footed shot over the wall in the 71st minute at Engenhão stadium . The goal gave Flamengo its 19th Taça Guanabara title , which earned the Campeonato Carioca title two months later , as the team also won the Taça Rio . On 27 July 2011 , Ronaldinho scored a hat-trick in Flamengo \\'s 5–4 away win against rivals Santos , after being 3–0 down inside the first 30 minutes . On 31 May 2012 , after being absent for a few days , he sued Flamengo claiming lack of payment for four months and cancelled his contract with the club . Atlético Mineiro Ronaldinho made a move to Atlético Mineiro on 4 June 2012 in a six-month contract , just four days after leaving Flamengo . He wore number 49 in reference to his mother \\'s birth year since his preferred number 10 was already assigned to Guilherme in the 2012 season . Ronaldinho made his debut for Galo on 9 June 2012 , playing for 90 minutes in a 1–0 away win against Palmeiras , and scored his first goal for the club on 23 June 2012 against Náutico , from the penalty spot . Ronaldinho led Atlético Mineiro to a good 2012 season , in which the club finished second in the 2012 Brasileirão and qualified for the 2013 Copa Libertadores . Ronaldinho won the Bola de Ouro award , selected as the best player in the league . The following year , Ronaldinho helped Atlético win the Campeonato Mineiro and led the club to its first Copa Libertadores title . Ronaldinho scored four goals and assisted on eight occasions during Atlético \\'s dramatic title run , which included consecutive comebacks from 0–2 first leg defeats in both the semi-finals against Argentine club Newell \\'s Old Boys and the finals against Club Olimpia from Paraguay . Both ties were determined in Atlético \\'s favour after penalty shootouts . Although six years past his best , Ronaldinho \\'s displays saw him voted the 2013 South American Footballer of the Year . At the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup held in Morocco in December , Atlético lost 3–1 to Raja Casablanca in the semi-final , with Ronaldinho scoring from a free-kick . As the final whistle blew , the Raja Casablanca team rushed to their childhood idol and stripped him down to his underpants in search of souvenirs . He renewed his contract with Atlético in January 2014 . After winning the 2014 Recopa Sudamericana , Ronaldinho left the club in July , reaching an agreement to cancel his contract by mutual consent . Querétaro After becoming a free agent , Ronaldinho was offered contracts from English Conference South club Basingstoke Town and newly formed Indian Super League franchise Chennai Titans through their co-owner Prashant Agarwal , but eventually signed a two-year contract with Mexican club Querétaro on 5 September 2014 . Ronaldinho made his debut for Querétaro in a 1–0 loss to Tigres UANL where he missed a penalty kick . In his next match , however , against Guadalajara , he had a much better game , setting up Camilo Sanvezzo to score as well as scoring himself from a penalty kick in a 4–1 win . On 30 October 2014 , he scored a free kick against Atlas during an away match at the Estadio Jalisco . On 18 April 2015 , Ronaldinho scored twice against Liga MX title-holders América in an away game at the Estadio Azteca , in which his team won 4–0 . All of the spectators , mostly consisting of América supporters , gave a standing ovation to Ronaldinho after his goals had brought him to tears . This was the second time in Ronaldinho \\'s career he had received such an ovation from opposing fans ( after Madrid fans had applauded his performance in a Barcelona shirt in 2005 ) , and after the match , Ronaldinho stated in an interview , \" It is an emotion to live more . I had an ovation at the Bernabéu and now here . I never imagined this . It is something that makes me like Mexico even more and I feel right at home . \" Ronaldinho scored two penalties in consecutive matches , the second giving Querétaro the classification to the Liga MX playoffs . On 17 May 2015 , Querétaro progressed to the semi-finals after defeating Veracruz 4–3 aggregate . In the second match , Ronaldinho scored a free kick with the help of the opponent \\'s goalkeeper who made contact with the ball . Querétaro eventually advanced to the final after beating Pachuca on aggregate 2–2 . In the final against Santos Laguna , Querétaro lost the first leg 0–5 and then won the 2nd leg 3–0 but lost 3–5 on aggregate . In June 2015 , Ronaldinho , now 35 , announced his departure from the club and thanked the Mexican people and fans of Querétaro : \" I want to thank all the Mexican nation for all the days that I have lived with people so special , you will be forever in my heart . Thank you very much the Nation Gallos Blancos , which made me very proud to wear this shirt and defend this club . \" Fluminense On 11 July 2015 , Ronaldinho announced his return to Brazil and signed an 18-month contract with Fluminense , but on 28 September , Ronaldinho reached a mutual agreement with the club to terminate the deal . He made nine appearances during his two-month stint at the club , failing to impress and being heavily criticized by the fans . Fluminense sporting director Mario Bittencourt stated , \" Ronaldinho asked us for a meeting . He respectfully told us he did n\\'t feel he was able to perform as good as he wanted and that it was a bad situation for him . He made a great gesture in saying he was n\\'t being the player he felt he could be right now . I \\'ll never speak about whether or not he is retiring . That \\'s not something you say about a player of his calibre . He was always spectacular , as player and person . \" Futsal in India In July 2016 , Ronaldinho played for the Goa 5′s , a futsal team from Goa in India , together with Ryan Giggs , Paul Scholes , Míchel Salgado , and Hernán Crespo as well as futsal player Falcão in the Premier Futsal League . After two games , he left India to be an ambassador of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro . He was replaced by Cafu . From September to early October 2017 , Ronaldinho joined the Delhi Dragons from Delhi in the Premier Futsal League . He scored 16 goals in eight games . Retirement On 16 January 2018 , Ronaldinho confirmed his retirement from football through his brother/agent : \" He has stopped , it is ended . Let \\'s do something pretty big and nice after the Russia World Cup , probably in August . \" Such a celebration was supposed to take place three years after his last appearance for Fluminense , but has not materialized . He retired as one of just eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup , the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d\\'Or . Ronaldinho appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2018 FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 15 July , performing a few bars of the Russian folk song \" Kalinka \" ( sung by opera singer Aida Garifullina ) on an African drum . International career Youth teams In 1997 , Ronaldinho was part of the first Brazilian team to win the FIFA U-17 World Championship , which was held in Egypt , in which his first goal was a penalty against Austria in the first group match , which Brazil won 7–0 . Ronaldinho finished with two goals and was awarded the Bronze Ball award as Brazil scored a total of 21 goals while only conceding 2 . 1999 was a busy year for Ronaldinho in terms of international play . First he appeared in the South American Youth Championship , where he scored three goals in nine appearances and helped the U20s to reach third place . Then he took part in that year \\'s FIFA World Youth Championship in Nigeria , scoring his first goal in Brazil \\'s last group match . In the round of 16 , he scored two first-half goals in a 4–0 win over Croatia , and finished with three goals as Brazil were eliminated by Uruguay in the quarter-finals . Early success On 26 June , three days before the start of the 1999 Copa América , he earned his first cap for Brazil in a 3–0 win over Latvia , and he scored one goal during Brazil \\'s victorious Copa América campaign . One week after the conclusion of the Copa América , he was called up for the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup , in which he scored in every match except the final , including a hat-trick in an 8–2 semi-final rout of Saudi Arabia . In the final , Brazil lost 4–3 to Mexico . Ronaldinho won the Golden Ball award for the best player in tournament as well as the Golden Boot award for the tournament top-scorer . In 2000 , Ronaldinho participated in the Summer Olympics in Sydney , Australia , with the U23 national team . Earlier that year , Ronaldinho led Brazil to win the Pre-Olympic Tournament , scoring nine goals in seven matches . In the Olympics , however , Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-finals by Cameroon , who later won the gold medal . Ronaldinho appeared four times and scored only one goal , which came in the quarter-final defeat by Cameroon . 2002 World Cup glory Ronaldinho participated in his first World Cup in 2002 , as part of a formidable offensive unit with Ronaldo and Rivaldo , dubbed the \" Three Rs \" , who were also on the 1999 Copa América winning squad . The World Cup was held in South Korea and Japan , and Ronaldinho appeared in five matches during the tournament and scored two goals , as well as contributing with three assists . His first goal came in the group stage match against China PR , which Brazil won 4–0 . The most memorable match in Ronaldinho \\'s World Cup career took place in the quarter-final against England on 21 June . With Brazil trailing after Michael Owen \\'s 23-minute strike , Ronaldinho turned the game around . Having received the ball inside his own half , Ronaldinho ran at the England defence and wrong footed star defender Ashley Cole with a trademark step over before passing the ball to Rivaldo on the edge of the penalty area to score the equalising goal just before half-time . Then , in the 50th minute , Ronaldinho took a free-kick from 40 yards out which curled into the top left corner of the net , completely surprising England \\'s goalkeeper David Seaman , giving Brazil a 2–1 lead . Seven minutes later , however , he was controversially sent-off for a foul on England \\'s defender Danny Mills . Ronaldinho was suspended for the semi-final , but returned to Brazil \\'s starting lineup for the 2–0 victory over Germany in the final as Brazil won its record fifth World Cup title . 2005 Confederations Cup title Ronaldinho \\'s next international tournament was the 2003 Confederations Cup , in which he went scoreless as Brazil were eliminated in the group stage . The following year , he was dropped from Brazil \\'s 2004 Copa América squad , as coach Carlos Alberto Parreira decided to rest his stars and used a largely reserve squad . After falling short in 1999 and 2003 , Ronaldinho was the captain of Brazil and led his team to its second ever Confederations Cup title in 2005 . He converted a penalty kick in a 3–2 semi-final win against host Germany and was named Man of the Match in a 4–1 victory over archrival Argentina in the final on 29 June . Ronaldinho scored three goals in the tournament and is tied with Mexican forward Cuauhtémoc Blanco as the tournament \\'s all-time scorer with nine goals . 2006 World Cup disappointment For the 2006 World Cup finals , Ronaldinho was part of Brazil \\'s much-publicized \" magic quartet \" of offensive players alongside Adriano , Ronaldo and Kaká , which was expected to provide the \" Joga Bonito \" style of play that was the focus of an extensive advertising campaign by Nike leading up to the tournament . However , deemed \" top heavy and unbalanced \" , the team finished with ten goals in five games , with Ronaldinho himself going scoreless and finishing with only one assist ( for Gilberto \\'s goal in a 4–1 group stage victory over Japan ) , as he turned in his worst collective performance in his international career . Brazil endured a disappointing campaign that culminated in a 1–0 loss to France in the quarter-finals , during which the Seleção had only one shot on goal . The team was harshly criticized by Brazilian fans and media following their return home . On 3 July , two days after Brazil \\'s elimination , vandals immolated and destroyed a 23-foot ( 7.5-metre ) tall fiberglass and resin statue of Ronaldinho in Chapecó . The statue had been erected in 2004 to celebrate his first FIFA World Player of the Year award . That same day , Ronaldinho , joined by Adriano , returned to the city of Barcelona and held a party at his home , which was continued into the early morning hours at a nightclub . This aggravated the hard feelings of many Brazilian fans , who believed that they were betrayed by the lack of effort from the squad . Displaying a passivity to Brazil \\'s poor showing , the 2006 World Cup is now seen as the turning point in Ronaldinho \\'s career , with his time at the summit of the game almost up . 1970 Brazil World Cup winner Tostão wrote in O Tempo : \" Ronaldinho lacks an important characteristic of Maradona and Pelé — aggression . They transformed themselves in adversity . They became possessed , and furious . \" 2008 Olympic medal On 24 March 2007 , Ronaldinho scored twice in a 4–0 win over Chile , which marked his first goal since the 2005 Confederations Cup final and thus ended a scoreless streak that lasted nearly two years . He was not called up for the 2007 Copa América after asking to be excused from the tournament due to fatigue . On 18 October , he was controversially benched by Barcelona after he was late returning to Spain following Brazil \\'s 5–0 friendly win over Ecuador . He and several Brazil players celebrated the win by partying through the night at a posh Rio de Janeiro nightclub . Ronaldinho left at 11 am the next morning , allegedly in the trunk of a car in order to avoid the media . On 7 July 2008 , Ronaldinho was named in Brazil \\'s 2008 Summer Olympics squad as one of the over-age players . Barcelona initially blocked the move because of his then-upcoming Champions League commitments with the club , but the decision was later nullified following Ronaldinho \\'s transfer to Milan , who in turn permitted him to make the trip to Beijing , China . Ronaldinho captained the team , and he scored his only two goals in a 5–0 victory over New Zealand before Brazil were beaten by Argentina in the semi-final . Brazil finished with the bronze medal after defeating Belgium 3–0 in the bronze medal match . 2010 and 2014 World Cup absence Despite having returned to good form and being named as a member of the 30-man provisional squad that was submitted to FIFA on 11 May 2010 , he was not named in coach Dunga \\'s final squad of 23 for the Brazilian squad in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup despite his deep desire to participate in the competition . Critics claimed that the exclusion of players such as Ronaldinho , Alexandre Pato , Adriano and Ronaldo signaled a move away from the classic Brazilian attacking \" Joga Bonito \" style of play . At the tournament , Brazil was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-final . In September 2011 , Ronaldinho made his return to the national team under coach Mano Menezes in a friendly against Ghana at Fulham \\'s Craven Cottage , playing the full 90 minutes in a 1–0 win for Brazil . He then had solid performances in back to back friendlies against Argentina in the same month . In October , he performed well against Mexico in a friendly , scoring a free kick to equalize after Dani Alves was sent off . Brazil went on to win the match with a goal from Marcelo . Ronaldinho \\'s good form continued in 2013 , and in January he was unexpectedly called up by coach Luiz Felipe Scolari for a friendly against England played on 6 February at Wembley Stadium as part of The Football Association ( FA ) \\'s 150th anniversary . Ronaldinho started in what was his 100th cap ( including non-official matches ) , and had a chance to score from the penalty kick , but his shot was saved by Joe Hart . Brazil lost the match 1–2 . He was again called up for the Seleção , being named captain of the national team for an international friendly with Chile on 24 April 2013 . However , Ronaldinho was not selected for the national team for the 2013 Confederations Cup and he was also omitted from Scolari \\'s 2014 World Cup finals squad . Player profile Style of play Ronaldinho Gaúcho is regarded as one of the greatest and most skilful players both of his generation and of all time . Due to his ability to score and create goals , he was capable of playing in several offensive positions , on either wing or in a free central role . Throughout his career , he was often deployed as a winger , although he usually played as a classic number 10 in an attacking midfielder role . While he is naturally right–footed , during his time at Barcelona , Ronaldinho was also used as an inverted winger on the left flank at times by manager Frank Rijkaard , while the left–footed Messi was deployed on the right ; this position allowed him to take on defenders on the outside and cross the ball , or cut inside and shoot on goal with his stronger foot . He was also capable of playing as a second striker . Despite primarily being a creative player , who was renowned for his passing , vision , and playmaking ability , Ronaldinho was an accurate finisher with either foot , both from inside and outside the penalty area , as well as being a free-kick and penalty kick specialist . Although he was primarily known for his ability to bend the ball from set pieces , he was also capable of striking the ball with power underneath the wall , and also occasionally used the knuckleball technique , which was popularised by his compatriot Juninho Pernambucano . His versatility and prowess from set pieces made him one of the most prolific free kick takers in history , and also influenced his former teammate Messi , who went on to become a free kick specialist himself . Throughout his career , Ronaldinho was praised by pundits in particular for his technical skills , flair , and creativity , as well as his exceptional first touch . With his pace , acceleration , athleticism , balance , ball control , and dribbling ability , he was capable of beating players when undertaking individual runs , often using an array of tricks and feints to get past opponents in one on one situations , including step overs and nutmegs . Physically strong in possession of the ball , Richard Williams writes \" slender in build , the Brazilian has a strength belying the cartoonish smile \" . He also incorporated flashy moves such as back–heels , bicycle kicks , and no–look passes into his general gameplay . Among his repertoire of moves , is the \" elastico \" , a move he learned by watching videos of one of his idols , the 1970s Brazilian star Rivelino . Ronaldinho came to be known as one of the best exponents of the feint , and in parts of Africa – especially Nigeria – this move is now called \\'The Gaúcho \\' after him , due to his role in popularising the use of this particular skill . Reception ESPN described Ronaldinho as being \" skillful by nature , his tricks are unparalleled and he is wonderful with the ball at his feet . One of the coolest players in pressure situations \" and a \" fast , brash , skilful , tricky , an uninhibited playmaker \" who provides \" a mix of goals , assists , skills and a large repertoire of crafty moves \" . Zlatan Ibrahimović stated , \" Prime Ronaldinho was phenomenal . He made his opponents look like children \" . Former Portugal midfield playmaker Rui Costa has said of his vision and passing ability : \" There are not many players who can offer goal-scoring passes like he can . He is just marvellous . He is a rare case of an assist man who can provide the ball from anywhere . \" In 2010 , his former Barcelona teammate , Edgar Davids , said of him : \" For the skills and tricks , Ronaldinho was the best player that I ever played with . \" Another one of his former Barcelona teammate , Henrik Larsson , echoed this view . His compatriot Willian rated him as the greatest player of all time in 2019 , while Juninho described him as the most skilful player he had ever seen . In 2019 , FourFourTwo described him as \" possibly the best technician in the history of football in Brazil , \" placing him at number five in their list of \" The 101 greatest football players of the last 25 years . \" In 2006 , Richard Williams of The Guardian described Ronaldinho as a \" genius , \" while his former Barcelona teammate Sylvinho said of him : \" He \\'s so smart , so intelligent , that sometimes it \\'s difficult to read his mind , \" also adding : \" He \\'s amazing . He \\'s 100 % talent . And he \\'s a powerful player as well , so it \\'s difficult to stop him . \" In spite of his performances at his peak , a period of dedication and focus which saw him named the FIFA World Player of the Year twice and receive the Ballon d\\'Or , Ronaldinho was also criticised on occasion in the media for his lack of discipline in training , as well as his hedonistic lifestyle off the pitch , which some pundits believed had an impact on the overall longevity of his career . Referring to Ronaldinho as \" Brazil \\'s childlike genius who never grew up \" , Tim Vickery writes that it was the sudden death of his father at such a young age that may have seen Ronaldinho stop making the sacrifices needed to remain at the summit of the sport , with the attitude of \" life is short and can end unexpectedly–so enjoy it while you can . \" Outside football Ronaldinho has had endorsements with many companies , including Nike , Pepsi , Coca-Cola , EA Sports and Danone . One of the world \\'s highest paid players , in 2006 he earned over $ 19 million from endorsements . Having endorsed Pepsi for much of his career and appeared in commercials with David Beckham , Thierry Henry and Lionel Messi , Ronaldinho signed a deal with Coca-Cola in 2011 , however this was terminated in July 2012 after he was caught drinking Pepsi in a news conference . Ronaldinho has featured in EA Sports \\' FIFA video game series , appearing on the cover of FIFA Football 2004 , FIFA Street , FIFA 06 , FIFA 07 , FIFA Street 3 , FIFA 08 and FIFA 09 . At the beginning of his career Ronaldinho signed a lucrative 10-year deal with sportswear company Nike ( wearing Nike Tiempo R10 boots designed for him ) . He has appeared in Nike commercials , including the 2002 \" Secret Tournament \" commercial ( branded \" Scorpion KO \" ) directed by Terry Gilliam . His 2005 Nike advertisement , where he is given a new pair of boots and then proceeds to juggle a football and appears to repeatedly volley it against the crossbar of a goal and recover it without the ball touching the ground , went viral on YouTube , becoming the site \\'s first video to reach one million views . A 2010 Nike commercial , Write the Future directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu , features Ronaldinho executing a number of stepovers , which became a viral video re-enacted and shared millions of times . A wax sculpture of Ronaldinho was unveiled at Madame Tussauds Hong Kong in December 2007 . Ronaldinho has had an official role with UNICEF , the United Nations Children \\'s Fund , since February 2006 . In 2011 , he was recruited by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS to promote awareness among young people of the disease and how to avoid it . In March 2015 , Ronaldinho was the sixth most popular sportsperson on Facebook , behind Cristiano Ronaldo , Messi , Beckham , Neymar and Kaká , with 31 million Facebook fans . Ronaldinho also has over 50 million Instagram followers . On 2 February 2017 , Barcelona announced that Ronaldinho signed a 10-year deal to become an ambassador for the club at institutional events . On 6 July 2018 , Ronaldinho announced a partnership with company World Soccer Coin ( WSC ) to develop a new cryptocurrency , the Ronaldinho Soccer Coin , with WSC claiming that the profits of the coin will be used to football projects such as \" Ronaldinho Digital Stadiums . \" On 25 October 2020 , Ronaldinho announced that he tested positive for COVID-19 and was asymptomatic and self-isolating in Belo Horizonte . A few days later , on 29 October 2020 , Ronaldinho released a statement regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and Azerbaijan . He expressed solidarity with Azerbaijani people . In late July 2021 , he went to Beirut , Lebanon , to lay a wreath in honor of victims of the port explosion . Legal troubles In July 2019 , 57 properties belonging to Ronaldinho along with his Brazilian and Spanish passports were confiscated because of unpaid taxes and fines . The judge ultimately decided to reduce the fine from R $ 8.5 million to R $ 6 million for building a fishing platform on Guaíba River in a \\'heritage-protected \\' area . Ronaldinho and his brother would ultimately fail to pay the fines within the allotted time and have their passports suspended . In March 2020 , he was questioned by police in Paraguay after he was alleged to have used a fake passport to enter the country while coming for a charity event and book promotion , with Ronaldinho and his brother both being held in custody in the country . While in prison , he competed in a prison futsal tournament , where his team was victorious . They won 11–2 in the finals , with Ronaldinho scoring 5 goals and assisting the other 6 . He attempted to appeal the detention order but was ordered to remain under house arrest with his brother .

Ancona is the capital of the province of Ancona and of the region . The city is located northeast of Rome , on the Adriatic Sea , between the slopes of the two extremities of the promontory of Monte Conero , Monte Astagno and Monte Guasco . Ancona is one of the main ports on the Adriatic Sea , especially for passenger traffic , and is the main economic and demographic centre of the region . History Greek colony Ancona was populated as a region by Picentes since the 6th century BC who also developed a small town there . Ancona took a more urban shape by Greek settlers from Syracuse in about 387 BC , who gave it its name : Ancona stems from the Greek word ( Ankṓn ) , meaning \" elbow \" ; the harbour to the east of the town was originally protected only by the promontory on the north , shaped like an elbow . Greek merchants established a Tyrian purple dye factory here . In Roman times it kept its own coinage with the punning device of the bent arm holding a palm branch , and the head of Aphrodite on the reverse , and continued the use of the Greek language . Roman Municipum When it became a Roman town is uncertain . It was occupied as a naval station in the Illyrian War of 178 BC . Julius Caesar took possession of it immediately after crossing the Rubicon . Its harbour was of considerable importance in imperial times , as the nearest to Dalmatia , and was enlarged by Trajan , who constructed the north quay with his architect Apollodorus of Damascus . At the beginning of it stands the marble triumphal arch , the Arch of Trajan with a single archway , and without bas-reliefs , erected in his honour in 115 by the Senate and Roman people . Byzantine City Ancona was attacked successively by the Goths and Lombards between the 3rd and 5th centuries , but recovered its strength and importance . It was one of the cities of the Pentapolis of the Exarchate of Ravenna , a lordship of the Byzantine Empire , in the 7th and 8th centuries . In 840 , Saracen raiders sacked and burned the city . After Charlemagne \\'s conquest of northern Italy , it became the capital of the Marca di Ancona , whence the name of the modern region derives . Maritime Republic of Ancona After 1000 , Ancona became increasingly independent , eventually turning into an important maritime republic ( together with Gaeta and Ragusa , it is one of those not appearing on the Italian naval flag ) , often clashing against the nearby power of Venice . An oligarchic republic , Ancona was ruled by six Elders , elected by the three terzieri into which the city was divided : S . Pietro , Porto and Capodimonte . It had a coin of its own , the agontano , and a series of laws known as Statuti del mare e del Terzenale and Statuti della Dogana . Ancona was usually allied with the Republic of Ragusa and the Byzantine Empire . In 1137 , 1167 and 1174 it was strong enough to push back the forces of the Holy Roman Empire . Anconitan ships took part in the Crusades , and their navigators included Cyriac of Ancona . In the struggle between the Popes and the Holy Roman Emperors that troubled Italy from the 12th century onwards , Ancona sided with the Guelphs . Unlike other cities of northern Italy , Ancona never became a signoria . The sole exception was the rule of the Malatesta , who took the city in 1348 , taking advantage of the black death and of a fire that had destroyed many of the city \\'s important buildings . The Malatesta were ousted in 1383 . In 1532 Ancona definitively lost its freedom and became part of the Papal States , under Pope Clement VII . The symbol of the new papal authority was the massive Citadel . In the Papal States Together with Rome and Avignon in southern France , Ancona was one of three cities in the Papal States in which the Jews were allowed to stay after 1569 , living in the ghetto built after 1555 . In 1733 Pope Clement XII extended the quay , and an inferior imitation of Trajan \\'s arch was set up ; he also erected a Lazaretto at the south end of the harbour , Luigi Vanvitelli being the architect-in-chief . The southern quay was built in 1880 , and the harbour was protected by forts on the heights . From 1797 onwards , when the French took it , it frequently appears in history as an important fortress . The Greek community of Ancona Ancona , as well as Venice , became a very important destination for merchants from the Ottoman Empire during the 16th century . The Greeks formed the largest of the communities of foreign merchants . They were refugees from former Byzantine or Venetian territories that were occupied by the Ottomans in the late 15th and 16th centuries . The first Greek community was established in Ancona early in the 16th century . Contemporary history Ancona entered the Kingdom of Italy when Christophe Léon Louis Juchault de Lamoricière surrendered here on 29 September 1860 , eleven days after his defeat at Castelfidardo . On 23 May 1915 , Italy entered World War I and joined the Entente Powers . In 1915 , following Italy \\'s entry , the battleship division of the Austro-Hungarian Navy carried out extensive bombardments causing great damage to all installations and killing several dozen people . Ancona was one of the most important Italian ports on the Adriatic Sea during the Great War . During World War II , the city was taken by the Polish 2nd Corps against Nazi German forces , as Free Polish forces were serving as part of the British Army . Poles were tasked with capture of the city on 16 June 1944 and accomplished the task a month later on 18 July 1944 in what is known as the battle of Ancona . The attack was part of an Allied operation to gain access to a seaport closer to the Gothic Line in order to shorten their lines of communication for the advance into northern Italy . Jewish history Jews began to live in Ancona in 967 A.D . It has been claimed that in 1270 , a Jewish resident of Ancona , Jacob of Ancona , travelled to China , four years before Marco Polo , and documented his impressions in a book called \" The City of Lights \" . From 1300 and on , the Jewish community of Ancona grew steadily , most due to the city importance and it being a center of trade with the Levant . In that year , Jewish poet Immanuel the Roman tried to lower high taxation taken from the Jewish community of the city . Over the next 200 years , Jews from Germany , Spain , Sicily and Portugal immigrated to Ancona , due to persecutions in their homeland and thanks to the pro-Jewish attitude taken towards Ancona Jews due to their importance in the trade and banking business , making Ancona a trade center . In 1550 , the Jewish population of Ancona numbered about 2700 individuals . In 1555 , pope Paul IV forced the Crypto-Jewish community of the city to convert to Christianity , as part of his Papal Bull of 1555 . While some did , others refused to do so and thus were hanged and then burnt in the town square . In response , Jewish merchants boycotted Ancona for a short while . The boycott was led by Dona Gracia Mendes Nasi . Though emancipated by Napoleon I for several years , in 1843 Pope Gregory XVI revived an old decree , forbidding Jews from living outside the ghetto , wearing identification sign on their clothes and other religious and financial restrictions . Public opinion did not approve of these restrictions , and they were cancelled a short while after . The Jews of Ancona received full emancipation in 1848 with the election of Pope Pius IX . In 1938 , 1177 lived in Ancona ; 53 Jews were sent away to Germany , 15 of them survived and returned to the town after World War II . The majority of the Jewish community stayed in town or emigrated due to high ransoms paid to the fascist regime . In 2004 , about 200 Jews lived in Ancona . Two synagogues and two cemeteries still exist in the city . The ancient Monte-Cardeto cemetery is one of the biggest Jewish cemeteries in Europe and tombstones are dated to 1552 and on . It can still be visited and it resides within the Parco del Cardeto . Geography Climate The climate of Ancona is humid subtropical ( Cfa in the Köppen climate classification ) and the city lies on the border between mediterranean and more continental regions . Precipitations are regular throughout the year . Winters are cool ( January mean temp . ) , with frequent rain and fog . Temperatures can reach or even lower values outside the city centre during the most intense cold waves . Snow is not unusual with air masses coming from Northern Europe or from the Balkans and Russia , and can be heavy at times ( also due to the \" Adriatic sea effect \" ) , especially in the hills surrounding the city centre . Summers are usually warm and humid ( July mean temp . ) . Highs sometimes reach values around , especially if the wind is blowing from the south or from the west ( föhn effect off the Appennine mountains ) . Thunderstorms are quite common , particularly in August and September , when can be intense with occasional flash floods and even large hail . Spring and autumn are both seasons with changeable weather , but generally mild . Extremes in temperature have been ( in 1967 ) and ( in 1968 ) / ( in 1983 ) . Demographics In 2007 , there were 101,480 people residing in Ancona ( the greater area has a population more than four times its size ) , located in the province of Ancona , Marches , of whom 47.6 % were male and 52.4 % were female . Minors ( children ages 18 and younger ) totalled 15.54 percent of the population compared to pensioners who number 24.06 percent .

The church was restored in the 1980s . Arch of Trajan The Arch of Trajan is a marble structure high , but only wide , standing on a high platform approached by a wide flight of steps , and is one of the finest surviving Roman monuments in the Marches . It was built in the year 114/115 as an entrance to the causeway atop the harbour wall and is named in honour of Trajan , the emperor who made the harbour . Most of its original bronze ornaments have disappeared . The archway is flanked by pairs of fluted Corinthian columns on pedestals . A pediment bears inscriptions . The format is that of the Arch of Titus in Rome , but made taller , so that the bronze figures surmounting it , of Trajan , his wife Plotina and sister Marciana , would figure as a landmark for ships approaching Rome \\'s greatest Adriatic port .

The competition 's official name was originally the European Super Cup ; it was renamed the UEFA Super Cup in 1995 , following a policy of rebranding by UEFA . It is not recognised as one of UEFA 's major competitions . From 1972 to 1999 , the UEFA Super Cup was contested between the winners of the European Cup/UEFA Champions League and the winners of the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup . After the discontinuation of the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , it has been contested by the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the winners of the UEFA Cup , which was renamed the UEFA Europa League in 2009 . The current holders are Chelsea , who won 6–5 on penalties following a 1–1 draw after extra time against Villarreal in 2021 . The most successful teams in the competition are Barcelona and Milan , who have won the trophy five times each . History The European Super Cup was created in 1971 by Anton Witkamp , a reporter and later sports editor of Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf . The idea came to him in a time when Dutch total football was Europe 's finest and Dutch football clubs were enjoying their golden era ( especially Ajax ) . Witkamp was looking for something new to definitely decide which was the best team in Europe and also to further test Ajax 's team , led by their star player Johan Cruyff . It was then proposed that the winner of the European Cup would face the winner of the European Cup Winners ' Cup . All was set for a new competition to be born . However , when Witkamp tried to get an official endorsement to his competition , the UEFA president turned it down . The 1972 final between Ajax and Scotland 's Rangers is considered unofficial by UEFA , as Rangers were banned from European competition due to the behaviour of their fans during the 1972 UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup Final . As a result , UEFA refused to endorse the competition until the following season . It was played in two legs and was financially supported by De Telegraaf . Ajax defeated Rangers 6–3 on aggregate and won the first ( albeit unofficial ) European Super Cup . The 1973 final , in which Ajax defeated Milan 6–1 on aggregate , was the first Super Cup officially recognised and supported by UEFA . Although the two-legged format was kept until 1997 , the Super Cup was decided in one single match because of schedule issues or political problems in 1984 , 1986 , and 1991 . In 1974 , 1981 and 1985 , the Super Cup was not played at all : 1974 's competition was abandoned because Bayern Munich and Magdeburg could not find a mutually convenient date , 1981 's was abandoned when Liverpool could not make space to meet Dinamo Tbilisi , while 1985 's was abandoned due to a ban on English clubs ' participation preventing Everton from playing Juventus . In the 1992–93 season , the European Cup was renamed the UEFA Champions League and the winners of this competition would face the winners of the Cup Winners ' Cup in the European Super Cup . In the 1994–1995 season , the European Cup Winners ' Cup was renamed the UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup . The following season , the Super Cup also renamed the UEFA Super Cup . After the 1998–99 season , the Cup Winners ' Cup was discontinued by UEFA . The 1999 Super Cup was the last one contested by the winners of the Cup Winners ' Cup . Lazio , winners of the 1998–99 UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup , defeated Manchester United , winners of the 1998–99 UEFA Champions League , 1–0 . Since then , the UEFA Super Cup was contested between the winners of the UEFA Champions League and the winners of the UEFA Cup . The 2000 Super Cup was the first one contested by the winners of the UEFA Cup . Galatasaray , winners of the 1999–2000 UEFA Cup , defeated Real Madrid , winners of the 1999–2000 UEFA Champions League , 2–1 . In the 2009–10 season , the UEFA Cup was renamed the UEFA Europa League and the winners of this competition would continue to face the winners of the Champions League in the UEFA Super Cup . In 2013 , Chelsea became the first club to contest the Super Cup as holders of all three UEFA club honours , having entered as holders of the Cup Winners ' Cup ( 1998 ) , Champions League ( 2012 ) , and Europa League ( 2013 ) . Manchester United shared this honour in 2017 after their Europa League win , having qualified as Cup Winners ' Cup holders in 1991 . After 15 consecutive Super Cups being played at Stade Louis II in Monaco between 1998 and 2012 , the Super Cup is now played at various stadiums ( similar to the finals of the Champions League and the Europa League ) . It was started with the 2013 edition , which was played at Eden Stadium in Prague , Czech Republic . Starting in 2014 , the date of the UEFA Super Cup was moved from Friday in late August , to Tuesday in mid-August , following the removal of the August international friendly date in the new FIFA International Match Calendar . In 2020 , the Super Cup final was originally scheduled to be played at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto , Portugal , on 12 August 2020 . However , after the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe caused the postponements of the previous season 's club finals , the UEFA Executive Committee chose to award the rescheduled Champions League final to Portugal , and postponed the match for 24 September 2020 and relocated the stadium to Puskás Aréna , Budapest . Following discussions with its 55 member associations on 19 August 2020 , the UEFA Executive Committee decided on 25 August 2020 to use the final as a pilot match for which a reduced number of spectators , up to 30 % of the capacity of the stadium , can be allowed in , and it became the first official UEFA match to have spectators since their competitions were resumed in August 2020 . Venues The competition was originally played over two legs , one at each participating club 's stadium , except in exceptional circumstances ; for instance in 1991 when Red Star Belgrade were not permitted to play the leg in their native Yugoslavia due to the war which was taking place at the time , so instead Manchester United 's home leg was only played . Since 1998 , the Super Cup was played as a single match at a neutral venue . Between 1998 and 2012 , the Super Cup was played at the Stade Louis II in Monaco . Since 2013 various stadiums have been used . List of venues since 1998 1998–2012 : Stade Louis II , Monaco 2013 : Eden Arena , Prague , Czech Republic 2014 : Cardiff City Stadium , Cardiff , Wales 2015 : Boris Paichadze Dinamo Arena , Tbilisi , Georgia 2016 : Lerkendal Stadion , Trondheim , Norway 2017 : Philip II Arena , Skopje , Macedonia 2018 : A .

A full-size replica trophy is awarded to the winning club . Forty gold medals are presented to the winning club and forty silver medals to the runners-up . The Super Cup trophy has undergone several changes in its history . The first trophy was presented to Ajax in 1973 . In 1977 , the original trophy was replaced by a plaque with a gold UEFA emblem . In 1987 , the next trophy was the smallest and lightest of all the European club trophies , weighing and measuring in height ( the UEFA Champions League trophy weighs and the UEFA Europa League trophy ) . It was designed and manufactured at the Bertoni workshop in Milan . The new model , which is a larger version of the previous trophy , was introduced in 2006 and weighs and measures in height . Until 2008 , a team which won three times in a row or five in total received an original copy of the trophy and a special mark of recognition . Since then , the original trophy has been kept exclusively by UEFA . Milan and Barcelona have achieved this honour , winning a total of five times each but the Italian team is the only one which was awarded the official trophy permanently in 2007 . Prize money As of 2020 , the fixed amount of prize money paid to the clubs is as follows : Runner-up : €3,800,000 Winner : €5,000,000 Rules Currently , the rules of the UEFA Super Cup are that it is a single match , contested in a neutral venue . The match consists of two periods of 45 minutes each , known as halves . If the scores are level at the end of 90 minutes , two additional 15-minute periods of extra time are played . If there is no winner at the end of the second period of extra time , a penalty shoot-out determines the winner . Each team names 23 players , 11 of which start the match . Of the 12 remaining players , a total of 3 may be substituted throughout the match ; a fourth substitute is permitted however if the match enters extra time . Each team may wear its first choice kit ; if these clash , however , the previous year 's Europa League winning team must wear an alternative colour . If a club refuses to play or is ineligible to play then they are replaced by the runner-up of the competition through which they qualified . If the field is unfit for play due to bad weather , the match must be played the next day . Sponsorship The UEFA Super Cup 's sponsors are the same as the sponsors for the UEFA Champions League .

As of 2011 , the FIFA franchise has been localised into 18 languages and available in 51 countries . Listed in Guinness World Records as the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world , the FIFA series has sold over 325 million copies as of 2021 . Football video games such as Tehkan World Cup , Sensible Soccer , Kick Off and Match Day had been developed since the late 1980s , and were already competitive in the games market when EA Sports announced a football game as the next addition to their EA Sports label . When the series began with FIFA International Soccer on the Sega Mega Drive in late 1993 , it was notable for being the first to have an official license from FIFA , the world governing body of football . The main series has been complemented by additional installments based on single major tournaments , such as the FIFA World Cup , UEFA Champions League , UEFA Europa League and UEFA European Football Championship , as well as a series of football management titles . Since the 1990s , the franchise \\'s main competitor has been Konami \\'s Pro Evolution Soccer ( PES ) series ( now renamed as eFootball ) . As of FIFA 22 , Paris Saint-Germain forward Kylian Mbappé is the face of the franchise , appearing on the front cover of the series for the second consecutive year following FIFA 21 and in promotional campaigns and advertisements . He took over from Eden Hazard of Real Madrid who was the face of FIFA 20 . Lionel Messi appeared on four straight covers from FIFA 13 to FIFA 16 . Wayne Rooney appeared in seven covers of the series : every game from FIFA 06 to FIFA 12 . Ronaldinho appeared alongside Rooney on four of these ( FIFA 06 to FIFA 09 ) , and he also appeared on the cover of FIFA Football 2004 , FIFA Street and FIFA Street 3 . Since the release of FIFA Mobile in 2016 , midfielder Kevin de Bruyne and forwards Marco Reus , Hazard , Cristiano Ronaldo , Neymar , Paulo Dybala , and Mbappé have appeared on the cover . FIFA 12 holds the record for the \" fastest selling sports game ever \" with over 3.2 million games sold and over $ 186 million generated at retail in its first week of release . The franchise \\'s latest release , FIFA 22 , was released worldwide on 1 October 2021 . It is available for multiple gaming systems , including the PlayStation 4 , Xbox One , Nintendo Switch , PC , PlayStation 5 , Xbox Series X and Series S and Stadia . History While FIFA 95 did not add much other than the ability to play with club teams , FIFA 96 pushed the boundaries . For the first time with real player names by obtaining the FIFPro license , the PlayStation , PC , 32X and Sega Saturn versions used EA \\'s \" Virtual Stadium \" engine , with 2D sprite players moving around a real-time 3D stadium . FIFA 97 improved on this with polygonal models for players and added an indoor soccer mode , but an early pinnacle was reached with FIFA : Road to World Cup 98 . This version featured much improved graphics , a complete World Cup with qualifying rounds ( including all national teams ) and refined gameplay . Months later , World Cup 98 , was EA \\'s first officially licensed tournament game . John Motson was the first commentator for the FIFA series , and has worked alongside Ally McCoist , Andy Gray , Des Lynam , Mark Lawrenson and Chris Waddle . Motson first joined the franchise for FIFA 96 ; he and McCoist were replaced by Gray and Clive Tyldesley for FIFA 06 but later returned for FIFA Manager 08 . Martin Tyler was the default commentator for the FIFA series from 2006 to 2020 , alongside Andy Gray between 2006 and 2010 and Alan Smith from 2011 to 2020 . Derek Rae and Lee Dixon took over in FIFA 21 . FIFA games have been met with some minor criticism ; such as improvements each game features over its predecessor . As the console market expanded , FIFA was challenged directly by other titles , most notably Konami \\'s Pro Evolution Soccer ( PES ) series . The rivalry between both franchises since the 1990s has been considered the \" greatest rivalry \" in the history of sports video games . While FIFA initially had a more \" arcade-style \" approach , PES was more of a football simulation video game series with \" faster-paced tactical play \" and more varied emergent gameplay , which led to PES rivaling FIFA in sales during the 2000s . EA responded by borrowing gameplay elements from PES in order to improve FIFA , which led to FIFA pulling ahead commercially by a significant margin in the early 2010s . Both FIFA and Pro Evolution Soccer have a large following , but FIFA sales were rising by as much as 23 percent year-on-year in the early 2010s . By 2000 , the FIFA series had sold more than units worldwide , making it the best-selling association football video game series . In 2010 , the FIFA series had sold over 100 million copies , making it the best-selling sports video game franchise in the world and the most profitable EA Sports title . With FIFA 12 selling 3.2 million copies in the first week after its 27 September North American debut in 2011 , EA Sports dubbed it \" the most successful launch in EA Sports history \" . In 2012 , EA Sports signed Lionel Messi to the FIFA franchise , luring him away from the competitor Pro Evolution Soccer . Messi \\'s likeness was then immediately placed on the cover of FIFA Street . In 2013 , the Spanish professional women \\'s footballer Vero Boquete started a petition on Change.org , which called upon Electronic Arts to introduce female players in the FIFA series . The petition attracted 20,000 signatures in 24 hours . FIFA 16 , released on 25 September 2015 , included female national teams . In 2018 , Steve Boxer of The Guardian called FIFA 18 \" the slickest , most polished and by far the most popular football game around \" and \" football [ video ] games \\' equivalent of the Premier League \" . He praised the game \\'s FIFA Ultimate Team , which \" encourages you to purchase Panini-sticker-like player packs to build up a dream team \" , adding the series has \" an excellent Journey mode that lets you control an aspiring pro and build him up to an international superstar , and a Career mode that lets you control your favourite team on and off the field . \" One of the best-selling video game franchises , by 2021 , the FIFA series had sold over 325 million copies . The latest installments in the series contain many exclusively licensed leagues including leagues and teams from around the world , including the German Bundesliga and 2 . Bundesliga , English Premier League and EFL Championship , Italian Serie A and Serie B , Spanish La Liga and La Liga 2 , French Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , Portuguese Primeira Liga , Turkish Süper Lig , Dutch Eredivisie , Scottish Premiership , the Swiss Super League , Russian Premier League , Polish Ekstraklasa , Mexican Liga MX , American Major League Soccer , South Korean K-League , Japanese J1 League , the Chinese Super League , Saudi Professional League , Australian A-League , Chilean Primera División , Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro Série A and Argentine Liga Profesional de Fútbol , allowing the use of real leagues , clubs and player names and likenesses within the games . Popular clubs from around the world , including some teams from Greece , Ukraine and South Africa , are also included , without those nations \\' entire leagues . They are available in the \" Rest of World \" section . Games in the series 1990s FIFA International Soccer Cover athlete : David Platt and Piotr Świerczewski ( Packie Bonner and Ruud Gullit in some versions ) Released for : Mega Drive/Genesis , PC , DOS , Amiga , Sega CD ( as FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition ) , 3DO , SNES , Master System , Sega Game Gear , Game Boy Release dates : 15 December 1993 ( Mega Drive ) , 1994 ( ports ) Known as EA Soccer during development and sometimes subsequently also known as FIFA \\'94 , the first game in the series was released for the Sega Mega Drive in the weeks leading up to Christmas 1993 . This greatly hyped football title broke with traditional 16-bit era games by presenting an isometric view rather than the more usual top-down view ( Kick Off ) , side view ( European Club Soccer ) , or bird \\'s eye view ( Tehkan World Cup and Sensible Soccer ) . It only includes national teams , and real player names are not used . A notorious bug allows the player to score by standing in front of the goalkeeper so that the ball rebounds off him into the net . The game was number one in the UK charts , replacing Street Fighter II Special Champion Edition , and staying there for a full six months . Mega placed the game at # 11 in their Top 50 Mega Drive Games of All Time . The Sega Mega CD version was released under the title \" FIFA International Soccer Championship Edition \" it includes some features used in the next title , and is a highly polished version of the original . This version was ranked # 7 on the Mega list of the Top 10 Mega CD Games of All Time . The game on the 3DO console sported pseudo-3D cameras and it was the most graphically advanced version . Also , the game is playable on the PlayStation 2 version of FIFA 06 . It was made in celebration for the 1994 FIFA World Cup held in the United States – especially noticeable in the Super NES version which , despite having a smaller team selection than the Genesis version , had three exclusive teams which qualified for the real-life tournament : Bolivia , Saudi Arabia and South Korea . The game was called International Soccer so EA could sell the game successfully in Europe , after assuming Americans would have no interest in the game . FIFA 95 Cover athlete : Erik Thorstvedt ( Alexi Lalas in some versions ) Released for : Mega Drive/Genesis Release date : 10 November 1994 Using the same engine with only minor touch-ups , FIFA 95 introduced club teams to the series within eight national leagues : Brazil , Germany \\'s Bundesliga , Italy \\'s Serie A , Spain \\'s La Liga , England \\'s Premier League , France \\'s Ligue 1 , Netherlands \\' Eredivisie and the United States . Most of the leagues have team lineups based on the 1993–94 season , and the teams , although recognisably real , all still have generic players , many of them even returning from the previous game . The USA League consists of teams and players from the A-League , the country \\'s second division – subsequent editions would feature \" artificial \" division one leagues , a feature not corrected until the 2000 edition , when Major League Soccer was included for the first time . In addition , the Brazilian league contained only teams from São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states , with the exception of Internacional , from Rio Grande do Sul—it would not be until FIFA 07 that Campeonato Brasileiro represented the country . The game eliminates the one-touch passing seen in the original FIFA International Soccer . This was also the only game in the main series not to be released in more than one platform ( counting spin-offs , only FIFA 64 and certain versions of the FIFA Manager series share this distinction ) . FIFA 96 Cover athlete : Ioan Ovidiu Sabau and Jason McAteer ( European version ) Released for : DOS/Windows , PlayStation , Sega Saturn , Sega 32X , SNES , Mega Drive/Genesis , Sega Game Gear , Game Boy Release date : 30 September 1995 This is the first FIFA game to feature real-time 3D graphics on the Sega Saturn , PlayStation and PC versions , using technology called \" Virtual Stadium \" . It is also the first in the series to present players with real player names and positions , with ranking , transfer and team customisation tools . However , the Brazilian teams had mostly inaccurate rosters , some of them even featuring long-retired players ( this would only be corrected in FIFA 99 ) , and the American league consisted of entirely fictitious teams and rosters ( Major League Soccer had been inaugurated for only a few months as of the game \\'s release , but it would only start to appear in the games as of FIFA 2000 ) . The SNES and Mega Drive versions use an updated version of FIFA 95 \" \\'s engine with new teams and graphics . It is also the first FIFA game to contain a player/team editor ( in the Mega Drive and fifth-generation versions only ) . Also , in addition to the eight national leagues of the previous game , three leagues debuted in the game : Scottish Football League Premier Division , Allsvenskan and Super League Malaysia , a lineup that would stay for the next two editions as well . This was also the first FIFA game to have a proper introduction . FIFA 97 Cover athlete : David Ginola ( European version ) ; Bebeto ( rest of the world ) Released for : DOS/Windows , PlayStation , Sega Saturn , Mega Drive/Genesis , SNES , Game Boy Release date : 30 November 1996 The biggest change in FIFA \\'97 was the inclusion of 6-a-side indoor soccer mode and polygonal players , with motion capture provided by David Ginola . The game features a much higher number of playable leagues from England , Spain , France , Italy , the Netherlands , Germany and Malaysia . These versions also feature commentary by John Motson , partnered by Andy Gray , with Des Lynam introducing the matches . FIFA : Road to World Cup 98 Cover athlete : Roy Lassiter ( USA ) ; David Beckham ( UK ) ; Paolo Maldini ( Italy ) ; David Ginola ( France ) ; Andreas Möller ( Germany ) ; Raúl ( Spain ) Title song : \" Song 2 \" by Blur Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation , Nintendo 64 , Sega Saturn , SNES , Mega Drive/Genesis , Game Boy Release date : 8 November 1997 This game marks the start of an upward trend in the series . It boasts a refined graphics engine , team and player customisation options , 16 stadia , improved artificial intelligence , a \" Road to World Cup \" mode with all FIFA-registered national teams , and a licensed soundtrack featuring popular musical artists of the time . The game features many accurate team squads for national call up when playing in the round robin qualification modes . Another new feature was the ability to manually change the referee \\'s strictness , allowing some fouls to go un-noticed or without punishment . Additionally , for the first time in a FIFA game , the offside rule is properly implemented . In previous games , when a player was in an offside position doing anything except running , that player was penalised for offside even when the ball was passed backwards . The 32-bit version of FIFA 98 corrects this so that the game would only award a free kick for offside if the ball was passed roughly to where the player in the offside position was.FIFA 98 was also the first of the series to feature a licensed soundtrack , with \" Song 2 \" by Blur used as the intro track for the game . It was the last FIFA game to be released on the 16-bit consoles that the series had originated on . FIFA 99 Cover athlete : Dennis Bergkamp ( World ) , Kasey Keller ( USA ) , Fabien Barthez ( France ) , Hidetoshi Nakata ( Japan ) ; Olaf Thon ( Germany ) ; Rui Costa ( Portugal ) ; Christian Vieri ( Italy ) ; Ahn Jung-hwan ( South Korea ) ; Fernando Morientes ( Spain ) ; Jason Kreis ( USA beta ) Title song : \" The Rockafeller Skank ( Remix ) \" by Fatboy Slim Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation , Nintendo 64 Release date : 30 November 1998 . No description . FIFA 2000 Title song : \" It \\'s Only Us \" by Robbie Williams Cover athlete : Hidetoshi Nakata ( Japan ) ; Sol Campbell ( UK ) ; Vincenzo Montella ( Italy ) ; Pep Guardiola ( Spain ) ; Emmanuel Petit ( France ) ; Jaap Stam ( Netherlands ) ; Vassilios Tsiartas ( Greece ) ; Mehmet Scholl ( Germany ) ; Simão ( Portugal ) ; Eddie Pope ( US ) ; Raí ( Brazil ) ; Pär Zetterberg ( Sweden ) ; Đovani Roso ( Israel ) ; Kim Byung-ji ( South Korea ) ; Kiatisuk Senamuang ( Thailand ) ; Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation , Game Boy Color Release date : 26 October 1999 This version of the FIFA series contained over 40 \" classic \" teams , so that gamers could play as retired football legends . It marked the introduction of Major League Soccer , replacing the fictitious \" American \" league previously included , as well as national leagues from Denmark , Greece , Israel , Norway and Turkey ( though Galatasaray is not present in the game ) . The game features over 40 national sides , fully integrated seasons , set piece selections , increased physical contact , new facial animations , shielding ability and tougher tackling . The game received mixed reviews due to its cartoonish graphic engine and shallow gameplay , a brand new engine was implemented in an attempt to give more \" emotion \" to the 3D player models . The game was generally considered to be much inferior than its rival . The opening video for FIFA 2000 features Sol Campbell performing motion capture duties for the game , then having his likeness computer-generated to play against a retro side from 1904 , the year of the inauguration of FIFA . The game also included Port Vale , the club supported by Williams , in the \" Rest of the World \" section ( they were in the Football League First Division at the time , and while the concept of post-season promotion and relegation was introduced in this edition , teams from lower league tiers were only selectable starting with FIFA 2004 ) . 2000s FIFA 2001 Title song : \" Bodyrock \" by Moby Cover athlete : Edgar Davids ( Netherlands ) ; Paul Scholes ( UK ) ; Gheorghe Hagi ( Romania ) ; Ben Olsen ( US ) ; Ricardo Sá Pinto ( Portugal ) ; Gaizka Mendieta ( Spain ) ; Filippo Inzaghi ( Italy ) ; Lothar Matthäus ( Germany ) ; Thierry Henry ( France ) ; Leonardo ( Brazil ) ; Shimon Gershon ( Israel ) ; Ko Jong-soo ( South Korea ) Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 , PlayStation Release date : 8 November 2000 This title had a new graphics engine from FIFA Soccer World Championship which allows each team to have its own detailed kit , and for some players , their own unique faces . Doing away with ordinary coloured pennants as club emblems , the license includes official club emblems for the first time , although certain leagues , like the Dutch league , are unlicensed . Slightly tweakable physics made the game a modding favorite for its fan community . The game also includes the entire Austrian Bundesliga and Korean K-League as playable leagues for the first time , albeit removing the Portuguese Liga and the Turkish Premier League . A \" hack \" feature is included , where the player can press R1 to attempt an intentional foul , such a high sliding tackle . This title was the first game of the series with a power bar for shooting ( such a feature already existed in the Super NES version of the first game , but it was not in all versions of the game ) . FIFA 2001 was the first version ( for the PC ) that could be played online , which was revolutionary , and the first game in the franchise on a 6th generation video game console in USA and Europe . The PlayStation version of FIFA 2001 received a \" Gold \" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association ( ELSPA ) , indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom . FIFA Football 2002 Title song : \" 19-2000 ( Soulchild Remix ) \" by Gorillaz Cover athlete : Hidetoshi Nakata ( Japan ) ; Thierry Henry ( France , UK , USA ) ; Zlatan Ibrahimović ( Sweden ) ; Nuno Gomes ( Portugal ) ; Francesco Totti ( Italy ) ; Ruud van Nistelrooy ( Netherlands ) ; İlhan Mansız ( Turkey ) ; Gerald Asamoah ( Germany ) ; Lampros Choutos ( Greece ) ; Hong Myung-bo ( South Korea ) ; Sibusiso Zuma ( South Africa & Denmark ) ; Nawaf Al-Temyat ( Saudi Arabia ) ; Tomasz Radzinski ( US ) ; Roberto Carlos ( Brazil ) ; Iker Casillas ( Spain ) ; Tomasz Frankowski ( Poland ) ; Haim Revivo ( Israel ) Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 , GameCube , PlayStation Release date : 1 November 2001 For FIFA Football 2002 , power bars for passes were introduced , and dribbling reduced in order to attain a higher challenge level . The power bar can also be customised to suit the gamer \\'s preference . The game also includes club emblems for many more European clubs as well as for major Dutch clubs such as PSV , Ajax and Feyenoord , although there was no Dutch league of any kind ( they were under the \" Rest of World \" header ) . This game also features , for the first time , the Swiss Super League , at the cost of excluding the Greek League . A card reward system licensed from Panini was also introduced where , after winning a particular competition , a star player card is unlocked . There is also a bonus game with the nations that had automatically qualified for the 2002 World Cup ( France , Japan and South Korea ) , in which the player tries to improve the FIFA ranking of their chosen team by participating in international friendlies . Playing with other national teams will allow the player to play through their respective zones \\' qualifying rounds ( except for Oceania and Africa , whose confederations are not represented in full ) .FIFA Football 2002 was the final game in the main series to feature the Japanese national team , as the Japan Football Association would sell its exclusive rights to Konami during 2002 , thereby depriving not only FIFA , but all other football games in the market ( with the exception of EA \\'s World Cup spin-offs ) , from using its lineup and likeness ( Japanese players in foreign markets continued to be featured in the series , though ) until FIFA 17 . FIFA Football 2003 Cover athlete : Roberto Carlos , Ryan Giggs , and Edgar Davids ( in the United States , only Landon Donovan appeared ) Title song : \" To Get Down ( Fatboy Slim remix ) \" by Timo Maas Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube , PlayStation , Game Boy Advance , Mobile phone Release date : 5 November 2002FIFA Football 2003 added features completely new gameplay from the previous titles . EA revamped the outdated DirectX 7 graphics used in FIFA 2001 and 2002 , and introduced new graphics featuring more detailed stadia , players , and kits . Club Championship Mode was introduced with the feature of playing against 17 of Europe \\'s top clubs in their own stadia and the fans singing their unique chants and songs . A TV-style broadcast package gave highlights at half-time and full-time , as well as comprehensive analysis . One of the most anticipated new features was EA Sport \\'s \" Freestyle Control \" which allows the user to flick the ball on and lay it off to teammates . Other additions include greater likenesses of players such as Thierry Henry and Ronaldinho , as well as realistic player responses . An Xbox version was added to the Windows and PlayStation 2 , whereas the original PlayStation version was dropped . FIFA Football 2003 was also the first game in the series to use the EA Trax . EA Trax is the exclusive music menu system that has been used ever since in all FIFA titles . FIFA Football 2004 Cover athlete : Thierry Henry , Alessandro Del Piero and Ronaldinho Title song : \" Red Morning Light \" by Kings of Leon Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube , PlayStation , Game Boy Advance , Nokia N-Gage , Mobile phone Release date : 18 October 2003 While not adding much to the game engine , the biggest new inclusion in FIFA Football 2004 is secondary divisions , which allow the player to take lower ranked teams into the top leagues and competitions ( a promotion/relegation system was present since the 2000 edition , but none up until this one featured second-tier leagues ) . A new gameplay feature dubbed \" off the ball \" was introduced , which is the ability to simultaneously control two players , in order , for example , to move a second player into the box in anticipation of a pass . The online mode was touted as the main feature . Another key feature is \" Football Fusion \" , which allows owners of both FIFA 2004 and Total Club Manager 2004 to play games from TCM in FIFA 2004 . This is also the first FIFA game to feature Latin American club teams aside from those of the Brazilian League ; there are four from Mexico ( América , Toluca , Monterrey and UNAM ; a fifth team , Tigres UANL , is present only in the Game Boy Advance version ) and two from Argentina ( Boca Juniors and River Plate ) . The title sequence , featuring Ronaldinho , Thierry Henry and Alessandro Del Piero , was filmed at St James \\' Park , the home ground of Newcastle United . FIFA Football 2005 Cover athlete : Patrick Vieira , Fernando Morientes and Andriy Shevchenko ( in North America , Oswaldo Sánchez replaced Patrick Vieira ) Released for : Microsoft Windows , PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube , PlayStation , PlayStation Portable ( America only ) , Game Boy Advance , Nokia N-Gage , Gizmondo , Mobile phone Release date : 11 October 2004FIFA Football 2005 was released much earlier than the usual late October date to obtain a head start over Pro Evolution Soccer 4 and avoid clashing with EA Sports \\' own FIFA Street . The game features the return of the create-a-player mode , as well as an improved Career mode . The biggest difference compared to previous titles in the series is the inclusion of first-touch gameplay which provides gamers with the ability to perform real-life tricks and passes . It is also the first version to feature the full Mexican League . The game has no opening video , but its soundtrack is headlined by British DJ Paul Oakenfold , who composed the FIFA Theme especially for the game , using some sounds from the game such as artificial crowd noise and commentary . This was the last title released for the original PlayStation in the US . The game also features authentic crowd chants edited by producer Dan Motut . FIFA 06 Cover athlete : Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho ( in North America , Omar Bravo and Freddy Adu joined Ronaldinho on the cover ) Released for : GameCube , Microsoft Windows , Nintendo DS , PlayStation 2 , Xbox , Game Boy Advance , PlayStation Portable , Xbox 360 Release date : 4 October 2005FIFA \\'s developers made a complete overhaul of the game engine for this installment of FIFA , claiming a dramatic increase in the control of play , having rewritten more than half the game \\'s code . In addition to a renovation of the engine , which discards the \" off the ball \" system , the developers boasted a significantly more involved Career mode and the introduction of \" team chemistry \" which determines how well team members play together . This installment breaks with the long tradition of commentary from Match of the Day \\'s John Motson and ( more recently ) Ally McCoist , who are replaced by ITV \\'s Clive Tyldesley and former Sky Sports pundit Andy Gray , who had already worked in the series as guest commentator . One of the new features in FIFA 06 was a special \" retro \" which features nostalgia of the game . Inside it includes an unlockable classic biographies section , a memorable moments video compilation , which features ten of the most memorable moments as judged by the FIFA 06 developers , a video compilation with a retrospective view of every game in the FIFA series and the chance to play the first ever game in the FIFA series which was titled as \" FIFA 94 \" . The game also features for the first time a Classic XI team consisting of great football legends and a World XI team consisting of current great superstars . Both teams have the Cardiff Millennium Stadium as their primary ground . These clubs must be unlocked in the \" Fan Shop \" . The Xbox 360 version , titled FIFA 06 : Road to FIFA World Cup , featured only national teams and a brand-new engine taking advantage of the Xbox 360 \\'s graphical capabilities . It was the first FIFA game on a seventh-generation console . FIFA 07 Cover athlete : Wayne Rooney and Ronaldinho ( worldwide ) ; Ronaldinho and Lukas Podolski ( Germany ) ; Ronaldinho , Landon Donovan and Francisco Fonseca ( North America ) ; Ronaldinho and Juninho Pernambucano ( France ) ; Ronaldinho and David Villa ( Spain ) ; Kim Nam-il ( South Korea ) Released for : Microsoft Windows , Xbox 360 , PlayStation 2 , Xbox , GameCube , PlayStation Portable , Nintendo DS , Game Boy Advance , Java ME Release date : 27 September 2006 The main differences from the previous game are a new \" Interactive Leagues \" function , new stadia such as the new Wembley Stadium and Emirates Stadium , and the ability to create custom teams and Turkcell Super League returns after seven years of absence from the series . The game \\'s front-end and graphics engine remain largely the same . The Xbox 360 version uses a completely new game engine which was created from scratch for the system . This Xbox 360 version also features a much reduced team line-up , completely removing all lower division teams and focusing on the four main European leagues , plus the Mexican Clausura and national teams . This was the last title released for the GameCube , Xbox and Game Boy Advance . FIFA 08 Slogans : Can You FIFA 08 ?

This version also introduced a larger club section including the League of Ireland , and the Hyundai A-League of Australia , for the first time . Unlike FIFA 06 and 07 however , FIFA 08 does not include any memorable moments or season highlights . This edition introduced the Practice Arena Feature that allowed training and improving the dribbling , shooting , or practicing free kicks and penalties while on the practice pitch . It was the first game in the franchise for PlayStation 3 and Wii , the latter introducing motion controls for shooting , as well as three mini-games that make use of the Wii Remote .

Online play has also been improved in FIFA 09 , with a feature called \" FIFA 09 Clubs \" allowing players to form or join clubs and field their strongest team online . The game is the first in the FIFA series to feature user-controlled goal celebrations . FIFA 09 has met with generally positive reception from reviewers . Clive Tyldesley and Andy Gray again provide the commentary in the English version . However , in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game , Tyldesley is replaced by Martin Tyler . For the first time , users can also purchase extra commentator voices in different languages from the PlayStation Store ( PlayStation 3 ) and Xbox Live Marketplace ( Xbox 360 ) .

A prolific goalscorer known for his spectacular strikes and volleys , Sánchez is widely regarded as the greatest Mexican footballer of all time . In 1999 , the International Federation of Football History and Statistics voted Sánchez the 26th best footballer of the 20th century , and the best footballer from the CONCACAF region . In 2004 Sánchez was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . He is the fourth highest scorer in the history of La Liga , the third highest scoring foreign player after Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo , and is the seventh highest goalscorer in Real Madrid \\'s history . He scored a total of 562 senior career goals for both club and country in 956 matches . Sánchez began his career playing for Club Universidad Nacional in 1976 , and briefly went on loan to the San Diego Sockers of the North American Soccer League in 1979 . In 1981 , he moved to Spain to play for Atlético Madrid , playing for the Colchoneros for four years before moving to cross-town rivals Real Madrid , where he would spend the best years of his career , winning numerous titles and accolades .

He participated in three FIFA World Cup tournaments and was a part of the Mexico team that reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 World Cup . Famous for his acrobatic goal celebrations throughout his club and international career , Sánchez was the first notable exponent of the backflip . As a manager , he won two consecutive league championships with UNAM . After managing Necaxa , he was announced as coach of the Mexico national team in 2006 , but was fired in March 2008 due to poor results . In 2009 , Sánchez was named manager of Almería , and helped to save the club from relegation .

That year , Sánchez won his first Pichichi trophy for being the most prolific scorer in the league , scoring 26 goals . Real Madrid On 15 July 1985 , Sánchez signed for Real Madrid . It was reported that due to Atlético Madrid \\'s reluctance to anger their fan base with a direct deal with Real , Sánchez was transferred to UNAM back in his home country on 4 July before being signed by Real Madrid , with the contract signing taking place in a bank in Mexico City . He was flown back to Spain and presented to 50,000 fans at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 19 July .

Although the team went on to have a good campaign under his leadership , differences between the club president and Sánchez resulted in his sacking in August of that year .

After building his team up for a number of years , by 2004 Sánchez \\' Pumas had won everything they played in : Clausura 2004 , Apertura 2004 , Champion of Champions 2004 and the Santiago Bernabéu Cup . He also became the only manager in history to lead a Mexican team to two consecutive championships in the Mexican Primera División in the \" short tournament \" format . The success , however , was short lived . Pumas became the worst team of the tournament the following season and in Winter 2005 were having the worst year in its history . Sánchez decided to resign in November 2005 . Club Necaxa , another Mexican team , signed him as a head coach in 2006 , and he also became the coach of the Mexico national team that year following their participation at the 2006 FIFA World Cup . He became coach of La Liga \\'s Almería in early 2009 , but after accomplishing the goal of avoiding relegation from La Liga , and despite on 2 June 2009 the Almeria chairman Alfonso García announcing the renewal of his contract , he was released on 20 December 2009 . Mexico After briefly managing Club Necaxa , Sánchez was named head coach of the Mexico national team , with the aim of leading Mexico through the qualification process for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa . During his coaching career especially , Sánchez became known for his volatile temperament and his willingness to speak candidly , often expressing strong emotions and opinions , a trait that engenders equally emotional and strong responses from those he criticizes . He had a long-standing feud with the previous Mexico coach , Ricardo La Volpe . Sánchez \\'s first match as Mexico coach was a 2–0 loss to the United States in Phoenix , Arizona in February 2007 . Sánchez recorded his first victory against Venezuela , a 3–1 win in front of 67,000 fans in San Diego . Hugo \\'s first game in Mexico took place against Paraguay in Monterrey on 25 March 2007 , which Mexico won 2–1 . A few days later on 28 March 2007 , Mexico defeated Ecuador 4–2 in Oakland , California . In June 2007 Sánchez coached Mexico in the 2007 edition of the Gold Cup , his first official competition . After struggling in the first stages of the tournament , México reached the final 24 June 2007 and lost 2–1 against the US . On 27 June 2007 , in the opening game of the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela , Sánchez led the Mexico national team to a stunning 2–0 win Brazil , Hugo \\'s first major victory as a coach . After easing through the group stage of the tournament , Hugo led the team to the semi-finals ( beating Paraguay 6–0 in the quarter-finals ) where they were beaten 3–0 by Argentina . Mexico ended the tournament in third place by defeating Uruguay 3–1 . In August 2007 , Sánchez announced that Mexico would permanently , or at least in his time coaching the team , drop their famous green home kit , replacing it with their white away kit , meaning that their new away kit would be red . For this decision , Sánchez was subject of a lot of criticism . The two main arguments against him were that the decision was breaking a long-standing Mexican tradition , yet the strongest critics suggested that he should devote more time to the strategy and training of the Mexico team rather than entertaining himself with superfluous features of the sport . In March 2008 , Sánchez suffered poor results , including draws with Australia and Finland , and a loss at home in Querétaro against Ecuador \\'s U-23 team . Disappointing results continued in the CONCACAF Olympic Qualification , a draw with Canada and a loss to Guatemala . His only victory was a 5–1 win against Haiti . Mexico were eliminated from the Pre-Olympic qualifying tournament on goal difference . On 31 March 2008 , Hugo Sánchez was fired from his post as Mexican head coach . Style of play Nicknamed Hugol and Pentapichichi , Sánchez was a prolific goalscorer , who usually played as a centre-forward ; he is widely regarded as Mexico \\'s greatest-ever footballer , and one of the greatest players of his generation . A quick and mobile striker , with good skills and an eye for goal , he was known for his intelligence , positional sense , movement , and anticipation in the area , and was an accurate and efficient finisher , who was capable of scoring with few touches . Due to his athleticism , Sánchez was good in the air , despite his diminutive stature , and was also known for his ability to score acrobatic and flamboyant goals from spectacular strikes and volleys from any position on the pitch , both inside or outside the area ; his mastery of the \" Chilena \" , or \" Bicycle kick \" , was a result of his own early training in gymnastics , and his goals scored in this manner were later dubbed Huguinas . His trademark was to perform a celebratory somersault followed by a fist pump after each goal he scored , in honour of his sister , who was a gymnast and participated in the Montreal Olympics . Sánchez is considered to be the first noted exponent of the backflip . According to his FIFA profile , Sánchez is credited as the creator of the scorpion kick , which was later popularised by Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita . Though he regularly practised the trick in training , the Mexican striker never scored a goal with it in an official match . An accurate penalty taker , Sánchez held the record for most penalties scored in La Liga with 56 , until Cristiano Ronaldo broke the record in 2017 after scoring his 57th penalty-kick . Outside football Personal life Hugo Sánchez is the son of Héctor Sánchez , who was also a footballer who played for Asturias F.C . and Atlante . Sánchez is currently married to Isabel ( née Martín ) , and has two children , a son and an older daughter from his previous marriage . His son , Hugo Sánchez Portugal , was also a footballer and played for UNAM and Atlante . He also has two daughters from his current marriage . On 8 November 2014 , Sánchez Portugal died from the effects of a gas leak in a Mexico City apartment as stated by the Mexican Red Cross . In 2006 , Sánchez was appointed as the official FIFA/SOS Ambassador for Mexico , joining Wayne Rooney ( Ambassador for England ) , Ruud van Nistelrooy ( Netherlands ) , and fifty others in fund raising for the official 2006 FIFA World Cup Charity . On 1 September 2007 , Sánchez inaugurated a street with his name in Puebla , central Mexico , before a thousand of the locals around there . Media As of January 2015 , Sánchez is a commentator for ESPN in Mexico and the United States . He had previously served as a guest analyst during their coverage of the 2014 FIFA World Cup before featuring as a regular analyst .

It is located on the Sura River , southeast of Moscow . As of the 2010 Census , Penza had a population of 517,311 , making it the 38th-largest city in Russia . Geography Urban layout This central quarter occupies the territory on which the wooden fortress Penza was once located , therefore it is sometimes called the Serf . The architectural concept of the old fortress , erected on the eastern slope of the mountain above the river , predetermined the direction of the first streets . The direction and location of the first streets were set by the passage towers of the fortress and the orientation of its walls . This is how the first six streets of the city were formed . Subsequently , the names were fixed to them : Governor \\'s , Lekarskaya , Moscow , Nikolskaya , Sadovaya and Teatralnaya . An important element of the urban development of the city is that the square of the fortress created a network of streets converging at right angles . Initially , there was no proper harmony in them . Often the difficult terrain of the area forced the direction and width of the road to change . Here and there , spontaneous development took shape . Nevertheless , the urban planning matrix was created and predetermined the development of the city for several centuries . During the reign of Empress Catherine the Great , the first general plan of Penza was drawn up , it was approved on October 6 , 1785 . The city was rebuilt anew in accordance with the rectilinear structure of St . Petersburg . The plan of the city , in its central part practically did not change , as it fully complied with the new norms of Russian urban planning . The mutually perpendicular orientation of the streets and the accompanying division of the urban environment into standard quarters was the original and distinctive feature of Penza . Perhaps Penza owes this to its first builders , who are well acquainted with the European urban planning trends of the 17th century - the German Joseph von Sommer ( Lieutenant Colonel of the Moscow Service Osip Zumerovsky ) and the Polish nobleman Yuri Kotransky . At the end of the next 18th century , in the process of implementing Catherine \\'s master plan for Penza , only some sections of the old streets were straightened , the standard width of the roadway and sidewalks was set . The redevelopment of the city was preceded by the resettlement of the serving suburban population from the center to suburban villages and wastelands . Newly carved quarters of the Upland part of the city , more comfortable for living , were inhabited by the nobility and eminent merchants . Initially , the fortress was not only a defense complex , but also the administrative center of a vast region . On that place the governor , archives , treasury , prison , arsenal and other instruments of the regional statehood were settled . In the fortress there was the main cathedral of the region – Spassky and the main square of the city – Cathedral . In accordance with the General Plan of 1785 , the dilapidated fortress , trading rows and philistine buildings adjacent to its walls were dismantled . As a result of clearing , the posadskaya Nikolskaya church came out of the environment of spontaneous buildings and acquired a harmonious look , becoming a true decoration of the city . For several years , on the territory of the central quarter and adjacent streets , state-owned stone buildings were complexly erected : the bishop \\'s courtyard , the governor \\'s residence , the assembly of the nobility and two buildings of public places ( 7.1 and 7.4 ) . ) By the beginning of the 20th century , private residential There are no buildings left in the Fortress Quarter of the city . In the Fortress Quarter there is also a special administrative street of the city – the Line of Public Places , passing from Sadovaya to Moskovskaya , bypassing the Spassky Cathedral . It has never had and still does not have residential buildings . the eastern earthen rampart of the old Penza fortress The ancient defensive rampart runs along the western side of Kirov Street ( on this section , Kirov Street was formerly called Teatralnaya Street ) . History Penza was founded as a Russian frontier fortress-city , and to this day , remnants of the Lomovskaya sentry line built in 1640 have been preserved at the western edge of the city , and remains of earth ramparts dating from the mid-16th century are preserved in the city center . Until 1663 , Penza was a wooden stockade with only a small settlement . In May 1663 , the architect Yuri Kontransky arrived in Penza on the Tsar \\'s orders to direct the construction of a fortress city , as part of a wider fortress building program to protect Russia from attacks by Crimean Tatars . The initial construction consisted of a wooden Kremlin , a village , and quarters for the nobility , small tradesmen , and merchants . The Muscovite government placed the Cossacks here , who constructed a fortress and called it \" Cherkassy Ostroh \" , from which the regional city of Penza has developed , thanks to the arrival of new settlers , particularly Russians . The Cossack roots of the city and its first settlers are now remembered in the names of Cherkasskaya street , along with the \" Cherkassy \" historical district . In 1774 , the insurgent army led by Yemelyan Pugachev occupied Penza after the citizens of the city welcomed the rebellious Cossacks . The first stone houses started to appear after 1801 , and by 1809 Penza \\'s population had grown to more than 13,000 people . In 1918 , Vladimir Lenin sent a telegram to communists in the Penza area , complaining about the \" insurrection of five kulak districts \" . He urged the public hanging of 100 \" landlords , richmen , bloodsuckers \" , grain seizure , and hostage-taking . This telegram has been used in several historical works on the period and on Lenin . During the Russian Civil War , the Czechoslovak Legions launched an anti-Bolshevik uprising in Penza . During the Soviet period , the city developed as a regional industrial center . The Ural mainframe was made here between 1959 and 1964 . Administrative and municipal status Penza is the administrative center of the oblast .

and author . Regarded as the best-known Spanish-language news anchor in the United States of America , he has been referred to as \" The Walter Cronkite of Latin America \" . Based in Miami , Florida , he anchors the Univision news television program Noticiero Univision , the Univision Sunday-morning political news program Al Punto , and the Fusion TV English-language program America with Jorge Ramos . He has covered five wars , and events ranging from the fall of the Berlin Wall to the War in Afghanistan . Ramos has won ten Emmy Awards and the Maria Moors Cabot Prize for excellence in journalism . He has also been included on Time magazine \\'s list of \" The World \\'s Most Influential People \" . Childhood Life Jorge Gilberto Ramos Ávalos was born on March 16 , 1958 in Mexico City , Mexico , to a Roman Catholic family , and he was raised in the Bosques de Echegaray neighborhood of Naucalpan , a suburb of Mexico City . His father was an architect . He attended Catholic schools where he states he was abused by the priests . Ramos graduated from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City where he majored in communications . Ramos has a Master \\'s degree in International Studies from the University of Miami . In 2007 , the University of Richmond conferred an honorary Doctor of Letters on him . Career Ramos worked for Grupo Televisa \\'s flagship XEW-TV in Mexico City for the network \\'s local version of 60 Minutes . At the age of 24 , he quit that job after a story he produced that was critical of Mexico \\'s government was censored . In 1983 , he left Mexico on a student visa for Los Angeles , where he planned to enroll in the UCLA Extension \\'s journalism classes . In 1984 , he was hired by KMEX-TV , an affiliate of what was then the Spanish International Network ( SIN ) in Los Angeles , which operated on a shoestring budget in a run-down facility on Melrose Avenue . At KMEX , Ramos felt he could express himself freely : \" To me it was a palace ... the United States gave me opportunities that my country of origin could not : freedom of the press and complete freedom of expression . \" Three years later , he became the host for KMEX \\'s morning program , Mundo Latino . In 1987 , Ramos then joined SIN \\'s national operation which was rebranded as the Univision network a year later after coming under new ownership ; Univision has a broad entertainment and news-sharing agreement with Televisa . Since 1987 , Ramos has been the anchorman for Noticiero Univision , a nightly Spanish language newscast , alongside colleague María Elena Salinas . He also hosts Al Punto , a Spanish-language Sunday public affairs program aired weekly on Univision , and America with Jorge Ramos , an English language news magazine on Fusion TV . In 1989 , as he watched the fall of the Berlin Wall , Ramos has said he remembered thinking , \" This is why I am what I am ! \" Other world events he covered include the Salvadoran Civil War , the Persian Gulf War , the disintegration of the former Soviet Union , and the 9/11 terrorist attacks . During the United States \\'s War in Afghanistan , Ramos traveled there on his own while on vacation because his network refused to send him . Throughout his career he has covered five wars . As of 2014 , KMEX-DT his Univision 34 news shows regularly beat their English language competition among young viewers . He has interviewed multiple world leaders including Barack Obama , George W . Bush , Bill Clinton , George H . W . Bush , Fidel Castro , Daniel Ortega and Hugo Chávez . Ramos also writes a bilingual newspaper column that is published internationally , and appears regularly as a pundit on English-language cable networks , like CNN and MSNBC . Polls among American Latinos rank him as the most trusted and influential Hispanic in America , surpassing all other political leaders , and his Q Score among Latino audiences places him between soccer star Lionel Messi and pop singer Shakira . In 2002 , he founded Despierta Leyendo ( Wake Up Reading ) , the first book club in the history of Spanish-language television . On February 21 , 2008 , he represented Univision in a Democratic debate between Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama on The University of Texas at Austin campus in Austin , Texas . In 2012 , Ramos , critical of the lack of Latino moderators in any of the U.S . presidential debates , complained that the debate commission was \" stuck in the 1950s \" . When Univision held its own forums with candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney , Ramos challenged both of them on their immigration policies , specifically Romney \\'s \" self-deportation \" policy , which Ramos considered an insult to Latinos , and Obama \\'s deportation of more than 1.4 million people , and his reneging on his promise to address immigration during his first term . Washington Monthly named Ramos the broadcaster who would most determine the 2012 presidential election . Ramos \\' increased notability , however , led to criticism of his advocacy approach . To this Ramos has stated , \" Our position is clearly pro-Latino or pro-immigrant ... We are simply being the voice of those who do n\\'t have a voice . \" In 2015 , after Donald Trump became a presidential candidate , Ramos pursued an interview with Trump for months . When he sent Trump a handwritten request in June , Trump , who had filed a lawsuit against Univision over its decision to drop the Miss Universe pageant following the candidate \\'s comments about Mexican immigrants , posted Ramos \\'s letter on Instagram , which exposed Ramos \\'s cell phone number . Trump later deleted the post . On August 25 , 2015 , Ramos attended a news conference held in Dubuque , Iowa , by Trump . Prior to attending , Ramos studied previous Trump press conferences and discovered a pattern of Trump repetitively interjecting \" excuse me \" and calling on another reporter when asked a question opposing his beliefs . Due to this knowledge , Ramos refused to sit down and persistently continued questioning Trump about his immigration policies when rebuffed . Ramos insisted on his rights as a reporter and United States citizen to ask a question , prompting Trump \\'s Head of Security Keith Schiller to push him backwards out of the conference room . About 15 minutes later , Trump allowed Ramos to return to the conference , where he and Trump engaged in a heated exchange on the issue . Trump later explained that he had not called on Ramos for a question , as he had called on another reporter in the audience . Ramos accused Trump of \" spreading hate \" with his calls for mass deportations of undocumented families , and repealing birthright citizenship , and questioned the feasibility of Trump \\'s proposals . He also questioned Trump \\'s viability as a candidate among Latino voters , citing a poll indicating that 75 % of those voters held unfavorable opinions of him , and projected that Trump would only get 16 % of the Latino vote . Election exit polls showed Trump getting 29 % of the Hispanic vote , a 13 % increase over Ramos \\'s projection . Most Latinos did not vote though . Latino turnout was actually under 50 % , even lower than the historically low election turnout overall . It was higher in the prior election since Obama was running . The press conference incident inspired Ramos to create his documentary Hate Rising focused on increasing incidents of racial bigotry and violence across the country , which aired October 23 , 2016 , on Univision and Fusion . In preparation for the documentary , Ramos met with members of various hate groups across the country including Ku Klux Klan members and neo-Nazis , along with Latino and Muslim victims . His journey lasted nine months , often placing him in danger as both an immigrant and a Mexican-American man . In order to gain face time with members of white supremacist groups , Ramos partnered with director Catherine Tambini , an American who the groups were under the impression they would be speaking to , and only right before the interview started did Ramos sit down to ask questions . In 2016 , Ramos began leveraging Facebook Live to stream raw footage taken on his phone to social media audiences , gaining 2.6 million views on his Iowa caucus videos and over four million on his reports during the New Hampshire primaries . On February 25 , 2019 , he was held with his journalistic group in the Miraflores Palace after an interview with Nicolás Maduro . After seizing the equipment and interview recordings , he was released hours later and deported from the country . During the interview , Maduro denied there was a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela , which led Ramos to show Maduro images of Venezuelans eating garbage to point out that there was indeed a crisis . After being released , Ramos stated that he and his group were held because this action bothered Maduro . The Information Minister of Maduro , Jorge Rodríguez , described the incident as a \" cheap show . \" On April 12 , 2019 , his intervention in the morning conference of Mexican president Andrés Manuel López Obrador was controversial over the confrontation he held with López Obrador , around homicide figures in Mexico in the period of the administration . The episode opened a debate on the use of figures of malicious homicides in Mexico and its different sources . He interviewed Fidel Castro , confronted Obama on deportations , confronted Trump and is reportedly an admirer of Oriana Fallaci .

During his playing career , Batistuta was nicknamed Batigol ( ) as well as El Ángel Gabriel ( ; Spanish for Angel Gabriel ) . Regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time , noted in particular for powerful strikes from volleys or from distance while on the run , in 1999 , Batistuta placed third for the FIFA World Player of the Year award . In 2004 , he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . After beginning his career in Argentina in 1988 with Newell \\'s Old Boys , followed by River Plate and Boca Juniors where he won titles , the prolific striker played most of his club football with Serie A club Fiorentina in Italy ; he is their all-time top scorer in Serie A with 151 goals . When Fiorentina was relegated to Serie B in 1993 , Batistuta stayed with the club and helped them return to the top-flight league a year later . He became an icon in Florence ; the Fiorentina fans erected a life-size bronze statue of him in 1996 , in recognition of his performances for the club . Despite winning the Coppa Italia and the Supercoppa Italiana with the club in 1996 , he never won the Serie A title with Fiorentina , but when he moved to Roma in 2000 for €36 million – the highest fee ever paid for a player over the age of 30 until Cristiano Ronaldo moved from Real Madrid to Juventus in 2018– he won the 2000–01 Serie A title . After a brief loan spell with Inter Milan in 2003 , he played his last two seasons in Qatar with Al-Arabi before he retired in 2005 . At international level , Batistuta was Argentina \\'s all-time leading goalscorer with 54 goals in 77 official matches , a record he held until 21 June 2016 , when he was surpassed by Lionel Messi . He participated in three FIFA World Cups , scoring 10 goals , making him Argentina \\'s all-time top scorer in the competition , and the joint eighth-highest World Cup goalscorer of all time . Batistuta is the only player in football history to score two hat-tricks in different World Cups . With the Argentina national team he won two consecutive Copa América titles ( 1991 and 1993 ) , the 1993 Artemio Franchi Trophy , and the 1992 FIFA Confederations Cup . Early and personal life Batistuta was born on 1 February 1969 to slaughterhouse worker Omar Batistuta and school secretary Gloria Zilli , in the town of Avellaneda , , but grew up in the nearby city of Reconquista . He has three younger sisters , Elisa , Alejandra , and Gabriela . Batistuta is a Roman Catholic . At the age of 16 , he met Irina Fernández , his future wife , at her quinceañera , a rite of passage on her 15th birthday . On 28 December 1990 , they were married at Saint Roque Church . The couple moved to Florence , Italy , in 1991 , and a year later their first son , Thiago , was born . Thanks to good performances in the Italian championship and with the Argentina national team , Batistuta gained fame and respect . He filmed several commercials and was invited onto numerous TV shows , but in spite of this , Batistuta always remained a low-profile family man . In 1997 , Batistuta \\'s second son , Lucas , was born , and a third son , Joaquín , followed in 1999 . He now has a fourth son Shamel . In 2000 , Batistuta and his family moved to Rome , where he played for Roma . Two years after Shamel was born , Batistuta was loaned to Inter . In 2003 , after 12 years in Italy , the family moved to Qatar where Batistuta had accepted a lucrative celebrity playing contract with a local team , Al-Arabi , ending his career there in 2005 . He moved back to Argentina in 2007 . Despite having completed his coaching badges in Argentina , he currently has no involvement with football , instead ( primarily as he has difficulty walking ) he prefers to play polo and golf , he was quoted saying \\' I do n\\'t like football , it \\'s only my job \\' . In later interviews with FIFA he expanded , “ I lived and breathed football ” , adding , “ when I was playing football I never enjoyed it that much , I was never happy ... if I scored two goals , I wanted a third , I always wanted more . Now it \\'s all over I can look back with satisfaction , but I never felt that way when I was playing . ” In 2006 he expressed an interest in coaching Australia \\'s national team and Argentina \\'s team . During the 2006 FIFA World Cup he worked as a commentator for Televisa Deportes . Batistuta currently runs his own construction company in Argentina . He also worked as technical secretary in the professional football club Colón , joining the club \\'s staff in January 2012 , and leaving at the end of the 2012–13 season . Speaking in a television interview in Argentina in 2014 , Batistuta said the pain suffered in his ankles after retiring in 2005 became so intense that he \" urinated in bed with the toilet only a few steps away . I could n\\'t move . \" He visited a doctor he knew asking his legs be amputated , but the doctor turned down his request . Although he later underwent surgery to relieve the pressure on his cartilage and tendons , and his condition improved slightly , in a 2017 interview he stated that he still had difficulty walking and faced mobility issues as a result of the stresses and injuries he faced throughout his football career due to overexerting himself . He has however still been able to take part in charity football games , and in 2014 he scored twice – one a trademark finish with a powerful 35 yard strike into the roof of the net – in a game in Italy . Batistuta currently lives in Perth , Western Australia . Club career Early career As a child , Batistuta preferred other sports to football . Because of his height he played basketball , but after Argentina \\'s victory in the 1978 FIFA World Cup , in which he was particularly impressed by the skills of Mario Kempes , he devoted himself to football . After playing with friends on the streets and in the small Grupo Alegria club , Batistuta joined the local Platense junior team . While with Platense he was selected for the Reconquista team that won the provincial championship following victory over Newell \\'s Old Boys . Batistuta \\'s two goals drew the attention of the opposition team ’ s coach Marcelo Bielsa , and he signed a professional contract with Newell ’ s in 1988 . Newell \\'s Old Boys At Newell \\'s Old Boys under Bielsa , who would later become Batistuta \\'s national coach with the Argentina national team , things did not come easily for him during his first year with the club . He was away from home , his family , and his girlfriend Irina , sleeping in a room at the stadium , and had a weight problem that slowed his progress . At the end of that year , Batistuta was loaned to a smaller team , Deportivo Italiano , with whom he participated in the Carnevale Cup in Italy , ending as top scorer with three goals . Under the guidance of Bielsa , whom Batistuta described in his autobiography as the most important coach he has ever had , and “ the one who taught me how to train on rainy days , he taught me everything ” , he was physically transformed , fed encouragement , and was set on the path into the player he was to become . River Plate In mid-1989 , Batistuta made the leap to one of Argentina \\'s biggest clubs , River Plate , where he scored 17 goals . He was drawn out of the team by the new manager Daniel Passarella in the mid-season , apparently with no specific reason . According to Batistuta , they never had a dispute . Passarella declared at that time \" when Batistuta finds a team that be able to play to him he will be lethal \" and highlighted his professionalism . Boca Juniors In 1990 , Batistuta joined River Plate \\'s arch rivals , Boca Juniors . He initially found it hard to find his best form , in part not playing in his position . However , at the beginning of 1991 , Óscar Tabárez became Boca Juniors \\' new manager and he gave Batistuta the support and put him into his best place in the field , the centre of attack , rather than as an outside forward . Batistuta finished the season as the league \\'s top scorer as Boca Juniors won the championship . Fiorentina While playing for Argentina in the 1991 Copa América , the vice-president of Fiorentina was impressed by Batistuta \\'s skills and signed him . He had a fine start in Serie A , scoring 13 goals in his debut season . However , the following season , in 1992–93 , Fiorentina lost in the relegation battle and were demoted to Serie B , despite Batistuta \\'s 16 league goals . The club returned to Serie A after one season in Serie B , with the contribution of 16 goals from Batistuta and the management of Claudio Ranieri , as Fiorentina captured the 1993–94 Serie B title . At Fiorentina , Batistuta found his best form . He was the top scorer of the 1994–95 Serie A season with 26 goals , and he broke Ezio Pascutti \\'s 32-year-old record by scoring in all of the first 11 matches of the season . In the 1995–96 season , Batistuta , alongside Rui Costa and Francesco Baiano , helped the club to go on a 15-match unbeaten run , as they eventually ended the season with a fourth-place league finish . Fiorentina also won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana over A.C . Milan ; in the two-legged Coppa Italia final against Atalanta , Batistuta scored a goal in each fixture as Fiorentina won 3–0 on aggregate . The next season was less successful , as Fiorentina finished in a disappointing ninth place in the league , although the team managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup , losing out to eventual champions Barcelona , despite scoring a goal in a 1–1 away draw in the first leg . Scoring over 20 league goals in each of the next three seasons – made all the more impressive given Serie A was the strongest league in the world and the hardest to score in with the best defences – as well as spectacular powerful strikes against Arsenal and Manchester United in the UEFA Champions League , Batistuta came third for FIFA World Player of the Year in 1999 . Batistuta and Ronaldo were the two best strikers in Serie A , with their duels the most anticipated in Italy . After his failure to win the Italian championship with Fiorentina , Batistuta started considering a transfer to a bigger team . In an effort to keep Batistuta , Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and promised to do everything to win the Scudetto . After an excellent start to the season , Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month . Losing momentum , Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place , although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season . In addition to the fans erecting a life-size bronze statue of him in Florence , Bastituta was inducted into the club ’ s hall of fame in 2014 . An emotional Batistuta told the audience at the ceremony : “ From the moment I arrived at Fiorentina I wanted a place in the history of the club – and now I can say I have succeeded . ” Roma Batistuta stayed at Fiorentina for the 1999–2000 season , tempted by the chance of winning both the Scudetto and the Champions League . After a promising start in both competitions , the team only reached seventh in the league and were eliminated in the second round group phase of the European tournament . The following season , he was transferred to Roma in a deal worth 70 billion lire ( €36.2 million ) and signed a three-year contract , which earned 14.8 billion Italian lire ( €7.6 million ) per year before tax . The fee paid for Batistuta became the highest fee ever paid for a player over the age of 30 . The record was broken in 2017 when Leonardo Bonucci was signed by A.C . Milan on a five-year contract for a €42 million fee . During the 2000–01 season , Batistuta finally garnered a Serie A winners \\' medal , scoring 20 league goals , as Roma clinched the Scudetto for the first time since 1983 , including a goal in the 3–1 title-deciding victory over Parma on 17 June 2001 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome . On 26 November 2000 Batistuta scored an 83rd-minute winner with a right-foot volley from 30 yards in a league game against Fiorentina in Rome – visibly upset having done so he refused to celebrate with his Roma teammates . Before the match he ran over to the 3,000 Fiorentina fans and saluted them , and did the same at full time , receiving adoration in return , before he left the stadium in tears . Sean Ingle , match reporter for The Guardian , wrote , “ Batistuta breaks Florentine hearts , and his own . ” The following season with Roma , he changed his shirt number from 18 to 20 in reference to the number of goals he had scored during the Scudetto winning campaign . He also wore his age on the back of his Roma shirt in 2002 , number 33 . Loan to Inter Milan Now aged 34 , Batistuta failed to find form with Roma and was loaned out to Inter Milan , scoring two goals in twelve matches , although he did provide assists for Christian Vieri . Batistuta sought a move to England to play with Fulham , but the deal never transpired . Al-Arabi He departed Italy for Qatar in 2003 , joining Al-Arabi on a free transfer in a deal worth $ 8 million . Batistuta ended the season by netting 25 goals , thus surpassing the record for most goals scored , which was previously held by Qatari legend Mansour Muftah . Batistuta announced his retirement in 2005 . International career In 1991 , Batistuta was selected to play for Argentina in the Copa América held in Chile , where he finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals as Argentina romped to victory . The following year , he won the FIFA Confederations Cup with Argentina , finishing as the tournament \\'s top-scorer . In 1993 , Batistuta played in his second Copa América , this time held in Ecuador , which Argentina won with Batistuta scoring both goals in a 2–1 win over Mexico in the final . The 1994 World Cup , held in the United States , was a disappointment . After a promising start Argentina were beaten by Romania in the last 16 . The morale of the team was seriously affected by Diego Maradona \\'s doping suspension . Despite the disappointing Argentine exit , Batistuta scored four goals in as many games , including a hat-trick in their opening game against Greece . During the qualification matches for the 1998 World Cup ( with former River Plate manager Daniel Passarella ) Batistuta was left out of the majority of the games after falling out with the coach over team rules . The two eventually put the dispute aside and Batistuta was recalled for the tournament . In the game against Jamaica , he recorded the second hat-trick of his World Cup career , becoming the fourth player to achieve this ( the others were Sándor Kocsis , Just Fontaine , and Gerd Müller ) and the first to score a hat-trick in two World Cups . Argentina were knocked out of the World Cup by the Netherlands courtesy of a last minute Dennis Bergkamp winner after the two sides had held out for a 1–1 draw for almost the entire match . After a good series of performances by Argentina in the qualification matches for the 2002 World Cup , hopes were high that the South Americans – now managed by Marcelo Bielsa – could win the trophy , and Batistuta announced that he planned to quit the national team at the end of the tournament , which Argentina aimed to win . But Argentina \\'s \" group of death \" saw the team fall at the first hurdle , only managing a victory against Nigeria ( Batistuta scored the match \\'s only goal ) . They later fell to England 1–0 and managed a mere 1–1 tie against Sweden . This meant that the team was knocked out in the opening round for the first time since 1962 . With 54 goals from 77 games , Batistuta was the record goalscorer for Argentina , a record he held until it was surpassed by Lionel Messi in 2016 . Batistuta admitted he was a little annoyed at losing the record , stating , “ You go around the world and people say , \\'he \\'s the top scorer for the Argentina national team ’ , before he then added , “ But the advantage I have is that I \\'m second to an extraterrestrial . \" Style of play A quick , hard-working , and powerful player , with an eye for goal and a good all-round game , Batistuta is considered one of the most complete , feared and prolific striker of his generation . As a striker , he was primarily known for his technique , offensive movement off the ball , strength in the air , and powerful , clinical finishing ability with both feet from anywhere on the pitch , despite being naturally right-footed . Batistuta also possessed an excellent positional sense , as well as an ability to anticipate defenders in the area , score acrobatic goals from volleys or bicycle kicks , and strike the ball first time from tight angles while on the run . He was also highly regarded due to his accurate heading and powerful free-kick taking abilities ; although he was a competent penalty taker , his conversion rate from the spot throughout his career was less reliable , however . In addition to his skill and goalscoring abilities , Batistuta frequently stood out on the pitch throughout his career due to his leadership and fair-play . Diego Maradona stated that Batistuta is the best striker he has ever seen play the game . Batistuta ’ s goal celebration – both arms upturned with his fists clenched – features in his statue placed next to those of Maradona and Messi in an emblematic square in the Recoleta district of Buenos Aires . Batistuta also often celebrated a goal by pretending he was firing a machine gun . Batistuta suffered several injuries throughout his career , which often limited his playing time and fitness , in particular in his later career , which would eventually force him to retire .

Popularly dubbed O Fenômeno ( \" The Phenomenon \" ) , and also nicknamed R9 , he is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time . As a multi-functional striker who brought a new dimension to the position , Ronaldo has been the influence for a generation of strikers that have followed . His individual accolades include being named FIFA World Player of the Year three times , and winning two Ballon d\\'Or awards . Ronaldo started his career at Cruzeiro and moved to PSV in 1994 . He joined Barcelona in 1996 for a then world record transfer fee , and at 20 years old he was named the 1996 FIFA World Player of the Year , making him the youngest recipient of the award . In 1997 , Inter Milan broke the world record fee to sign Ronaldo , making him the first player since Diego Maradona to break the world transfer record twice . At 21 he received the 1997 Ballon d\\'Or , and he remains the youngest recipient of the award . By the age of 23 , Ronaldo had scored over 200 goals for club and country , however after a series of knee injuries and recuperation he was inactive for almost three years . Ronaldo joined Real Madrid in 2002 and won the 2002–03 La Liga title . He had spells at AC Milan and Corinthians before retiring in 2011 having suffered further injuries . Ronaldo played for Brazil in 98 matches , scoring 62 goals , and is the third-highest goalscorer for his national team . At age 17 , he was the youngest member of the Brazilian squad that won the 1994 FIFA World Cup . At the 1998 FIFA World Cup , Ronaldo received the Golden Ball for player of the tournament , helping Brazil reach the final where he suffered a convulsive fit hours before kick-off . He won the 2002 FIFA World Cup where he starred in a front three with Ronaldinho and Rivaldo . Ronaldo scored twice in the final , and received the Golden Boot as the tournament \\'s top goalscorer .

He also won the 1997 Copa América , where he was player of the tournament , and the 1999 Copa América , where he was top goalscorer . One of the most marketable sportsmen in the world during his playing career , the first Nike Mercurial boots–R9–were commissioned for Ronaldo in 1998 . He was named in the FIFA 100 list of the greatest living players compiled in 2004 by Pelé , and was inducted into the Brazilian Football Museum Hall of Fame , Italian Football Hall of Fame , Inter Milan Hall of Fame and Real Madrid Hall of Fame . In 2020 , Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team , a greatest all-time XI published by France Football magazine . In retirement from sport , Ronaldo has continued his work as a United Nations Development Programme Goodwill Ambassador , a position to which he was appointed in 2000 . He served as an ambassador for the 2014 FIFA World Cup . Ronaldo became the majority owner of Real Valladolid in September 2018 , after buying 51 % of the club \\'s shares . In December 2021 he bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro , investing $ 70 million in the club . Early life Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima was born on 18 September 1976 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , the third child of Nélio Nazário de Lima , Snr . and Sônia dos Santos Barata . Ronaldo has a brother , Nélio Jr . His parents separated when he was 11 , and Ronaldo dropped out of school shortly afterward to pursue a career in football . He played on the streets of Bento Ribeiro , a suburb of Rio de Janeiro . His mother states , \" I always found him on the street playing ball with friends when he should have been in school . I know , I lost my battle . \" He joined Social Ramos athletic indoor futsal team at the age of 12 , and led the city youth league in scoring with a record 166 goals in his first season which included scoring 11 of his team \\'s 12 goals in a single game . Crediting futsal for developing his skills , Ronaldo has said , \" futsal will always be my first love . \" His coach from Social Ramos , Alirio Carvalho , says : \" What was special about Ronaldo was his attitude . It was as if he had come from the moon . Nothing disturbed him , nothing overawed him , nothing threw him off his game . \" Spotted by former Brazilian player Jairzinho , who was coaching São Cristóvão , Ronaldo played for the São Cristóvão youth team where he showcased his talents on the field . Under the guidance of coach Alfredo Sampaio , he progressed quickly through the ranks , playing for the clubs \\' under-17 and under-20 teams while only 15 . Ronaldo \\'s agents in Brazil , Reinaldo Pitta and Alexandre Martins , signed him as a 13-year-old . Pitta stated , \" We saw right away that he could be something different than most other players . \" Recognized as a child prodigy , Jairzinho recommended the then 16-year-old to his former club Cruzeiro . Club career Cruzeiro Ronaldo quickly attracted attention from big clubs , and his agents rejected offers from Botafogo and São Paulo , before receiving an offer of €50,000 from Cruzeiro , where he scored four goals on his youth team début . Three months after arriving , he made his professional debut on 25 May 1993 against Caldense in the Minas Gerais State Championship . Ronaldo came to national public attention on 7 November 1993 , scoring five goals in the game against Bahia . His first senior goal came in a friendly during a tour of Portugal , scoring a goal against Belenenses and generally impressing new coach Carlos Alberto Silva , enough to become a first team regular . During the tour , his performance against Porto impressed enough that they bid $ 500,000 , which was turned down by club president César Masci . Upon returning from the tour , he scored 20 goals , with eight coming in the Supercopa Libertadores , including a hat-trick against Chilean side Colo-Colo in the first leg , and two in the second leg , before scoring a further three against Uruguayan team Nacional , resulting in him being the tournament \\'s top goalscorer . Ronaldo scored 44 goals in 47 games with Cruzeiro , leading them to their first Copa do Brasil in 1993 , and the Minas Gerais State Championship in 1994 . Before joining Cruzeiro , he was turned down by Flamengo , the team he supported as a boy , after missing practice due to an inability to afford the fare for the hour-long bus ride , but Jairzinho saw Ronaldo \\'s potential and helped get him the move to Cruzeiro . PSV Eindhoven Ronaldo chose to join PSV after the 1994 World Cup . He was selected for the tournament despite being just 17 , but did not play in any games . His Brazil teammate Romário having played for PSV from 1988 to 1993 advised Ronaldo to move to the club . Ronaldo scored 10 minutes into his debut against Vitesse , and scored a brace on his home debut against Go Ahead Eagles . He scored 30 league goals in his first season in the Netherlands , which included seven braces and a hat-trick against Utrecht . After scoring a hat-trick in PSV \\'s game against Bayer Leverkusen in the 1994–95 UEFA Cup , Leverkusen striker and Germany World Cup winner Rudi Völler stated in a post match press conference , \" Never in my life have I seen an 18-year-old play in this way . \" His dribbles from midfield caught the attention of many in the sport , with future Barcelona teammate Luis Enrique stating , \" I \\'d seen him on television at PSV and thought ‘ wow \\' . Then he came to Barcelona . He \\'s the most spectacular player I \\'ve ever seen . He did things I \\'d never seen before . We \\'re now used to seeing Messi dribble past six players , but not then . Ronaldo was a beast . \" Nick Miller , match reporter for The Guardian , writes , \" What \\'s striking about Ronaldo in that first year at PSV is how complete he looks , even as a skinny teenager . Everything that would come to define him – the lightning pace , the blurry stepovers , the implausible impression that he was faster with the ball than without it , even the exceptional upper-body strength – was all there . \" Rob Smyth added , \" In many ways Ronaldo was the first PlayStation footballer . His stepover was a form of hypnosis , and his signature trick , the elastico , could certainly have come from a computer screen . \" Ronaldo \\'s second season was marred by a knee injury which kept him out of most of the campaign , but he still averaged nearly a goal a game , scoring 19 goals in 21 appearances , including a UEFA Cup four-goal haul against Finnish side MyPa . With PSV , Ronaldo won the Dutch Cup in 1996 and he was Eredivisie top scorer in 1995 . In his two seasons at the club he scored 54 goals in 58 games . Barcelona During his spell at PSV , Ronaldo attracted the attention of both Inter Milan and FC Barcelona . It was Barcelona that was willing to pay the then world record fee of $ 19.5 million . According to manager Bobby Robson , he signed an eight-year contract , and would play up front alone . Speaking to The New York Times regarding Ronaldo later that season , Robson said \" I do n\\'t think I \\'ve ever seen a player at 20 have so much \" . During the 1996–97 season , Ronaldo scored 47 goals in 49 games in all competitions , with his goal celebration invariably the same with his arms outstretched like the statue of Christ the Redeemer that watches over his native Rio de Janeiro . He led the Catalan side to UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup triumph where he capped the season with the winning goal in the cup final , and to Copa del Rey and Supercopa de España wins . He also won La Liga top scorer award in 1997 with 34 goals in 37 games , and the European Golden Shoe . Until the 2008–09 season , Ronaldo remained the last player to score more than 30 goals in La Liga . Ronaldo was at his physical peak at Barcelona , and many of his 47 goals involved him rounding the goalkeeper before slotting the ball into the net . Óscar García , Ronaldo \\'s teammate that season , stated , \" Back then , he was all fibre and muscle . He was a perfect physical specimen . Such incredible power matched to his technical skills could make him unstoppable . \" José Mourinho , who worked as an interpreter at Barcelona , referred to Ronaldo as \" the greatest player I have ever seen in my life \" , adding , \" I have no doubts . Ronaldo is the best my eyes have seen \" , and in 2014 regarded him as the best player post-Diego Maradona . Arguably Ronaldo \\'s most memorable Barcelona goal was scored at SD Compostela on 11 October 1996 ; having received the ball inside his own half , he evaded a cynical tackle of the first opponent with a drag back , before running away from another and ran towards goal , going past two more defenders in the box with close ball control , before finishing into the bottom corner of the net . The camera then cut to manager Robson who had got up off the bench and clasped his head in disbelief at what he had seen . The footage of the goal was later used in a Nike advert with a voiceover asking : \" Imagine you asked God to be the best player in the world , and he listened to you \" , and the goal was said to have been replayed 160 times on the main Spanish television channels in the 48 hours following the game . Half-way through the season , Barcelona Ronaldo agreed in principle to extend his contract to 2006 , doubling his salary in the process . A hat-trick against Valencia , the third goal of which saw him dissect two Valencia defenders before striking the ball into the net , saw Barcelona fans waving white handkerchiefs as an expression of admiration for an exceptional performance . Sid Lowe of Sports Illustrated states , \" That season Ronaldo was unstoppable . He was slim and powerful , skillful , fast and deadly . He was ridiculously good . \" At the end of 1996 , aged 20 , Ronaldo became the youngest player to win FIFA World Player of the Year . Inter Milan 1997–99 : World record transfer and Ballon d\\'Or win Ronaldo \\'s time at Barcelona lasted one season , as there were problems with the renegotiation of his contract . Barcelona thought there was an agreement in place , with Barcelona president Josep Lluís Núñez saying \" He \\'s ours for life \" , but when the parties reconvened the following day , the agreement collapsed , with Núñez admitting : \" It \\'s all over , Ronaldo is going \" . Speaking to ESPN , Ronaldo stated , \" I had reached an agreement to renew my contract just a month before that season finished , but a week later the lawyer and the president of Barcelona agreed that that contract was absurd . \" Paying the buy out clause fee in his contract , Inter Milan signed him in the summer of 1997 for a then world record fee of $ 27 million , making him the second player , after Diego Maradona , to break the world transfer record twice . He signed a five-year contract with the Italians , and was unveiled to 4000 Inter fans at their training ground . His debut came on 27 July during the pre-season fixture against Manchester United . His competitive debut came on the opening day of the 1997–98 season against Brescia . Ronaldo adapted to the Italian style of the game in his first season , finishing with 25 Serie A goals , and was named Serie A Footballer of the Year . Ronaldo started to develop into a complete forward . He began racking up assists , became first-choice penalty taker , taking and scoring freekicks . Halfway through his first season he won FIFA World Player of the Year for the second time , and collected the Ballon d\\'Or . During his time with Inter , he scored several goals against city rivals A.C . Milan in the Derby della Madonnina . Ronaldo and prolific Fiorentina striker Gabriel Batistuta were the two best strikers in Serie A , with their duels the most anticipated in Italy . Ronaldo \\'s goal celebrations often saw his Inter teammates congratulating him by kneeling down and pretending to shine his shoe . Ronaldo scored a trademark goal against Lazio in the 1998 UEFA Cup Final . Running through defence to go one on one with Lazio goalkeeper Luca Marchegiani , Ronaldo feinted to go right then left , without touching the ball , leaving Marchegiani on his backside , before going right and slotting the ball into the net . His Inter teammate Youri Djorkaeff stated ; \" Ronaldo was phenomenal . He proved that he was a cut above the rest that season . \" After the 1998 FIFA World Cup , where he was named player of the tournament , Ronaldo was widely regarded as the best striker in the world . By the end of the 1998–1999 season , he was appointed Inter Milan captain . 1999–2002 : Recurring injury problems After two seasons with Inter , A . C . Milan defender Paolo Maldini viewed Ronaldo and Diego Maradona as the two best players he ever faced , stating , \" Ronaldo during his first two years at Inter was a phenomenon . \" Inter had high hopes going into the 1999–2000 season with their attack including Ronaldo and Italian stars Roberto Baggio and Christian Vieri . However , on 21 November , during a Serie A match against Lecce , Ronaldo felt his knee buckle and was forced to limp off the field . A medical examination confirmed that the striker had ruptured a tendon in his knee and would require surgery . During his first comeback on 12 April 2000 , he played only six minutes during the first leg of the Coppa Italia final against Lazio before suffering a complete rupture of the knee-cap tendons . Ronaldo \\'s physiotherapist Nilton Petrone stated , \" his knee-cap actually exploded \" , and called it \" the worst football injury \" he \\'s ever seen . Ronaldo was forced to miss the entire 2000–01 season and much of the two seasons either side of it . Since his Inter teammate Javier Zanetti had replaced him as the team captain during his absence , he eventually inherited the captain \\'s armband in late 2001 . After two operations and rehabilitation , Ronaldo came back for the 2002 World Cup , helping Brazil win their fifth World Cup title . Later in 2002 , he won the FIFA World Player of the Year award for the third time , and transferred from Inter to Real Madrid . Ronaldo was given his most recognizable nickname , , by the Italian press while playing there . His Inter teammate Djorkaeff stated , \" when we were training , we would practically stop to watch him . It was extraordinary . \" Prior to his November 1999 injury Ronaldo had registered 42 goals in 58 Serie A games , in what was the hardest league to score in with the most advanced defensive strategies and the world \\'s best defenders . After five years he had played 99 games and scored 59 goals for Nerazzurri . Ronaldo \\'s performances at the club – especially the first two seasons before injury – saw him named among the four inaugural inductees into the Inter Milan Hall of Fame in 2018 . Real Madrid 2002–2005 : Ballon d\\'Or win and La Liga championship Having signed for Real Madrid for €46 million , his jersey sales broke all records on the first day . Ronaldo was part of the Galácticos era of global stars signed by the club every summer , which included Zinedine Zidane , Luís Figo , Roberto Carlos and David Beckham . He was sidelined through injury until October 2002 which added to the fans anticipation . Ronaldo scored twice on his debut against Alavés , the first 61 seconds after coming on . That same reception was observed at the final game of the season against Athletic Bilbao , where Ronaldo scored to finish his first season with 23 league goals and seal La Liga title for 2003 . He also won an Intercontinental Cup in 2002 and Spanish Super Cup in 2003 , scoring in both finals . In the second leg of Real Madrid \\'s Champions League quarter-final , Ronaldo scored a hat-trick against Manchester United at Old Trafford , knocking the English team out of the competition . Completing his hat-trick with a swerving strike from 30 yards , Ronaldo was substituted off after 67 minutes , and was given a standing ovation from both sets of fans . Reflecting on the ovation given to him from the oppositions \\' fans , Ronaldo stated that \" it remains a very beautiful , very special moment \" . Manchester United defender Wes Brown commmented , \" He was just unstoppable . A young Ronaldo [ before a series of injuries ] would have been even more dangerous , but it shows how good a player he was . Whenever he wanted to turn it on he could , on any stage , in any stadium \" . Ronaldo scored in a 2–1 home win over Juventus in the first leg of the Champions League semi-finals , but injury crucially kept him out of most of the second leg defeat where Real were eliminated . In the 2003–04 season , Madrid were on track to win the treble , until Ronaldo was injured towards the end of the season ; they subsequently lost the Copa del Rey final , were knocked out of the UEFA Champions League quarter-finals to AS Monaco , and suffered a league form breakdown . During that second season at the club , Ronaldo scored one of the fastest goals in the club \\'s history when he netted after 15 seconds in a league match against Atlético Madrid at the Bernabéu on 3 December 2003 . Three days later he helped to ensure Real \\'s first league victory over Barcelona at the Nou Camp in 20 years when he scored the second goal in a 2–1 victory over his former club . He finished the season as La Liga \\'s top scorer with 25 goals and received the Pichichi Trophy for a second time , despite Madrid losing the league title to Valencia . 2005–2007 : Final two seasons In his final two seasons at Real Madrid , Ronaldo missed a number of games with injuries and weight issues , and with the acquisition of Ruud van Nistelrooy in 2006 , he grew further out of favour with the manager Fabio Capello . Speaking in 2017 on Ronaldo \\'s weight issues and lack of fitness at Madrid , in addition to his ability , Capello summed up the conflicting emotions he has with the Brazilian , \" the most difficult player to handle was the best I coached : Ronaldo , il Fenomeno . \" In four and a half seasons at the club , Ronaldo scored over a century of goals , becoming the fifth foreigner at Madrid to achieve the feat after Argentine Alfredo Di Stéfano , Hungarian Ferenc Puskás , Mexican Hugo Sánchez and Chilean Iván Zamorano . Although the knee injuries before 2002 meant he \" was robbed of the explosiveness of his early years \" ( FourFourTwo magazine ) by the time he signed for Real Madrid , Ronaldo was named by Marca as a member of the \" Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid \\'s history \" . While past his 1990s prime , Ronaldo still drew praise from his Madrid colleagues , with Zidane stating , \" Without hesitation , Ronaldo is the best player I ever played with or against . He had such an ease with the ball . Every day I trained with him , I saw something different , something new , something beautiful . \" Michael Owen , who joined Madrid in 2004 , acknowledged that he never got the chance to play with Ronaldo in his prime when \" he had absolute blistering speed and strength , mesmerizing foot speed , he was just a blur , he \\'d be that fast \" , before adding , \" even in training , he showed more than enough to convince me that I would have loved to play with him at his peak . \" Teammates for six months , Van Nistelrooy said , \" Ronaldo was the best natural talent I ever played with . His innate ability went beyond anything that I \\'d ever seen or played alongside . \" AC Milan On 18 January 2007 , it was reported that Ronaldo agreed terms with AC Milan for a transfer of €8.05 million . Departing Real Madrid having been the club \\'s leading goalscorer for all of his four full seasons , Ronaldo thanked everyone except Capello , \" I would like to thank the fans who \\'ve supported me all the time and thank all the teammates that I \\'ve had here and all the coaches I \\'ve had – except one \" . Capello , who dropped him due to weight issues , commented , \" I wish him the best of luck in doing what he used to do which is being a great player . \" On 25 January , Ronaldo flew from Madrid to Milan , with statements on the club \\'s website stating Ronaldo was in Milan for a medical , and that a meeting had been arranged with Real Madrid officials to discuss and finalize his transfer to the Milanese club . On 26 January , Ronaldo successfully completed his medical tests at the Milanello training complex under the supervision of club doctors , and the transfer was completed on 30 January . Wearing the number 99 jersey , he made his debut as a substitute on 11 February 2007 in the 2–1 victory over Livorno . The next game at Siena , on 17 February , Ronaldo scored twice and assisted on a third goal in his first start for Milan , as they won 4–3 . In his first season , Ronaldo scored seven goals in 14 appearances . After his move to Milan , Ronaldo joined the list of the few players to have played for both Inter Milan and A.C . Milan in the Derby della Madonnina , and is one of few players to have scored for both rival teams in the Milan derby game ( for Inter in the 1998–99 season and for A.C . Milan in the 2006–07 season ) , the others being players such as Giuseppe Meazza , Zlatan Ibrahimović , Enrico Candiani and Aldo Cevenini . Ronaldo is also one of the few players to have started for Real Madrid and FC Barcelona , which also boasts a heated rivalry . Ronaldo , however , has never transferred directly between rival clubs . Ronaldo only played 300-plus minutes in his second season at Milan due to recurring injury problems and weight issues . Ronaldo \\'s only goals in the 2007–08 season , besides his goal against Lecce in pre-season , came in a 5–2 victory against Napoli at the San Siro , where he scored an emotional double . It was also the first time Milan \\'s much hyped attacking trio of Kaká , Alexandre Pato and Ronaldo , known as Ka-Pa-Ro , played together . Despite tremendous success over the past decade , Ronaldo never won the UEFA Champions League in his club career . In 2019 , FourFourTwo magazine named him the best player never to win the competition ; in 2020 , Sky Sports ranked him the second–best player ( after Diego Maradona ) never to win the Champions League or European Cup . Ronaldo stated , \" I live football with a passion that does n\\'t give me any peace for not winning the Champions League – it \\'s a trophy everyone would love to win . \" In 2011 , Paul Wilson wrote in The Guardian , \" Ronaldo was unlucky in his timing or his choice of club – for there is no doubt that at his very best he would have walked into any club in the world . \" During the 2006–07 season , though Milan won the 2006–07 title , Ronaldo was cup-tied with Madrid and ineligible to take part . The closest that he came to Champions League success was in 2003 when he helped Real Madrid to the semi-finals , in which they lost to Juventus . On 13 February 2008 , Ronaldo suffered a severe season-ending knee injury while jumping for a cross in Milan 1–1 draw with Livorno , and was stretchered off and taken to a hospital . The club confirmed after the match that Ronaldo had ruptured the kneecap ligament in his left knee . It marked the third such occurrence of this injury , which he suffered twice to his right knee in 1999 and 2000 . Teammate Clarence Seedorf stated , \" My heart stopped beating because it was like watching a repeat of the injury he suffered playing for Inter Milan against Lazio [ in 2000 ] . His reaction was the same . \" Silvio Berlusconi told Italy \\'s RAI TV , \" He fears for his career . I called him last evening and told him to believe in himself . He has enormous physical potential . \" Ronaldo was released by Milan at the end of the season , as his contract expired and was not renewed . Corinthians 2009–2010 : Paulistão and Copa do Brasil Ronaldo trained with Rio de Janeiro based Brazilian club Flamengo during his recovery from knee surgery , and the club \\'s board of directors said that the doors were open for him to join . On 9 December , however , Ronaldo signed a one-year deal with Flamengo \\'s league rival Corinthians . The announcement received much publicity in the Brazilian press about his choice of Corinthians over Flamengo , since Ronaldo publicly declared himself a Flamengo fan . Rio-based sports newspaper Lance ! called Ronaldo a \" phenomenal traitor \" , and some angry fans burned Ronaldo shirts outside the Flamengo headquarters . Ronaldo responded that playing for Corinthians was the only option open to him . \" I understand perfectly , I \\'m openly a Flamengo fan . But I was training with Flamengo for four months and did n\\'t receive any offer . Corinthians made an offer that will let me continue my career . \" Ronaldo played his first match for Corinthians on 4 March 2009 , a Copa do Brasil match against Itumbiara at Estádio Juscelino Kubitschek , in which he came as a substitute for Jorge Henrique . Ronaldo scored his first goal for Corinthians on 8 March 2009 in a Campeonato Paulista match against Palmeiras . Scoring eight goals in nine matches , his form led to calls for his return to the Brazil national team – nearly 70 % of respondents in a poll for the O Globo newspaper voted that he should be reinstated , with the country \\'s president Lula also calling for his immediate return . He scored twice in a 3–1 win against local rivals Santos in the first leg of the state championship final , with Santos idol Pelé looking on from the stands . His second goal , a chip over the Santos goalkeeper from 30 yards out , sent the Corinthians fans into hysteria . Ultimately , he helped Corinthians win the Campeonato Paulista with 10 goals in 14 games . Ronaldo scored in Corinthians 4–2 aggregate defeat of Internacional in the final of the 2009 Copa do Brasil , helping the club win the trophy for the third time ( the second of his career ) , thus earning a spot in the Copa Libertadores 2010 . Following an injury lay off he returned on 20 September in a match against Goiás , and a week later scored for Corinthians in a draw against São Paulo FC . He finished the Brazilian Serie A 2009 with 12 goals in 20 matches . 2011 : Retirement In February 2010 , Ronaldo signed a contract extension with Corinthians that would keep him with the club until the end of 2011 , and said he would then retire . Commenting on his weight issues following this announcement , Brian Homewood of The Guardian states , \" Sadly , Ronaldo \\'s celebrity is now more of a draw than his skills on the pitch – Coldplay , Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres and actor Hugh Jackman have all visited São Paulo to get a picture with the roly‑poly star . \" In February 2011 , after Corinthians were eliminated from the 2011 Copa Libertadores by the Colombian team Deportes Tolima , Ronaldo announced his retirement from football , concluding an 18-year career . In an emotional press conference on 14 February , he cited pain and hypothyroidism as the reasons for his premature retirement . He discovered he had hypothyroidism – a condition which slows down metabolism and causes weight gain – during tests with Milan in 2007 . Ronaldo admitted his body had finally succumbed to the crippling litany of injuries that had blighted his career : \" It \\'s very hard to leave something that made me so happy . Mentally I wanted to continue but I have to acknowledge that I lost to my body . The head wants to go on but the body ca n\\'t take any more . I think of an action but I ca n\\'t do it the way I want to . It \\'s time to go . \" International career Ronaldo made his international debut for Brazil on 23 March 1994 , in a friendly match in Recife against Argentina ; his first senior goal for Brazil came on 4 May 1994 , in a 3–0 friendly win over Iceland . He went to the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States as a 17-year-old , but did not play , as Brazil went on to win the tournament . He stated he was \" overjoyed \" at the experience . He was then known as Ronaldinho ( \" little Ronaldo \" in Portuguese ) , because Ronaldo Rodrigues de Jesus , his older teammate on the tournament , was also called Ronaldo and nicknamed Ronaldão ( \" big Ronaldo \" ) to further distinguish them . Another Brazilian player , Ronaldo de Assis Moreira , now widely known as Ronaldinho , was called Ronaldinho Gaúcho when he joined the Brazilian main national team in 1999 . In the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta , Ronaldo played with the name Ronaldinho on his shirt , since centre back Ronaldo Guiaro , two years his senior , was one of his teammates . Brazil went on to win the bronze medal . Ronaldo also represented Brazil in the 1995 Copa América ( finishing in second place ) , and won both the 1997 and the 1999 editions of the tournament . He was named player of the tournament in 1997 , was the top scorer in 1999 , and he scored in the finals of both – against Bolivia in 1997 and Uruguay in 1999 . He also took part in the friendly Tournoi de France in 1997 , preceding the 1998 FIFA World Cup , scoring a goal as Brazil finished in second . Ronaldo starred alongside Romário , dubbed the Ro-Ro attack , in the 1997 FIFA Confederations Cup , helping Brazil win their first ever Confederations Cup title where he finished as the third highest scorer with 4 goals , scoring a hat-trick over Australia in the final . On the combination of Ronaldo and Romário , Will Sharp writes , \" to the elation of all those fortunate enough to have watched them , they found themselves together , fated with the opportunity to forge one of the most outrageous offensive pairings the game has ever seen . Their partnership was brief but it was inexplicably brilliant . \" 1998 FIFA World Cup Ronaldo entered the 1998 FIFA World Cup billed as the world \\'s greatest player by reporters in the sport . Jacob Steinberg of The Guardian writes , \" In 1998 , no one was as ferociously talented as Ronaldo , whose supernatural mixture of power , pace and skill had made him the player every child in the playground wanted to be ; at the age of 21 , the hopes and dreams of a nation rested on his shoulders . \" Ronaldo scored four goals and made three assists en route to the final , scoring once and assisting Bebeto \\'s goal in a 3–0 win against Morocco in the team \\'s second group stage match , netting twice in a 4–1 win against Chile in the round of 16 , set–up two goals in Brazil \\'s 3–2 victory over Denmark in the quarter-finals , and scored once in the 1–1 draw against the Netherlands in the semi-finals , also netting Brazil \\'s first penalty in the 4–2 shoot–out victory . Hours before the final against France , Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit . At first , he was removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match , and the team sheet ( with Edmundo as his replacement ) was submitted to the FIFA delegate . The starting line up without Ronaldo was released to a stunned world media . The BBC \\'s John Motson stated , \" The scenes in the commentary box have been absolute mayhem and chaos . \" However , shortly before kick off , after pleading that he felt fine and requested to play , Ronaldo was reinstated by Brazil coach Mário Zagallo . Ronaldo was the last Brazilian player out of the tunnel as the teams entered the field . During the playing of the Brazil national anthem the camera focused on him throughout , with Ronaldo showing little emotion . Steinberg states that Ronaldo \" sleepwalked \" through the final , which also saw him injured in a collision with French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez . Zagallo admitted the fears over Ronaldo affected his team psychologically , and stated \" for the whole of the first half I was wondering whether to take him off \" , but feared a public outcry in Brazil had he done so . Brazil lost the match to hosts France 3–0 . Ronaldo later reflected : \" We lost the World Cup but I won another cup – my life . \" An inquest was launched in Brazil , with team doctor Lídio Toledo telling the commission \" imagine if I stopped Ronaldo playing and Brazil lost . At that moment I \\'d have to go and live on the North Pole . \" Adrian Williams , professor of clinical neurology at Birmingham University , said that Ronaldo should not have played , that he would have been feeling the after effects of the seizure , and \" there is no way that he would have been able to perform to the best of his ability within 24 hours of his first fit – if it was his first fit . \" Despite his sub-par performance in the final due to his seizure hours earlier , Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament for his performances leading up to the final , and finished the tournament as the joint-third highest scorer . The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations which persisted for years , with Alex Bellos writing in The Guardian , A conspiracy surrounded Nike , the sportswear company who sponsored Ronaldo and the Brazilian national team , with some in Brazil believing the company had forced Ronaldo to play . The parliamentary inquiry was unable to find any wider conspiracy , although the Brazilian public remained unconvinced . Reporting for CNN , Don Riddell wrote , \" It \\'s one of the great mysteries of our time : not the Loch Ness Monster , Stonehenge or the Lost City of Atlantis ; it \\'s the case of the missing striker – not so much a whodunit , more a kind of a what the heck happened ? \" 2002 FIFA World Cup Prior to the 2002 FIFA World Cup , Ronaldo had barely played since rupturing the cruciate ligament in his right knee in April 2000 , and he missed Brazil \\'s entire qualification campaign where , in his absence , the team had been poor . Tim Vickery writes , \" Without Ronaldo , Brazil were a shambles , fortunate even to get to the tournament . With him , it was a different story . \" In a remarkable comeback from injury that had threatened his career , Ronaldo led Brazil to their record fifth World Cup title , receiving the Golden Boot as top scorer with eight goals . Many publications regarded his personal triumph as \" redemption \" for what occurred at the previous World Cup . Ronaldo spoke about his obsession with lifting the World Cup trophy , having missed out in 1998 . \" I used to visualise the trophy in front of my eyes and imagine what a wonderful feeling it must be to hold it up in the air . It was a fabulous feeling actually to hold it in my hands and kiss it . \" Dubbed the \" three R \\'s \" , Ronaldo starred in a formidable attack alongside Rivaldo and Ronaldinho , and the trio were named in the FIFA World Cup All-Star Team . Ronaldo scored against every opponent in the tournament except in the quarter-finals against England . The match-winner against Turkey in the semi-final , with the winning goal a toe-poke finish with little back-lift while on the run – a finish he learned while playing futsal in his youth – the final whistle saw fans behind the goal hoist huge white letters to spell out his name akin to the Hollywood sign . Much attention was on his haircut – only part of his head was shaved – done as a deliberate distraction to shift media attention away from a leg injury . He revealed , \" when I arrived in training with this haircut everybody stopped talking about the injury \" . In the final against Germany in Yokohama , Japan , Ronaldo scored twice in Brazil \\'s 2–0 win and tied Pelé \\'s Brazilian record of 12 career World Cup goals . Ronaldo was the first player to seek out German players to offer his condolences , before he was congratulated by Pelé when receiving his World Cup winners medal . Gérard Saillant , the French surgeon who operated on Ronaldo \\'s knee , was in the crowd as his guest , and stated after the game ; \" This gives hope to everyone who is injured , even those who are n\\'t sportsmen , to see that by fighting you can make it . He \\'s back to where he was ; it \\'s hugely satisfying and I am very moved . \" Ronaldo received a number of accolades for his achievement , including the Laureus World Sports Award for Comeback of the Year and the BBC World Sport Star of the Year , and in December 2002 he dedicated his third FIFA World Player of the Year award to the medical team which helped him recover . In a 2017 interview with Fox Sports , Ronaldo stated , \" the best team I played in was the Brazilian one in 2002 , we felt that we could always score . It was a team without any vanity , or individuals . The collective was important . \" 2006 FIFA World Cup On 2 June 2004 , Ronaldo scored an unusual hat-trick of penalties for Brazil against arch-rivals Argentina in a 2006 World Cup qualifying match , which put them top of the group . With 10 goals in 15 games , including a goal against Venezuela in the last game to secure first place , Ronaldo was the South American top scorer in Brazil \\'s qualifying campaign . Prior to the tournament , questions were asked of his weight and fitness , but was declared fit for Brazil \\'s opening match with Croatia . At the 2006 World Cup , Ronaldo was part of a much-publicized \" magic quartet \" alongside Adriano , Ronaldinho and Kaká . The all-star Brazilian team was promoted as masters of Joga Bonito , \" the beautiful game \" , which was advertised by Nike before the tournament . Although Brazil won their first two group games against Croatia and Australia , Ronaldo was repeatedly jeered for being overweight and slow , but coach Carlos Alberto Parreira kept him in the starting lineup . With two goals against Japan in the third match , Ronaldo became the 20th player to score in three World Cups and also equalled the all-time World Cup finals scoring record of fourteen , held by Gerd Müller ( Ronaldo scored at France 98 , Korea/Japan 2002 and Germany 2006 ) . He then broke Müller \\'s record in the Round of 16 match against Ghana by scoring his fifteenth-career World Cup goal . With his third goal of the tournament , Ronaldo became only the second player ever , after Jürgen Klinsmann , to score at least three goals in each of three World Cups . Brazil , however , were knocked out by France 1–0 with a goal by striker Thierry Henry in the quarter-finals . Ronaldo was awarded the Bronze Shoe as the third-highest goal-scorer of the World Cup . Having been listed in Guinness World Records , Ronaldo stated , \" I am proud of my career and of the records I set . But I know that one day they will be broken . \" Ronaldo and Klinsmann \\'s shared record of at least three goals in three separate World Cup finals was broken by German striker Miroslav Klose , who has a record of at least four goals in each of three tournaments , having netted five at both the 2002 and 2006 finals , and four at the 2010 tournament . Ronaldo finished with fifteen goals in nineteen World Cup matches , for an average of 0.79 per game . His teammate Kaká reflected , \" Ronaldo is the best player I have ever played with . I have seen il Fenomeno do things nobody else has ever done . \" Farewell match and sporadic appearances In February 2011 it was announced that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil , a friendly against Romania in São Paulo on 7 June 2011 , five years after his last match with the national team . Despite it being almost unheard of in international football for players to be given a farewell match for their national side , Brazilian Football Confederation officials stated that given the stellar career of Ronaldo , it was only fitting that his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation . Ronaldo played for 15 minutes in a match that ended with a Brazilian victory with a goal from Fred . Fred celebrated his goal with Ronaldo \\'s famous \\'finger wag \\' celebration along with his Brazilian teammates . Ronaldo was introduced after 30 minutes , partnering 19-year-old Neymar in attack , and had three shots on target which were saved by the Romanian goalkeeper . After the first half ended , Ronaldo made a farewell speech to the crowd . With 62 goals for Brazil Ronaldo retired from international football as the second-highest goalscorer for his country , behind only Pelé ( Neymar has since moved into second place , with Ronaldo the third-highest scorer as of October 2020 ) . On 13 December 2011 Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane played a charity match with their friends against former and current players of the German team Hamburg in the ninth edition of the Match Against Poverty series , which Ronaldo and Zidane established in 2003 . In December 2012 , Ronaldo and Zidane reunited for the Match Against Poverty in Porto Alegre , Portugal , with the field littered with World Cup winners from France and Brazil , which also saw 1982 World Cup star Zico ( Ronaldo \\'s childhood idol ) turn out for Ronaldo \\'s team . In January 2013 , Ronaldo was named one of the six ambassadors of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil . Ronaldo was chosen as a goodwill ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme ( UNDP ) in 2000 as he had the highest global appeal among sportspeople , and he accepted the role as he saw it as \" an obligation \" to help with causes around the world . Ronaldo played in the UNDP \\'s 11th Match Against Poverty on 4 March 2014 against a Zidane XI in Bern , Switzerland , with proceeds raised helping the recovery efforts in the Philippines in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan . Joined by Didier Drogba in attack , Ronaldo scored a hat-trick in the next year \\'s match on 21 April 2015 in St Etienne , France , with proceeds going towards the African countries most affected by the Ebola epidemic . On 14 June 2018 , Ronaldo featured at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow , Russia . He walked out with a child wearing a Russia 2018 shirt at the beginning , and returned at the end of the ceremony with the official ball of the 2018 World Cup – Adidas Telstar 18 – which was sent into space with the International Space Station crew in March and came back to Earth in early June . Style of play and legacy Ronaldo is regarded as one of the greatest and most complete forwards of all time . Dubbed Il ( or O ) Fenomeno ( the phenomenon ) , he was a prolific goalscorer , and despite being more of an individualistic attacker , he was also capable of providing assists for his teammates , due to his vision , passing and crossing ability . He was an extremely powerful , fast , and technical player , with excellent movement , as well as being a composed finisher . Highly regarded for his technical ability , Ronaldo was able to use both feet , despite being naturally right footed , and is considered one of the most skilful dribblers in the game . Along with Brazilian compatriot Romário and Liberian star George Weah , Ronaldo was seen as a new breed of striker in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal . Often positioned near midfield , once in possession of the ball he would waste no time in making a beeline towards goal , with Rob Smyth writing , \" he played like every attack had a 10-second deadline .. he would explode into life with no warning for defenders . \" He frequently beat several players when dribbling at speed , and excelled in one on one situations , due to his ball control , acceleration , agility , balance and nimble footwork in his prime . His coach at Barcelona , Bobby Robson , commented : \" Ronaldo could start from the halfway line and the whole stadium would ignite . He was the fastest thing I \\'ve ever seen running with the ball . Had he managed to stay free of injury , he had every chance of becoming the best footballer ever . \" In one on one situations , Ronaldo often used elaborate feints to trick and beat defenders and goalkeepers ; he popularised the use of many football tricks and skills , such as the elastico and the step over . Sid Lowe of Sports Illustrated writes , \" When he was one on one with the goalkeeper , you knew that he would score . He was so natural , so cool , so utterly in control . He would dip the shoulder , step over , and bang ! . \" His Barcelona teammate Óscar García observed , \" I \\'d never seen anyone play football with such technical ability , creativity and precision at that incredible speed . What stood out to all of us , from the moment we met Ronnie , was that he could do things which other players found very difficult and make them look easy . But he could also produce those things while running at an unbelievable , explosive pace . \" With his combination of speed , skill and finishing Ronaldinho called Ronaldo \" the most complete striker there has ever been \" , a view echoed by Zlatan Ibrahimović , who stated , \" as a football player , he was complete . There will never , in my view , be a better player than him . \" The goalscoring idol of Lionel Messi , the Argentine states \" Ronaldo was the best striker I \\'ve ever seen . He was so fast he could score from nothing . \" Wanting to emulate Ronaldo growing up , Egypt and Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah opined , \" The ability , the speed , the intelligence , he had everything \" . Naming Ronaldo as an inspiration , Wayne Rooney stated , \" as an out-and-out forward he was probably the best . \" The outstanding influence for a generation of strikers , from Karim Benzema to Sergio Agüero , with Romelu Lukaku stating \" he changed the dimension of a striker \" and could \" dribble like a winger , run like a sprinter \" , Zlatan added , \" nobody influenced football and the players who emerged as much as Ronaldo \" . Emilio Butragueño stated , \" Ronaldo creates a goalscoring opportunity where it does n\\'t exist . Most strikers need the midfielders and their teammates , but he does not . \" On his speed of thought , Kaká said \" For me the best players are those who are able to think of a play and execute it quickest and in the best way possible , and Ronaldo was the best at that . The speed of thought he had – and the speed he had to carry out his actions – were perfect . \" Ronaldo was also a strong and powerful player who could shield the ball from the opposition , with former Italian defender Alessandro Nesta ( who faced Ronaldo in a high-profile one on one duel in the 1998 UEFA Cup final which was billed as \" the best attacker against the best defender in Serie A \" ) stating : \" It was the worst experience of my career . Ronaldo is the hardest attacker I \\'ve ever had to face . \" Asked who was the toughest opponent of his career , Fabio Cannavaro responded , \" I have no doubt , Ronaldo , the phenomenon . For my generation he was what Maradona or Pelé were for the previous ones . He was unmarkable . \" Sid Lowe compared Ronaldo \\'s ability to take on a number of opponents on a single run to what rugby player Jonah Lomu was doing in the same era . With his quick reactions and anticipation , Ronaldo often beat defenders to the ball , and as a finisher he was effective with his head as well as either foot , and could finish well both inside and outside the penalty area . Comparing his natural ability to Roger Federer , Paul MacDonald of Goal writes , \" there \\'s a joy to be had watching something we know to be extremely difficult executed with considerable ease . Ronaldo in his prime was able to do that better than anyone who has ever played the game . \" A reliance on his superior innate ability is given as a reason for his application in training often not being as high as his teammates – though his knee issues may also have been a factor – with his Brazil teammate Emerson stating \" Ronaldo felt he did n\\'t need to work as hard as us , that he could do in two days what the rest of us would take ten days to do . And usually , he was right \" . On his precocious talent – a talent which saw him become the youngest FIFA World Player of the Year at age 20 , and youngest Ballon d\\'Or recipient aged 21 – Rob Smyth of The Guardian wrote in 2016 , \" Ronaldo is easily the best of the past 30 years , possibly ever . The other Ronaldo and Messi were brilliant teenagers but had nothing like the same impact at that age . Only Pelé , Diego Maradona and George Best can really compare . \" Asked to name the best player of his lifetime , José Mourinho said , \" Ronaldo , El Fenomeno . Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers . They have remained at the top every day for 15 years . However , if we are talking strictly about talent and skill , nobody surpasses Ronaldo . \" Mikaël Silvestre states , \" I played against [ Lionel ] Messi and I played with Cristiano at Manchester United , but he [ Ronaldo ] is something else in terms of speed . Cristiano , maybe you can guess that he has three or four tricks he would use most of the time , but Ronaldo , it was always something different . He was inventing things on the spot , so you can ’ t guide him left or right because he ’ s going to get out of these situations , no matter what \" . In 2020 , Ronaldo was named in the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team , a greatest all-time XI published by France Football magazine . At his physical peak in the 1990s , Ronaldo became severely affected by the knee injuries he suffered from late 1999 onward and the subsequent weight gain during his inactivity , which limited his speed , fitness , and mobility . According to his physiotherapist Nilton Petrone , Ronaldo was vulnerable to injury due to a medical condition combined with his explosive running . \" Ronaldo had a problem called trochlear dysplasia . This makes the relationship between the kneecap and the femur a bit unstable . There is no direct surgery for that so the kneecap keeps , for a lack of a better word , \" dancing \" on the femur . Ronaldo \\'s injuries were n\\'t because his body was weak , but because of his explosive capacity . He did n\\'t just run fast in a straight line , he also changed direction at incredible speed . Ronaldo moved from left to right very fast ... so it was obvious , by the way that he played , that injuries were always a possibility \" . Acknowledging \" he was never quite the same \" after his knee injury in 2000 , with \" his pace and sheer brute force diminished in comparison to The Phenomenon \" in the 1990s , FourFourTwo magazine ranked him the best player at the 2002 World Cup , adding \" he was still a cut above the rest \" in the tournament . Majority owner of Real Valladolid In September 2018 , Ronaldo became the majority owner of La Liga club Real Valladolid after buying a 51 % controlling stake in the club for €30 million . At his unveiling as the club \\'s new owner at Valladolid city hall , Ronaldo stated , \" I have gone through many stages in my training in football to prepare for this . Football is all about passion . We want to build the best team possible to compete while also giving information about our management with transparency . \" Ownership of Cruzeiro In December 2021 , Ronaldo bought a controlling stake in his boyhood club Cruzeiro . Investing 400 million reais ( $ 70 million ) in the club , Ronaldo stated he wants to \" give back to Cruzeiro and take them where they deserve to be . \" Outside football Personal life During 1997 , Ronaldo met the Brazilian model and actress Susana Werner on the set of Brazilian telenovela Malhação when they acted together in three episodes . Although they never married , they began a long-term relationship and lived together in Milan until the beginning of 1999 . In December 1999 , Ronaldo married Brazilian footballer Milene Domingues , at the time pregnant with the couple \\'s first son , Ronald , who was born in Milan , on 6 April 2000 . The marriage lasted four years . In 2005 , Ronaldo became engaged to Brazilian model and MTV VJ Daniela Cicarelli , who became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage ; the relationship lasted only three months after their luxurious wedding at the Château de Chantilly . The ceremony reportedly cost £700,000 ( €896,000 ) . Despite his fame – a 2003 poll by Nike listed him the world \\'s most famous sportsperson ( and third most famous person overall ) – Ronaldo is protective of his privacy , including with teammates , stating in an interview with The Telegraph , \" each [ player ] has his own private life , and no one thinks about anyone else \\'s private life . Or talks about it . \" By 2003 he was fluent in Portuguese , Spanish and Italian , and had a good understanding of English . In a 2005 interview with Folha de S.Paulo , Ronaldo revealed that , somewhat unexpectedly , he identified racially as white , generating a wider conversation about the complex role of race in Brazil . Ronaldo \\'s father , Nelio Nazario , stated , \" He knows full well that he \\'s black . Actually , at the time , I thought it was some philosophy , something to that effect . Because he knows he \\'s black . \" According to a study led by geneticist Sérgio Pena of the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics , most Brazilians often have a misconception about their roots . \" The maternal ancestry of the Brazilian white was one-third African , one third Amerindian , and one third European . An individual who considers himself white may be genomically more African than an individual who considers himself to be brown or black . \" In April 2008 , Ronaldo was involved in a scandal involving three travesti prostitutes whom he met in a nightclub in Rio de Janeiro . Ronaldo claimed that upon discovering that they were legally male , he offered them $ 600 to leave . One of the three attempted to blackmail Ronaldo , while the other two admitted the allegations were false . Ronaldo \\'s engagement to Maria Beatriz Antony was immediately halted , but resumed shortly after . Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their first daughter , named Maria Sophia , in Rio de Janeiro , on 24 December 2008 . In April 2009 , the family moved to a new penthouse in São Paulo . On 6 April 2010 , Maria Beatriz Antony gave birth to their second daughter . The girl , born in São Paulo , was named Maria Alice . Coincidentally , Maria Alice was born exactly 10 years after her older brother Ronald . In December 2010 , Ronaldo and his family moved to a new mansion in São Paulo . Also in December , Ronaldo took a paternity test and was confirmed to be the father of a boy named Alexander , born in April 2005 . The boy was born after a brief relationship between Ronaldo and Michele Umezu , a Brazilian waitress who Ronaldo first met in Tokyo in 2002 . After the confirmation of his fourth child , Ronaldo stated on 6 December 2010 that he had had a vasectomy , feeling that having four children was enough . In a 2011 interview with the BBC , former Real Madrid teammate Steve McManaman spoke about Ronaldo \\'s personality . \" He could go in a restaurant , and I could go in with him , and you \\'re not just there with close friends . He invites everybody . You \\'d be at a table with him and it \\'d be a judge sitting opposite talking to a politician with someone off the street listening in . So he just had this amazing aura , where everyone wanted to join him . Sometimes there \\'d be 20 to 30 people sitting at meal times with him . He was a wonderful person . Everybody would second that , no matter what club he played for . \" Ronaldo was the co-owner of A1 Team Brazil , along with former F1 driver Emerson Fittipaldi . Ronaldo co-owns the sports marketing company 9INE , with his friend , mixed martial artist Anderson Silva , one of his clients . A keen poker player , in April 2013 Ronaldo became a member of PokerStars SportStar , and in 2014 he played a charity poker tournament against tennis star Rafael Nadal . On 11 December 2014 , Ronaldo became a minority owner of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League . In 2015 , Ronaldo opened eight new branches of his youth football school – the Ronaldo Academy – in China , the U.S . and Brazil , with 100 expected to be opened worldwide by 2020 . In 2017 , Ronaldo \\'s son , Ronald , was selected for the junior football team representing Brazil in the 2017 Maccabiah Games . The Maccabiah is described as \" the Jewish Olympics \" ; Ronald is not Jewish , but some participating countries have more relaxed rules about eligibility and Ronald is a member of a Jewish football club . Media Ronaldo appeared in The Simpsons season 18 episode \" Marge Gamer \" broadcast in April 2007 . Simon Crerar of The Times listed Ronaldo \\'s performance as one of the thirty-three funniest cameos in the history of the show . Ronaldo made a cameo appearance in each film of the Goal ! film trilogy , Goal ! ( 2005 ) , Goal II : Living the Dream ( 2007 ) and Goal III : Taking on the World ( 2009 ) . Archive footage of Ronaldo features in the music video \" We Are One ( Ole Ola ) \" , the official song of the 2014 World Cup by Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez . Ronaldo has appeared in various commercials , from Snickers chocolate bar to Pirelli tyres . Ronaldo \\'s usual goal celebration of both arms outstretched – especially from his early career – was the basis for Pirelli \\'s 1998 commercial where he replaced the figure of Christ from the Christ the Redeemer statue that towers over his home city of Rio de Janeiro while in an Inter Milan strip . It was controversial with the Catholic Church . Released in 2000 for the PlayStation and Game Boy Color , the video game Ronaldo V-Football was exclusively endorsed by Ronaldo . In 2017 Ronaldo was added as an icon to the Ultimate Team in EA Sports \\' FIFA video game FIFA 18 , receiving a 95 rating along with Brazilian compatriot Pelé , Argentine playmaker Diego Maradona , former Russian goalkeeper Lev Yashin and former French star Thierry Henry . Ronaldo also appears as the cover athlete on the Icon edition of the game . In May 2021 , DAZN released the first of a six-part series titled Ronaldo : El Presidente . The series takes viewers inside the day-to-day running of Real Valladolid , revealing every challenge and triumph in Valladolid \\'s first full season under their Brazilian president , intercut with parallel narratives detailing the highs and lows of Ronaldo \\'s own playing career . Nike sponsorship Ronaldo has been sponsored by sportswear company Nike since the early part of his career . In 1996 , Nike signed Ronaldo to a 10-year contract and to a lifetime endorsement deal worth over $ 180 million . He is closely associated with the original Nike Mercurial R9 that was designed for him for the 1998 FIFA World Cup . To celebrate 15 years of the boot , Nike created a Mercurial Vapor IX inspired by the 1998 design , with Phil McCartney , VP of Football Footwear for Nike , stating ; \" Ronaldo \\'s impact on the game 15 years ago was immense , and in the run up to 2014 , we wanted to celebrate that boot and the man himself . We thought a modern construction of his 1998 boot would be a great commemoration of that moment . \" In 2018 , Ronaldo \\'s R9 Mercurial boots inspired the Nike Mercurial Superfly VI boots commissioned for Kylian Mbappé . Unveiled in 2000 , a bronze statue of Ronaldo is located next to Ronaldo Field at Nike headquarters in Beaverton , Oregon . Ronaldo has appeared in a series of Nike commercials . He starred in the 1996 Nike commercial titled \" Good vs Evil \" in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre . Appearing alongside football players from around the world , including Paolo Maldini , Eric Cantona , Luís Figo , Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos , they defend \" the beautiful game \" against a team of demonic warriors , destroying evil by winning the match .

Administered by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional , it is contested by 20 teams , with the three lowest-placed teams at the end of each season being relegated to the Segunda División and replaced by the top two teams and a play-off winner in that division . Since its inception , a total of 62 teams have competed in La Liga . Nine teams have been crowned champions , with Real Madrid winning the title a record 34 times . During the 1940s Valencia , Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs , winning several titles . Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s , each winning four La Liga titles during the decade . During the 1960s and 1970s , Real Madrid dominated La Liga , winning 14 titles , with Atlético Madrid winning four . During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga , but the Basque clubs of Athletic Club and Real Sociedad had their share of success , each winning two Liga titles . From the 1990s onward , Barcelona have dominated La Liga , winning 16 titles to date . Although Real Madrid has been prominent , winning nine titles , La Liga has also seen other champions , including Atlético Madrid , Valencia , and Deportivo La Coruña . According to UEFA \\'s league coefficient rankings , La Liga has been the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 ( calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons ) and has led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019 , more than any other country . It has also produced the continent \\'s top-rated club more times ( 22 ) than any other league in that period , more than double that of second-placed Serie A ( Italy ) , including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019 ; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid . La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League ( 18 ) , UEFA Europa League ( 13 ) , UEFA Super Cup ( 15 ) , and FIFA Club World Cup ( 7 ) titles , and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d\\'Or awards ( 23 ) , The Best FIFA Men \\'s Player awards including FIFA World Player of the Year ( 19 ) , and UEFA Men \\'s Player of the Year awards including UEFA Club Footballer of the Year ( 11 ) . La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally , with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018–19 season . This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world , behind the Bundesliga and the Premier League , and above the other two so-called \" Big Five \" European leagues , Serie A and Ligue 1 . La Liga is also the sixth wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue , after the NFL , MLB , the NBA , the Premier League , and the NHL . Competition format The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format . During the course of a season , which lasts from August to May , each club plays every other club twice , once at home and once away , for 38 matches . Teams receive three points for a win , one point for a draw , and no points for a loss . Teams are ranked by total points , with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season . Promotion and relegation A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Primera División and the Segunda División . The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the Segunda División , and the top two teams from the Segunda División promoted to La Liga , with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third , fourth , fifth and sixth placed clubs . Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league \\'s history ; Tie breaker rules If points are equal between two or more clubs , the rules are : If all clubs involved have played each other twice : If the tie is between two clubs , then the tie is broken using the head-to-head goal difference for those clubs ( without away goals rule ) . If the tie is between more than two clubs , then the tie is broken using the games the clubs have played against each other : a ) head-to-head points b ) head-to-head goal difference If two legged games between all clubs involved have not been played , or the tie is not broken by the rules above , it is broken using : a ) total goal difference b ) total goals scored If the tie is still not broken , the winner will be determined by Fair Play scales . These are : yellow card , 1 point doubled yellow card/ejection , 2 points direct red card , 3 points suspension or disqualification of coach , executive or other club personnel ( outside referees \\' decisions ) , 5 points misconduct of the supporters : mild 5 points , serious 6 points , very serious 7 points stadium closure , 10 points if the Competition Committee removes a penalty , the points are also removed If the tie is still not broken , it will be resolved with a tie-break match in a neutral stadium . Qualification for European competitions Current criteria The top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season \\'s UEFA Champions League group stage . The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season \\'s UEFA Champions League group stage . If this means 6 La Liga teams qualify , then the 4th place team in La Liga instead plays in the UEFA Europa League , as any single nation is limited to a maximum of 5 teams . The 5th place team in La Liga qualifies for the subsequent season \\'s UEFA Europa League group stage . The winner of the Copa del Rey also qualifies for the subsequent season \\'s UEFA Europa League group stage , but if the winner also finished in the top 5 places in La Liga , then this place reverts to the team that finished 6th in La Liga . Furthermore , the 6th place ( or 7th if 6th already qualifies ) team qualifies for the subsequent season \\'s UEFA Europa League second qualifying round . The number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients , which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years . As of the end of season 2020–21 , the ranking of Spain ( and de facto La Liga ) is second . History Foundation In April 1928 , José María Acha , a director at Getxo , first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain . After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part , the Real Federación Española de Fútbol eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first Primera División in 1929 . Barcelona , Real Madrid , Athletic Club , Real Sociedad , Getxo , and Real Unión were all selected as previous winners of the Copa del Rey . Atlético Madrid , Espanyol , and Europa qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knockout competition . Only three of the founding clubs ( Real Madrid , Barcelona , and Athletic Club ) have never been relegated from the Primera División . 1930s : Athletic Club prominence Although Barcelona won the very first Liga in 1929 and Real Madrid won their first titles in 1932 and 1933 , it was Athletic Club that set the early pace winning Primera División in 1930 , 1931 , 1934 and 1936 . They were also runners-up in 1932 and 1933 . In 1935 , Real Betis , then known as Betis Balompié , won their only title to date . Primera División was suspended during the Spanish Civil War . In 1937 , the teams in the Republican area of Spain , with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs , competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions . Seventy years later , on 28 September 2007 , Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation ( Spanish acronym RFEF ) to recognise that title as a Liga title . This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise Levante FC \\'s Copa de la España Libre win as equivalent to Copa del Rey trophy . Nevertheless , the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet . 1940s : Atlético Madrid , Barcelona and Valencia emerge When the Primera División resumed after the Spanish Civil War , it was Atlético Aviación ( nowadays Atlético Madrid ) , Valencia , and FC Barcelona that emerged as the strongest clubs . Atlético were only awarded a place during the 1939–40 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo , whose ground had been damaged during the war . The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941 . While other clubs lost players to exile , execution , and as casualties of the war , the Atlético team was reinforced by a merger . The young , pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions , gaining three Liga titles in 1942 , 1944 , and 1947 . They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949 . Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era , finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946 . Meanwhile , on the other side of Spain , FC Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier . A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid , Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona . During his playing career with them , he scored 333 goals , won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey . In 1944 , Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945 . Under Samitier and legendary players César Rodríguez , Josep Escolà , Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo , Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s , winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949 . The 1940s proved to be a successful season for Barcelona , winning three La Liga titles and one Copa Del Rey , but the 1950s proved to be a decade of dominance , not just from Barcelona , but from Real Madrid . 1950s : Barcelona and Real Madrid dominate La Liga Although Atlético Madrid , previously known as Atlético Aviación , were champions in 1950 and 1951 under catenaccio mastermind Helenio Herrera , the 1950s continued the success FC Barcelona had during the late 1940s after they had won back to back La Liga titles . During this decade , Barcelona \\'s first golden era emerged . Under coach Ferdinand Daučík , FC Barcelona won back-to-back doubles , winning La Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1952 and 1953 . In 1952 , FC Barcelona made history yet again by winning five distinctive trophies in one year . This team , composed of László Kubala , Mariano Gonzalvo , César Rodríguez and Joan Segarra won La Liga , Copa Del Rey , Copa Eva Duarte ( predecessor of Spanish Super Cup ) , The Latin Cup and The Copa Martini Rossi . Their success in winning five trophies in one year earned them the name \\' L ’ equip de les cinc Copes \\' or The Team of The Five Cups . In the latter parts of the 1950s , coached by Helenio Herrera and featuring Luis Suárez , Barcelona won yet again their third set of back to back La Liga , winning them in 1959 and 1960 . In 1959 , FC Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey , conquering three doubles in the 1950s . The 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance . During the 1930s , 1940s , and 1950s , there were strict limits imposed on foreign players . In most cases , clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads , meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game . During the 1950s , however , these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalized Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás . Di Stéfano , Puskás , Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s . Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 — their first since 1933 — and retained their title in 1955 . In 1956 , Athletic Club won their sixth La Liga title , but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958 . All in all , Barcelona and Real Madrid won 4 La Liga titles each , with Atlético Madrid winning two Liga and Athletic Club winning one during this decade . 1960s–1970s : Real Madrid superiority Real Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980 , being crowned champions 14 times . Real Madrid won five La Liga titles in a row from 1961 to 1965 as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980 . During the 1960s and 1970s , only Atlético Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge . Atlético Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966 , 1970 , 1973 , and 1977 . Atlético Madrid also finished second place in 1961 , 1963 , and 1965 . In 1971 , Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di Stéfano , and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974 . 1980s : Real Madrid and the Basque Clubs Real Madrid \\'s monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s . Although Real Madrid won another five La Liga titles in a row from 1986 to 1990 under the brilliance of Emilio Butragueño and Hugo Sánchez , the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Club also dominated the 1980s . Real Sociedad won back-to-back La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982 , after leaving Real Madrid runner-up both times . Their title wins were followed by fellow Basque club Athletic Club , who won back-to-back titles in 1983 and 1984 , with Athletic Club winning their fifth La Liga and Copa Del Rey double in 1984 . Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables , their first La Liga win since 1974 . 1990s : Barcelona \\'s Dream Team Johan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988 , and assembled the legendary Dream Team . When Cruyff took hold of this Barcelona side they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 11 years . Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glorious days . This team was formed by international stars Romario , Michael Laudrup , Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman . Cruyff \\'s Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola , Albert Ferrer , and Guillermo Amor , as well as Spaniard Andoni Zubizarreta . Johan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played , and incorporated the principles of ‘ Total Football ’ into this team . The success of possession-based football was revolutionary , and Cruyff \\'s team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994 . In total , Cruyff won 11 trophies in eight years , making him the most successful manager in Barcelona \\'s history until the record was broken by his protégé Pep Guardiola two decades later . Barcelona \\'s run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995 . Atlético Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996 , as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double , before Real Madrid added another Liga to their cabinet in 1997 . After the success of Cruyff , another Dutchman – Ajax manager , Louis van Gaal – arrived at the Camp Nou , and with the talents of Luís Figo , Luis Enrique , and Rivaldo , Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999 , including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998 . All in all , Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s and continued their success throughout the 2000s . 2000s : Real Madrid , Barcelona and new challengers The 21st Century has continued the success FC Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff , dominating La Liga . Although Real Madrid have been prominent , Barcelona have created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s-1970s . Since the start of the new century , Barcelona have won 10 La Ligas , including two trebles and four doubles . This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions . Between 1999–2000 and 2004 , Deportivo La Coruña finished in the top three on five occasions , a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona , and in 2000 , under Javier Irureta , Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions . Valencia were also a very strong team in the early 2000s ; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Benítez . Real Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003 . With world-class players like Raúl , Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higuaín , Ronaldo , Roberto Carlos , Figo , Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006–07 and 2007–08 . FC Barcelona won their first title of the new century under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto \\' o in the 2004–2005 season . Barcelona retained the title and won it again in the 2005–2006 season . 2010s : Real Madrid and Barcelona continued dominance with Atletico on the rise Under the era of Pep Guardiola , powered by La Masia \\'s talent , such as Lionel Messi , Xavi and Andrés Iniesta , Barcelona added two straight Liga titles in 2009 and 2010 . FC Barcelona also became the first team in Spain to achieve the Treble in the 2008–09 season , consisting of winning the La Liga/Copa del Rey double and the UEFA Champions League . Barcelona won a third straight La Liga title in the 2010–11 season , but Real Madrid ended their winning streak in the 2011–2012 season under the management of José Mourinho . Real Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record at the time of 100 points . The following year , in the 2012–2013 season , Barcelona won yet again another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova , replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year . Atlético Madrid , under the management of Diego Simeone , won their tenth La Liga title in 2013–14 , their first since 1996 . Atlético Madrid became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid \\'s dominion over the league . In the 2014–15 season , under the trio of Messi , Neymar , and Suarez nicknamed \\'MSN \\' , Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second treble , and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double . Barcelona continued their dominance and in the 2015–16 season , won back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double , something that has not been achieved since the 1950s . Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016–17 , but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017–18 season , as well as winning their eighth double , for 7 La Liga titles in 10 years . Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018–19 season , for 8 La Liga titles in 11 years . Madrid reclaimed the title in 2019–20 , winning the season that was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic . Barça finished second , making it their twelfth consecutive placing in the top two , with eight victories . 2020s : Present The 2020–21 season started on September 12 . The teams participating in La Liga 2020–21 are Athletic Club de Bilbao , Atlético de Madrid , Barcelona , Betis , Cádiz , Eibar , Getafe , Huesca , Levante , Osasuna , Real Madrid , Real Sociedad , Sevilla , Valencia , Valladolid , Villarreal , Elche , Alavés , Eibar and Celta Vigo . The teams joining the Primera División , coming from Segunda are Cadiz , Elche and Huesca . Atletico Madrid won the 2020–21 season with Real Madrid as runners-up . In August 2021 , La Liga clubs approved a €2.7 billion deal to sell 10 % of the league to CVC Capital Partners . Clubs 20 teams contest the league in its current season , including the top 17 sides from the 2020–21 season and three promoted from the 2020–21 Segunda División . Espanyol and Mallorca were promoted directly , and Rayo Vallecano won the promotion play-off . La Liga clubs in Europe The Primera División is currently second in the UEFA rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period , behind England \\'s Premier League , but ahead of Italy \\'s Serie A and Germany \\'s Bundesliga . Real Madrid , Barcelona , and Valencia have been in the top ten most successful clubs in European football in terms of total European trophies . These three clubs , along with Sevilla and Atlético Madrid , are five of the most successful teams in European competition history ; these five are the only Spanish clubs to have won five or more international trophies . Deportivo La Coruña are the joint fifth-most participating Spanish team in the Champions League with Sevilla — after Real Madrid , Barcelona , Valencia , and Atlético Madrid — with five Champions League appearances in a row , including a semifinal appearance in 2003–04 . In 2005–06 , Barcelona won the Champions League and Sevilla won the UEFA Cup , making La Liga the first league to do the European \" double \" since 1997 . This feat was repeated in 2014 , 2015 , 2016 , and 2018 . On 25 August 2015 , La Liga became the first league to qualify five teams for the UEFA Champions League group stage ( Atlético Madrid , Barcelona , Real Madrid , Sevilla and Valencia ) . Champions Performance by club Performance comparison since 2010 Performance comparison of top teams since 2010 . Players Eligibility of non-EU players In La Liga in 2020 , each club is allowed five non-EU players but are only allowed to name three non-EU players in each matchday squad . Players can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from . If a player does not have European ancestry , he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years . Sometimes , this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation ; for example , Leo Franco , who was born in Argentina , is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport , having played in La Liga for over five years . In addition , players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa , the Caribbean , and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling . Individual awards Until the 2008–09 season , no official individual awards existed in La Liga . In the 2008–09 season , the governing body created the LFP Awards ( now called La Liga Awards ) , awarded each season to individual players and coaches . Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed , some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official . The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain \\'s largest sports paper , Marca , namely the Pichichi Trophy , awarded to the top scorer of the season ; the Ricardo Zamora Trophy , for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game ( minimum 28 games ) ; the Alfredo Di Stéfano Trophy , for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division ; and the Zarra Trophy , for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players . Since the 2013–14 season , La Liga has also bestowed the monthly manager of the month and player of the month awards . Transfers The first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the world record was Luis Suárez in 1961 , who moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152,000 ( £ million in ) . 12 years later , Johan Cruyff was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of £922,000 ( £ million in ) , when he moved from Ajax to Barcelona . In 1982 , Barcelona again set the record by signing Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors for £5 million ( £ million in ) . Real Betis set the world record in 1998 when they signed Denílson from São Paulo for £21.5 million ( £ million in ) . Four of the last six world transfer records have been set by Real Madrid , signing Luís Figo , Zinedine Zidane , Cristiano Ronaldo ( plus a deal for Kaká days before Ronaldo which fell just below a world record due to the way the fee was calculated ) and finally Gareth Bale , who was bought in 2013 for £85.3m ( €103.4m or $ 140m at the time ; £m in ) from Tottenham Hotspur . Brazilian forward Neymar was the subject of an expensive and complicated transfer arrangement when he joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013 , and his outgoing transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a new world record fee at €222m via his buyout clause . Barcelona soon invested a large amount of the money received from this transfer in a replacement , Ousmane Dembélé , whose deal – €105m – was the second most expensive ever before Philippe Coutinho \\'s transfer to Barcelona for €142m in January 2018 .

It has an area of , making it the third-largest lake in Italy , after Lake Garda and Lake Maggiore . At over deep , it is the fifth deepest lake in Europe , and the deepest outside Norway ; the bottom of the lake is more than below sea level . Lake Como has been a popular retreat for aristocrats and wealthy people since Roman times , and a very popular tourist attraction with many artistic and cultural gems . It has many villas and palaces such as Villa Olmo , Villa Serbelloni , and Villa Carlotta . Many famous people have had and have homes on the shores of Lake Como . One of its particularities is its characteristic \" Y \" shape , which forms the so-called \" Larian Triangle \" , with the little town of Canzo as its capital . In 2014 , The Huffington Post called it the most beautiful lake in the world for its microclimate and environment with prestigious villas and villages . Etymology The lake \\'s name in Latin is Larius , Italianised as Lario , but this name is rarely used ; it is usually called Lago di Como ( literally \" lake of Como \" ) . In guidebooks the lake may be variously referred to as Lake Como , Lake of Como , or Como Lake . Its name comes from the city of Como , known to the Romans as Comum . Geography The lake is shaped much like an inverted letter \" Y \" . The northern branch begins at the town of Colico , while the towns of Como and Lecco sit at the ends of the southwestern and southeastern branches respectively . The small towns of Bellagio , Menaggio and Varenna are situated at the intersection of the three branches of the lake : a triangular boat service operates between them . Lake Como is fed primarily by the Adda , which enters the lake near Colico and flows out at Lecco . This geological conformation makes the southwestern branch a dead end , and so Como , unlike Lecco , is often flooded . The mountainous pre-alpine territory between the two southern arms of the lake ( between Como , Bellagio , and Lecco ) is known as the Larian Triangle , or Triangolo lariano . The source of the river Lambro is here . At the centre of the triangle , the town of Canzo is the seat of the Comunità montana del Triangolo lariano , an association of the 31 municipalities that represent the 71,000 inhabitants of the area . Climate Lake Como weather is humid subtropical ( Cfa in the Köppen climate classification ) . In the winter , the lake helps to maintain a higher temperature in the surrounding region . Average daily temperatures range from about in January to in July , according to historical weather data from Como . Water temperatures can reach an average of during the month of July . Snowfall is erratic and primarily affects the higher elevations . Rainfall is heaviest in May and lowest during the winter months . Tourism As a tourist destination , Lake Como is popular for its landscapes , wildlife , and spas . It is a venue for sailing , windsurfing , and kitesurfing . In 1818 Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote to Thomas Love Peacock : \" This lake exceeds anything I ever beheld in beauty , with the exception of the arbutus islands of Killarney . It is long and narrow , and has the appearance of a mighty river winding among the mountains and the forests \" . In the area surrounding Lake Como there are several farms which produce goods such as honey , olive oil , cheese , milk , eggs and salamis . Visitors can find lists of these farms and typically visit the farm itself in person to make their purchases . In 2018 , the Italian luxury label Dolce and Gabbana held a fashion event on Lake Como . Lakeside villas The lake is well known for the attractive villas that have been built there since Roman times , when Pliny the Younger built the Comedia and the Tragedia resorts . Many villas on the lake shores have admirable gardens that benefit from the mild climate induced by the stabilizing presence of of lake water and can sustain many subtropical and Mediterranean plants . Villa Carlotta was built for the Milanese Marquis Giorgio Clerici in 1690 and occupies a site of over at Tremezzo , facing the Bellagio peninsula . An Italian garden ( with steps , fountains , and sculptures ) was laid out at the same time . The villa was later sold to powerful banker and Napoleonic politician Giovanni Battista Sommariva . Stendhal was his guest in 1818 , and his visit is recalled at the start of La Chartreuse de Parme . In 1843 it was purchased by Princess Marianne of Nassau as a wedding present for her daughter Carlotta , after whom the villa is now named . The latter , together with her husband Georg II of Saxen-Meiningen , laid out the woodland landscape park in Romantic style . The villa today includes a museum of agricultural implements as well as important works of sculpture by Sommariva \\'s friend Antonio Canova and by Luigi Acquisti . Villa d\\'Este , in Cernobbio , was built in 1568 by Cardinal Tolomeo Gallio , a native of the town . In 1816–1817 the villa was home to Caroline of Brunswick , estranged wife of the Prince of Wales and shortly to become Queen Consort of King George IV of the United Kingdom . The landscaped gardens in the English style are a product of this period . Later in the century it was turned into a luxury hotel . Today the Villa d\\'Este is known for attracting celebrity guests . Villa del Balbianello , famous for its elaborate terraced gardens , lies on a promontory of the western shore of the lake near Isola Comacina . Built in 1787 on the site of a Franciscan monastery , it was the final home of the explorer Guido Monzino and today houses a museum devoted to his work . Villa Melzi d\\'Eril in Bellagio was built in neo-classical style by architect Giocondo Albertolli in 1808–1810 as the summer residence of Duke Francesco Melzi d\\'Eril , who was vice-president of the Napoleonic Italian Republic . The park includes an orangery , a private chapel , fine statues , and a Japanese garden , and is planted , as often on lake Como , with huge rhododendrons . 19th-century guests at the Villa included Stendhal and Franz Liszt . Villa Serbelloni , also in Bellagio , hosts the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center , a international conference center set up and managed by the Rockefeller Foundation since 1959 , which also operates a \" scholar-in-residence \" program for scholars from around the world . This is believed to have been the site of Pliny the Younger \\'s villa \" Tragedia \" . Its well-known park was created at the end of the 18th century by Alessandro Serbelloni . Many famous people have or have had homes on the shores of Lake Como , such as Matthew Bellamy , John Kerry , Madonna , George Clooney , Gianni Versace , Ronaldinho , Sylvester Stallone , Julian Lennon , Richard Branson , Ben Spies , Pierina Legnani , Lionel Messi and José Mourinho . Ferries The Lake Como ferry service is a highly developed public transport system linking the many small towns around the Lake . A motorized service began in 1826 when a steamship with sails , the \" Lario \" , was launched by the newly established Società privilegiata per l\\'impresa dei battelli a vapore nel Regno Lombardo Veneto . Since 1952 the system has been run under the auspices of a government organization called first the Gestione Commissariale Governativa and subsequently the Gestione Governativa Navigazione Laghi , which is also responsible for services on Lake Maggiore and Lake Garda . Today there are three main services : Motorship services along the western branch and northern end of the Lake ( between Colico or Piona and Como town ) , with additional shuttles to the mid-lake area . Fast services that follow broadly the same route , but use faster hydrofoils , stop less frequently , and cost extra . Ferries that run only between the popular mid-lake villages of Menaggio , Bellagio , and Varenna , plus Cadenabbia . Some of these boats carry vehicles as well as passengers . Sacro Monte di Ossuccio The Sacro Monte di Ossuccio ( \" Holy Mount of Ossuccio \" ) is a sanctuary located on a hillside slope between olive groves and woods along the western edge of Lake Como facing Isola Comacina . Fifteen Baroque inspired chapels , built between 1635 and 1710 , and dedicated to the Mysteries of the Rosary are dotted along the way that leads to the Monastery . This building is the last in the chain and is dedicated to the Coronation of the Virgin . In 2003 , the Sacri Monti of Piedmont and Lombardy , including that of Ossuccio , were added by UNESCO to the World Heritage List .

He is considered one of the greatest strikers of all time and one of the greatest players in the history of the Premier League . In 2003 and 2004 , Henry was the runner-up for the FIFA World Player of the Year , and was runner-up for the Ballon d\\'Or in the former year . He was named the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year twice , the FWA Footballer of the Year three times , and was named in the PFA Team of the Year six consecutive times . He was also included in the FIFA FIFPro World XI once and the UEFA Team of the Year five times . He was one of the most commercially marketed footballers during the 2000s . Henry , along with Alan Shearer , was one of the inaugural inductees into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021 . Henry made his professional debut with Monaco in 1994 before signing for defending Serie A champions Juventus . However , limited playing time , coupled with disagreements with the club \\'s hierarchy , led to him signing for English Premier League club Arsenal for £11 million in 1999 . Under long-time mentor and coach Arsène Wenger , Henry became a prolific striker and Arsenal \\'s all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all competitions . He won the Premier League Golden Boot a record four times , won two FA Cups and two Premier League titles with the club , including one during an unbeaten season dubbed The Invincibles . He spent his final two seasons with Arsenal as club captain , leading them to the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final . In June 2007 , he transferred to Barcelona . In the 2008–09 season , Henry was a key part of the club \\'s historic treble when they won La Liga , the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League . In 2010 , he joined New York Red Bulls of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) , but returned to Arsenal on loan for two months in 2012 , before retiring in 2014 . Henry enjoyed sustained success with France , winning the 1998 FIFA World Cup , UEFA Euro 2000 and 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup . He was named the French Player of the Year a record five times . He was also named to the UEFA Euro 2000 Team of the Tournament , awarded both the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup Golden Ball and Golden Shoe , and was named to the 2006 FIFA World Cup All-Star Team . In October 2007 , he became his country \\'s record goalscorer . After amassing 123 appearances and 51 goals , Henry retired from international football after the 2010 FIFA World Cup . After retiring , Henry transitioned into coaching . He began coaching Arsenal \\'s youth teams in February 2015 , in tandem with his work as a pundit for Sky Sports . In 2016 , he was appointed as an assistant coach at Belgium , before assuming the role as the head coach at former club Monaco in 2018 . He was relieved of his duties at Monaco in January 2019 and returned to MLS less than a year later to manage Montréal Impact . He led Montréal to the playoffs in the 2020 season before stepping down in 2021 . Early years Henry is of Antillean heritage : his father , Antoine , is from Guadeloupe ( La Désirade island ) , and his mother , Maryse , is from Martinique . He was born and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which , despite sometimes being seen as a tough neighbourhood , provided good footballing facilities . As a seven-year-old , Henry showed great potential , prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis . His father pressured him to attend training , although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football . He joined US Palaiseau in 1989 , but after a year his father fell out with the club , so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years . US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza , Henry \\'s future mentor , followed him there . Club career 1992–1999 : Beginnings at Monaco and transfer to Juventus In 1990 , Monaco sent scout Arnold Catalano to watch Henry , then at the age of 13 in a match . Henry scored all six goals as his side won 6–0 . Catalano asked him to join Monaco without even attending a trial first . Catalano requested that Henry complete a course at the elite INF Clairefontaine academy , and despite the director \\'s reluctance to admit Henry due to his poor school results , he was allowed to complete the course and joined Arsène Wenger \\'s Monaco as a youth player . Subsequently , Henry signed professional forms with Monaco , and made his professional debut on 31 August 1994 , in a 2–0 loss against Nice . Although Wenger suspected that Henry should be deployed as a striker , he put Henry on the left wing because he believed that his pace , natural ball control and skill would be more effective against full backs than centre-backs . After a tentative start to his Monaco career , Henry was named the French Young Footballer of the Year in 1996 , and in the 1996–97 season , his solid performances helped the club win the Ligue 1 title . During the 1997–98 season , he was instrumental in leading his club to the UEFA Champions League semi-final , setting a French record by scoring seven goals in the competition . By his third season , he had received his first cap for the national team , and was part of the winning team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup . He continued to impress at his tenure with Monaco , and in his five seasons with the French club , the young winger scored 20 league goals in 105 appearances . Henry left Monaco in January 1999 , one year before his intimate and closest teammate David Trezeguet , and moved to Italian club Juventus for £10.5 million . He played on the wing , as well as at wing back and wide midfield , but he was ineffective as a goal scorer , struggling against the defensive discipline exhibited by teams in Serie A , registering just three goals in 16 appearances . In 2019 , on Jamie Carragher ’ s podcast The Greatest Game , Henry attributed disagreements with Juve director Luciano Moggi as his rationale behind departing the club . 1999–2007 : Move to Arsenal , breakthrough , and success Unsettled in Italy , Henry transferred from Juventus on 3 August 1999 to Arsenal for an estimated fee of £11 million , reuniting with his former manager Arsène Wenger . It was at Arsenal that Henry made his name as a world-class footballer , and although his transfer was not without controversy , Wenger was convinced he was worth the transfer fee . Brought in as a replacement for fellow French forward Nicolas Anelka , Henry was immediately moulded into a striker by Wenger , a move that would pay rich dividends in years to come . However , doubts were raised about his ability to adapt to the quick and physical English game when he failed to score in his first eight games . After several difficult months in England , Henry even conceded that he had to \" be re-taught everything about the art of striking . \" These doubts were dispelled when he ended his first season at Arsenal with an impressive goal tally of 26 . Arsenal finished second in the Premier League behind Manchester United , and lost in the UEFA Cup Final against Turkish club Galatasaray . Coming off the back of a victorious UEFA Euro 2000 campaign with the national team , Henry was ready to make an impact in the 2000–01 season . Despite recording fewer goals and assists than his first season , Henry \\'s second season with Arsenal proved to be a breakthrough , as he became the club \\'s top goalscorer . His goal tally included a spectacular strike against Manchester United where he flicked the ball up ( with his back turned to goal ) , before he swivelled and volleyed in from 30 yards out . The strike also featured a memorable goal celebration where he recreated the Budweiser \" Whassup ? \" advertisement . Armed with one of the league \\'s best attacks , Arsenal finished runner-up to perennial rivals Manchester United in the Premier League . The team also reached the final of the FA Cup , losing 2–1 to Liverpool . Henry remained frustrated , however , by the fact that he had yet to help the club win honours , and frequently expressed his desire to establish Arsenal as a powerhouse . Success finally arrived during the 2001–02 season . Arsenal finished seven points above Liverpool to win the Premier League title , and defeated Chelsea 2–0 in the FA Cup Final . Henry became the league \\'s top goalscorer and netted 32 goals in all competitions as he led Arsenal to a double and his first silverware with the club . There was much expectation that Henry would replicate his club form for France during the 2002 FIFA World Cup , but the defending champions suffered a shock exit at the group stage . 2002–03 proved to be another productive season for Henry , as he scored 32 goals in all competitions while contributing 23 assists—remarkable returns for a striker . In doing so , he led Arsenal to another FA Cup triumph ( where he was man-of-the-match in the Final ) , although Arsenal failed to retain their Premier League title . Throughout the season , he competed with Manchester United \\'s Ruud van Nistelrooy for the league scoring title , but the Dutchman edged Henry to the Golden Boot by a single goal . Nonetheless , Henry was named both the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year . His rising status as one of the world \\'s best footballers was affirmed when he emerged runner-up for the 2003 FIFA World Player of the Year award . With 24 goals and 20 assists in the league , Henry set a new record for most assists in a single Premier League season , and also became the first player in history to record at least 20 goals and 20 assists in a single season in one of Europe \\'s top–five leagues—this feat has since been matched by Lionel Messi in 2020 . Entering the 2003–04 season , Arsenal were determined to reclaim the Premier League crown . Henry was again instrumental in Arsenal \\'s exceptionally successful campaign ; together with the likes of Dennis Bergkamp , Patrick Vieira , Freddie Ljungberg and Robert Pires , Henry ensured that the Gunners became the first team in more than a century to go through the entire domestic league season unbeaten , claiming the league title in the process . Apart from being named for the second year running as the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year and FWA Footballer of the Year , Henry emerged once again as the runner-up for 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year award . With 39 goals scored in all competitions , the Frenchman led the league in goals scored and won the European Golden Boot . However , as was the case in 2002 , Henry was unable to lead the national side to honours during UEFA Euro 2004 . This dip in success was compounded when Arsenal failed again to secure back-to-back league titles when they lost out to Chelsea in the 2004–05 season , although Arsenal did win the FA Cup ( the Final of which Henry missed through injury ) . Henry maintained his reputation as one of Europe \\'s most feared strikers as he led the league in scoring , and with 31 goals in all competitions , he was the co-recipient ( with Diego Forlán ) of the European Golden Boot , becoming the first player to officially win the award twice in a row ( Ally McCoist had won two Golden Boots in a row , but both were deemed unofficial ) . The unexpected departure of Arsenal \\'s captain Patrick Vieira in the 2005 close season led to Henry being awarded club captaincy , a role which many felt was not naturally suited for him ; the captaincy is more commonly given to defenders or midfielders , who are better-placed on the pitch to read the game . Along with being chief goalscorer , he was responsible for leading a very young team which had yet to gel fully . The 2005–06 season proved to be one of remarkable personal achievements for Henry . On 17 October 2005 , Henry became the club \\'s top goalscorer of all time ; two goals against Sparta Prague in the Champions League meant he broke Ian Wright \\'s record of 185 goals . On 1 February 2006 , he scored a goal against West Ham United , bringing his league goal tally up to 151 , breaking Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin \\'s league goals record . Henry scored his 100th league goal at Highbury , a feat unparalleled in the history of the club , and a unique achievement in the Premier League . On the final day of the Premier League season , Henry scored a hat-trick against Wigan Athletic in the last match played at Highbury . He completed the season as the league \\'s top goalscorer , was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year for the third time in his career , and was selected in the FIFA World XI . Nevertheless , Arsenal failed to win the Premier League title again , but hopes of a trophy were revived when Arsenal reached the 2006 UEFA Champions League Final . The Gunners eventually lost 2–1 to Barcelona , with Henry assisting the team \\'s only goal from a free kick , and Arsenal \\'s inability to win the league title for two consecutive seasons combined with the relative inexperience of the Arsenal squad caused much speculation that Henry would leave for another club . However , he declared his love for the club and accepted a four-year contract , and said he would stay at Arsenal for life . Arsenal vice-chairman David Dein later claimed the club had turned down two bids of £50 million from Spanish clubs for Henry before the signing of the new contract . Had the transfer materialised , it would have surpassed the then-world record £47 million paid for Zinedine Zidane . Henry \\'s 2006–07 season was marred by injuries . Although he scored 10 goals in 17 domestic appearances for Arsenal , Henry \\'s season was cut short in February . Having missed games due to hamstring , foot , and back problems , he was deemed fit enough to come on as a late substitute against PSV in a Champions League match , but began limping shortly after coming on . Scans the next day revealed that he would need at least three months to heal from new groin and stomach injuries , missing the rest of the 2006–07 season . Wenger attributed Henry \\'s injuries to a protracted 2005–06 campaign , and reiterated that Henry was keen on staying with the Gunners to rebuild for the 2007–08 season . 2007–2010 : Barcelona and a historic treble On 25 June 2007 , in an unexpected turn of events , Henry was transferred to Barcelona for €24 million . He signed a four-year deal for a reported €6.8 ( £4.6 ) million per season . It was revealed that the contract included a release clause of €125 ( £84.9 ) million . Henry cited the departure of Dein and continued uncertainty over Wenger \\'s future as reasons for leaving , and maintained that \" I always said that if I ever left Arsenal it would be to play for Barcelona . \" Despite their captain \\'s departure , Arsenal got off to an impressive start for the 2007–08 campaign , and Henry said that his presence in the team might have been more of a hindrance than a help . He stated , \" Because of my seniority , the fact that I was captain and my habit of screaming for the ball , they would sometimes give it to me even when I was not in the best position . So in that sense it was good for the team that I moved on . \" Henry left Arsenal as the club \\'s leading all-time league goalscorer with 174 goals and leading all-time goalscorer in European competitions with 42 goals ; in July 2008 , Arsenal fans voted him as Arsenal \\'s greatest player ever in Arsenal.com \\'s Gunners \\' Greatest 50 Players poll . At Barcelona , Henry was given the number 14 jersey , the same as he had worn at Arsenal . He scored his first goal for his new club on 19 September 2007 in a 3–0 Champions League group stage win over Lyon , and he recorded his first hat-trick for Barça in a Primera División match against Levante ten days later . But with Henry mostly deployed on the wing throughout the season , he was unable to reproduce the goal-scoring form he achieved with Arsenal . He expressed dissatisfaction with the move to Barcelona in the initial year , amidst widespread speculation of a return to the Premier League . In an interview with Garth Crooks on BBC ’ s Football Focus , Henry described missing life \" back home \" and even \" the English press . \" However , Henry concluded his debut season as the club \\'s top scorer with 19 goals in addition to nine league assists , second behind Lionel Messi \\'s ten . Henry went on to surpass this tally in a more integrated 2008–09 campaign , with 26 goals and 10 assists from the left wing . He won the first trophy of his Barcelona career on 13 May 2009 when Barcelona defeated Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final . Barcelona won the Primera División and UEFA Champions League soon after , completing a treble for the Frenchman , who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto \\' o to score 100 goals between them that season . The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history , scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid \\'s Ferenc Puskás , Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season ( this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo , Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuaín who scored 89 goals in 2011–12 ) . Later in 2009 , Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple , consisting of the aforementioned treble , the Supercopa de España , the UEFA Super Cup , and the FIFA Club World Cup . The following season , the emergence of Pedro meant that Henry only started 15 league games . Before the La Liga season ended , and with a year still left on his contract , club president Joan Laporta stated on 5 May 2010 that Henry \" may go away in the summer transfer window if that \\'s what he wants . \" After Henry returned from the 2010 World Cup , Barcelona confirmed that they had agreed to the sale of Henry to an unnamed club , with the player still to agree terms with the new club . 2010–2014 : New York Red Bulls and retirement In July 2010 , Henry signed a multi-year contract with Major League Soccer ( MLS ) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player . He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2–2 draw against Houston Dynamo , assisting both goals to Juan Pablo Ángel . His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2–0 victory against San Jose Earthquakes . The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew before losing 3–2 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs . The next season , the Red Bulls were 10th overall in the league , and bowed out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs . Return to Arsenal ( loan ) After training with Arsenal during the MLS off-season , Henry re-signed for the club on a two-month loan deal on 6 January 2012 . This was to provide cover for Gervinho and Marouane Chamakh , who were unavailable due to their participation in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations . Henry was given the number 12 jersey – his old Arsenal number 14 jersey , the same number he wore at Barcelona and New York , was unavailable , with Theo Walcott inheriting it following Henry \\'s departure from the club in 2007 . Henry made his second Arsenal debut as a substitute against Leeds United in the FA Cup third round and scored the only goal . In his last league game on loan , he scored the winning goal in stoppage time in a 2–1 win against Sunderland . His final goals for the club meant he finished his Arsenal career with a record 228 goals ; 175 of them came in the Premier League . Return to New York Red Bulls On 17 February 2012 , Henry returned to Red Bulls to prepare for the 2012 season . His base salary of $ 5 million ( $ 5.6 million guaranteed ) made him the highest-paid player in MLS—surpassing David Beckham , who had taken a salary cut for his last year with the Los Angeles Galaxy . In 2013 , Henry \\'s base salary dropped to $ 3.75 million setting him behind Robbie Keane \\'s $ 4 million base salary . With bonuses , however , Henry remained the highest-paid player with $ 4.35 million compared to Keane \\'s $ 4.33 million . On 31 March 2012 , Henry scored his first MLS hat-trick in a 5–2 Red Bulls win over the Montreal Impact . He was named MLS Player of the Month that same month . On 27 October 2013 , Henry scored once and provided two assists in the last game of the season against the Chicago Fire at Red Bull Arena to help his team win 5–2 and become champions of the regular season . It was the club \\'s first major trophy in their 17-year history . On 12 July 2014 , Henry provided a goal and three assists in a 4–1 Red Bulls win over the Columbus Crew . With that effort he became the all-time assist leader for the New York Red Bulls with 37 , surpassing Amado Guevara and Tab Ramos . On 1 December 2014 , it was announced that Henry had left the Red Bulls after four-and-a-half years at the club . On 16 December , he announced his retirement as a player and stated that he would begin working for Sky Sports as a pundit . After working at Sky for over three years , Henry quit his position in July 2018 to focus on his career as a coach . International career Henry enjoyed a successful career with the France national team , winning the first of his 123 caps in June 1997 , when his good form for Monaco was rewarded with a call-up to the Under-20 French national team , where he played in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship alongside future teammates William Gallas and David Trezeguet . Within four months , France head coach Aimé Jacquet called Henry up to the senior team . The 20-year-old made his senior international debut on 11 October 1997 in a 2–1 win against South Africa . Jacquet was so impressed with Henry that he took him to the 1998 FIFA World Cup . Although Henry was a largely unknown quantity at international level , he ended the tournament as France \\'s top scorer with three goals . He was scheduled to appear as a substitute in the final , where France beat Brazil 3–0 , but Marcel Desailly \\'s sending off forced a defensive change instead . In 1998 , he was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour , France \\'s highest decoration . Henry was a member of France \\'s UEFA Euro 2000 squad , again scoring three goals in the tournament , including the equaliser against Portugal in the semi-final , and finishing as the country \\'s top scorer . France later won the game in extra time following a converted penalty kick by Zinedine Zidane . France went on to defeat Italy in extra-time in the final , earning Henry his second major international medal . During the tournament , Henry was voted man of the match in three games , including the final against Italy . The 2002 FIFA World Cup featured a stunning early exit for both Henry and France as the defending champions were eliminated in the group stage after failing to score a goal in all three games . France lost against Senegal in their first group match and Henry was red carded for a dangerous sliding challenge in their next match against Uruguay . In that game , France played to a 0–0 draw , but Henry was forced to miss the final group match due to suspension ; France lost 2–0 to Denmark . Henry returned to form for his country at the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup . Despite playing without team stalwarts Zidane and Patrick Vieira , France won , in large part owing to Henry \\'s outstanding play , for which he was named Man of the Match by FIFA \\'s Technical Study Group in three of France \\'s five matches . In the final , he scored the golden goal in extra time to lift the title for the host country after a 1–0 victory over Cameroon . Henry was awarded both the Adidas Golden Ball as the outstanding player of the competition and the Adidas Golden Shoe as the tournament \\'s top goalscorer with four goals . In UEFA Euro 2004 , Henry played in all of France \\'s matches and scored two goals . France beat England in the group stage but lost to the eventual winners Greece 1–0 in the quarter-finals . During the 2006 FIFA World Cup Henry remained as one of the automatic starters in the squad . He played as a lone striker , but despite an indifferent start to the tournament , became one of the top players of the World Cup . He scored three goals , including the winning goal from Zidane \\'s free kick against defending champions Brazil in the quarter-final . However , France subsequently lost to Italy on penalties ( 5–3 ) in the final . Henry did not take part in the penalty shoot-out , having been substituted in extra time after his legs had cramped . Henry was one of ten nominees for the Golden Ball award for Player of the Tournament , an award which was ultimately presented to his teammate , Zidane and was named a starting striker on the 2006 FIFPro World XI team . On 13 October 2007 , Henry scored his 41st goal against the Faroe Islands , joining Michel Platini as the country \\'s top goalscorer of all time . Four days later at the Stade de la Beaujoire , he scored a late double against Lithuania , thereby setting a new record as France \\'s top goalscorer . On 3 June 2008 , Henry made his 100th appearance for the national team in a match against Colombia , becoming the sixth French player ever to reach that milestone . Henry missed the opening game of France \\'s short-lived UEFA Euro 2008 campaign , where they were eliminated in the group stages after being drawn in the same group as Italy , the Netherlands and Romania . He scored France \\'s only goal in the competition in a 4–1 loss to the Netherlands . The French team struggled during the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifiers and finished second in their group behind Serbia . During the play-offs against the Republic of Ireland , Henry was involved in a controversy in the second leg of the game at the Stade de France on 18 November 2009 . With the aggregate score tied at 1–1 and the game in extra time , he used his hand twice to control the ball before delivering a cross to William Gallas who scored the winner . This sparked a barrage of criticism against the Frenchman , while national team coach Raymond Domenech and Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger defended him . The Football Association of Ireland lodged a formal complaint with FIFA , seeking a replay of the game , which FIFA declined . Henry said that he contemplated retiring from international football after the reactions to the incident , but maintained that he was not a \" cheat \" ; hours after FIFA had ruled out a replay , he stated that \" the fairest solution would be to replay the game \" . FIFA President Sepp Blatter described the incident as \" blatant unfair play \" and announced an inquiry into how such incidents could be avoided in future , and added that the incident would be investigated by the Disciplinary Committee . Blatter also said Henry told him that his family had been threatened in the aftermath of the incident . In January 2010 , FIFA announced that there was no legal basis to sanction Henry . Henry did not feature in the starting line-up for France at the 2010 FIFA World Cup . France drew in their first game against Uruguay , and lost 2–0 in their second against Mexico . The team was thrown into disarray when Nicolas Anelka was expelled from the team , and captain Patrice Evra led a team protest by refusing to train . In the final group game against host-nation South Africa in which Henry came on as a second-half substitute , France lost 2–1 and were eliminated from the tournament . He then announced his retirement from international football , having won 123 caps and scored 51 goals for Les Bleus , thus finishing his international career as France \\'s all-time top scorer , and second most capped player after Lilian Thuram . Style of play Although Henry played up front as a striker during his youth , he spent his time at Monaco and Juventus playing on the wing . When Henry joined Arsenal in 1999 , Wenger immediately changed this , switching Henry to his childhood position , often pairing him with Dutch veteran Dennis Bergkamp . During the 2004–05 season , Wenger switched Arsenal \\'s formation to 4–5–1 . This change forced Henry to adapt again to fit into the Arsenal team , and he played many games as a lone striker . Still , Henry remained Arsenal \\'s main offensive threat , on many occasions conjuring spectacular goals . Wenger said of his fellow Frenchman : \" Thierry Henry could take the ball in the middle of the park and score a goal that no one else in the world could score \" . One of the reasons cited for Henry \\'s impressive play up front is his ability to calmly score from one-on-ones . According to his father Antoine , Henry learned precision shooting from watching his idol Marco van Basten . He was also influenced by Romário , Ronaldo and Liberian star George Weah , a new breed of strikers in the 1990s who would also operate outside the penalty area before running with the ball towards goal . At his physical peak from the late 1990s to the mid 2000s , Henry \\'s ability to dribble past opponents with exceptional pace , skill and composure , meant that he could get in behind defenders regularly enough to score . In 2004 , former Arsenal striker Alan Smith commented on Henry : \" I have to say I have n\\'t seen a player like him . He \\'s an athlete with great technical ability and a tremendous desire to be the best . \" When up front , Henry is occasionally known to move out wide to the left wing position , something which enables him to contribute heavily in assists : between 2002–03 and 2004–05 , the striker managed almost 50 assists in total and this was attributed to his unselfish play and creativity . Ranking Henry the greatest player in Premier League history , in February 2020 FourFourTwo magazine stated , \" No one assisted more in a season . No one has terrorised defenders with such a combination of bewitching grace and phenomenal power . \" Coming in from the left , Henry \\'s trademark finish saw him place the ball inside the far right corner of the goal . Henry would also drift offside to fool the defence then run back onside before the ball is played and beat the offside trap , although he never provided Arsenal a distinct aerial threat . Given his versatility in being able to operate as both a winger and a striker , the Frenchman is not a prototypical \" out-and-out striker \" , but he has emerged consistently as one of Europe \\'s most prolific strikers . In set pieces , Henry was the first-choice penalty and free kick taker for Arsenal , scoring regularly from those positions . Henry was also a notable exponent of a no-look pass where he would feint to pass the ball with his right foot , but would make contact with the ball using his standing foot ( his left ) . Managerial career Arsenal youth Henry began coaching Arsenal \\'s youth teams in February 2015 , in tandem with his work for Sky Sports . His influence on the team was praised by players such as Alex Iwobi , who dedicated a goal against Bayern Munich in the 2015–16 UEFA Youth League to his advice . Having earned a UEFA A Licence , he was offered the job of under-18 coach by Academy head Andries Jonker , but the decision was overruled by Wenger , who wanted a full-time coach for the team . Belgium ( assistant ) In August 2016 , Henry became second assistant coach of the Belgium national team , working alongside head coach Roberto Martínez and fellow assistant Graeme Jones . In an interview with NBC Sports , Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku praised Henry for his work with him , stating , \" Henry is the best thing that has happened to me because since I came to England aged 18 I have had the best mentors . Thierry for me is the best . Every day whether it is positive and negative I take it in my stride because I know what is expected from the top level . ” At the 2018 FIFA World Cup , Belgium reached the semi-final , but lost to Henry \\'s home nation France 1–0 . Henry picked up a Bronze medal after Belgium defeated England 2–0 in the third-place play-off to secure their best ever World Cup finish . Henry was reportedly offered the position of head coach by Bordeaux in August 2018 . However , the offer was not accepted by Henry after disagreements with the club \\'s owners . Days after turning down the Bordeaux job , and following Jones \\'s departure from the Belgium national team , Henry , who had been the forwards coach , was promoted to Belgium assistant coach . However , his tenure in the role was short-lived , after he accepted the role as head coach at former club Monaco in October . Monaco On 11 October 2018 , Monaco dismissed Leonardo Jardim as club manager . Jardim \\'s position had become untenable after struggling heavily in domestic competition , with the club 18th at the time of his departure , and disputes over the club \\'s transfer policy . Monaco \\'s search for a new coach coincided with the regulatory mid-season international break , allowing the club sufficient time to search for a replacement , however , they quickly decided on Henry , and he was appointed a mere two days later . He signed a three-year deal , and was unveiled as Monaco manager on 18 October . At his first press conference , he told reporters : \" This club will always have a big place in my heart , so to be able to come here and start again , it is a dream come true . There is a lot of work to do , as you can imagine – but I am more than happy to be here \" . Henry \\'s arrival at Monaco was greeted with mixed reactions by some media outlets , due to his relative inexperience as a top-level coach and the task of overturning Monaco \\'s misfortunes . Despite inheriting a squad of sub-standard quality , Henry expressed a desire of replicating the football he played under Pep Guardiola at Barcelona , as well as instilling the \" professionalism \" taught to him by Arsène Wenger . Henry also adopted a hands-on approach to training sessions , being regularly involved in devising schemes and instructing drills . His first match was a 2–1 away defeat against Strasbourg on 20 October . He was unable to secure a win for over a month , enduring a period which included two high-profile defeats against Club Brugge and Paris Saint-Germain , prior to defeating Caen on 1–0 on 25 November . He secured two wins in December , defeating Amiens in the league and Lorient in the Coupe de la Ligue , however , this was on the backdrop of three additional Ligue 1 defeats to close 2018 in the relegation zone . In January 2019 , Henry entered the winter transfer window , where he signed left-back Fodé Ballo-Touré , and former Arsenal teammate Cesc Fàbregas from Chelsea . He also sanctioned the loan signing of French defensive midfielder William Vainqueur on 12 January , and experienced defender Naldo . However , these signings would not turn around the club \\'s fate , and on 24 January , Henry was dismissed at Monaco . The club were 19th at the time of his departure , and Henry left with a record of 4 wins , 5 draws , and 11 defeats , from 20 games in charge . Montreal Impact On 14 November 2019 , Henry signed with Major League Soccer side Montreal Impact , signing a two-year deal until the end of the 2021 season , with an option to extend it by a year until the 2022 season . In his first press conference , Henry stated he had to \" confront \" the relative disappointment of his short stint as manager of Monaco , before undertaking a new job . After leading Montreal to their first playoff berth in four seasons , on 25 February 2021 , prior to the 2021 season , Henry stepped down as head coach of the renamed CF Montreal to be closer to his children in London . He had not been able to see them in the 2020 season due to travel restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic , and with restrictions continuing into the 2021 season , he decided to end the separation . Return to Belgium ( assistant ) In May 2021 , Henry rejoined the coaching staff of Belgium prior to the UEFA Euro 2020 . Reception Henry has received many plaudits and awards in his football career . He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards ; in those two seasons , he also won back-to-back PFA Players \\' Player of the Year titles . Henry is the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times ( 2003 , 2004 , 2006 ) , and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions . Henry was voted into the Premier League Overseas Team of the Decade in the 10 Seasons Awards poll in 2003 , and in 2004 he was named by football legend Pelé on the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . In terms of goal-scoring awards , Henry was the European Golden Boot winner in 2004 and 2005 ( sharing it with Villarreal \\'s Diego Forlán in 2005 ) . Henry was also the top goalscorer in the Premier League for a record four seasons ( 2002 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 ) . In 2006 , he became the first player to score more than 20 goals in the league for five consecutive seasons ( 2002 to 2006 ) . With 175 , Henry is currently sixth in the list of all-time Premier League goalscorers , behind Alan Shearer , Wayne Rooney , Andy Cole , Sergio Agüero , and Frank Lampard . He held the record for most goals in the competition for one club , until it was broken by Rooney in 2016 , and held the record for most goals by a foreign player in the competition until surpassed by Agüero in 2020 . France \\'s all-time record goalscorer was , in his prime in the mid 2000s , regarded by many coaches , footballers and journalists as one of the best players in the world . In November 2007 , he was ranked 33rd on the Association of Football Statisticians \\' compendium for \" Greatest Ever Footballers . \" Arsenal fans honoured their former player in 2008 , declaring Henry the greatest Arsenal player . In two other 2008 surveys , Henry emerged as the favourite Premier League player of all time among 32,000 people surveyed in the Barclays 2008 Global Fan Report . Arsenal fan and The Who lead singer Roger Daltrey mentions Henry in the tribute song \" Highbury Highs \" , which he performed at Arsenal \\'s last game at Highbury on 7 May 2006 . On 10 December 2011 , Arsenal unveiled a bronze statue of Henry at the Emirates Stadium as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations . In 2017 , FourFourTwo magazine ranked him first in their list of the 30 best strikers in Premier League history . Daniel Girard of The Toronto Star described Henry as \" one of the best players of his generation \" in 2010 . Henry \\'s former Arsenal manager , Wenger , described him as \" one of the greatest players [ he had ] ever seen \" in 2014 . In 2019 , The Independent ranked Henry in first place in their list of the \" 100 greatest Premier League players . \" Outside football Personal and family life Henry married English model Nicole Merry , real name Claire , on 5 July 2003 . The ceremony was held at Highclere Castle , and on 27 May 2005 the couple celebrated the birth of their first child , Téa . Henry dedicated his first goal following Téa \\'s birth to her by holding his fingers in a \" T \" shape and kissing them after scoring in a match against Newcastle United . When Henry was still at Arsenal , he also purchased a home in Hampstead , North London . However , shortly after his transfer to Barcelona , it was announced that Henry and his wife would divorce ; the decree nisi was granted in September 2007 . Their separation concluded in December 2008 when Henry paid Merry a divorce settlement close to her requested sum of £10 million . As a fan of the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) , Henry is often seen with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football . Henry stated in an interview that he admires basketball , as it is similar to football in pace and excitement . Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past , he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals ; and in the 2001 NBA Finals , he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson , whom he named as one of his favourite players . Appearance on screen Henry makes a short cameo appearance in the 2015 film Entourage . Henry \\'s part sees him walking a dog and having exchange with Ari Gold ( character played by Jeremy Piven ) , who is an over-the-top Hollywood agent . Henry makes a number of cameo appearances playing himself in the Apple TV+ football comedy series Ted Lasso . Social causes Henry is a member of the UNICEF-FIFA squad , where together with other professional footballers he appeared in a series of TV spots seen by hundreds of millions of fans around the world during the 2002 and 2006 FIFA World Cups . In these spots , the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children . Having been subjected to racism in the past , Henry is an active spokesperson against racism in football . The most prominent incident of racism against Henry was during a training session with the Spanish national team in 2004 , when a Spanish TV crew caught coach Luis Aragonés referring to Henry as \" black shit \" to José Antonio Reyes , Henry \\'s teammate at Arsenal . The incident caused an uproar in the British media , and there were calls for Aragonés to be sacked . Henry and Nike started the Stand Up Speak Up campaign against racism in football as a result of the incident . Subsequently , in 2007 , Time featured him as one of the \" Heroes & Pioneers \" on the Time 100 list of the most influential people in the world . Along with 45 other football players , Henry took part in FIFA \\'s \" Live for Love United \" in 2002 . The single was released in tandem with the 2002 FIFA World Cup and its proceeds went towards AIDS research . Henry also supports the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and Cystic Fibrosis Trust . Henry has also played in charity football games for various causes . In June 2018 , he reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star team which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt , with proceeds going to the Mecenet Cardiac Charity and the Children of the World fund . In a 3–2 win for France , Henry played a trademark no-look one-two pass with Zinedine Zidane before scoring with a 20-yard curling strike . Endorsements In 2006 , Henry was valued as the ninth-most commercially marketable footballer in the world , and throughout his career he has signed many endorsements and appeared in commercials . Sportswear At the beginning of his career , Henry signed with sportswear giant Nike . In the buildup to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan , Henry featured in Nike \\'s \" Secret Tournament \" advertisement , directed by Terry Gilliam , along with 24 superstar football players . In a 2004 advertisement , Henry pits his wits against others footballers in locations such as his bedroom and living room , which was partly inspired by Henry himself , who revealed that he always has a football nearby , even at home . In tandem with the 2006 FIFA World Cup , Henry also featured in Nike \\'s Joga Bonito campaign , Portuguese for \" beautiful game . \" Henry \\'s deal with Nike ended after the 2006 FIFA World Cup , when he signed a deal with Reebok to appear in their \" I Am What I Am \" campaign . As part of Reebok Entertainment \\'s \" Framed \" series , Henry was the star of a half-hour episode that detailed the making of a commercial about himself directed by Spanish actress Paz Vega . In 2011 , Henry switched to Puma boots . Other endorsements Henry featured in the Renault Clio advertisements in which he popularised the term va-va-voom , meaning \" life \" or \" passion . \" His romantic interest in the commercial was his then-girlfriend , later his wife ( now divorced ) , Claire Merry . \" Va-va-voom \" was subsequently added to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary . In February 2007 , Henry was named as one of the three global ambassadors of Gillette \\'s \" Champions Program , \" which purported to feature three of the \" best-known , most widely respected and successful athletes competing today \" and also showcased Roger Federer and Tiger Woods in a series of television commercials . In reaction to the handball controversy following the France vs Ireland 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier , Gillette faced a boycott and accusations of doctoring French versions of their Champions poster , but subsequently released a statement backing Henry . Henry was part of Pepsi \\'s \" Dare For More \" campaign in 2005 , alongside the likes of David Beckham and Ronaldinho . He starred in a 2014 advert for Beats headphones with other global football stars including Neymar and Luis Suárez , with the theme of \" The Game Before the Game \" and the players pre-game ritual of listening to music . Henry featured on the front cover of the editions of EA Sports \\' FIFA video game series from FIFA 2001 to FIFA 2005 . He was included as an icon to the Ultimate Team in FIFA 18 . He was also a cover star for the Konami Pro Evolution Soccer video game series , and was featured on the covers of Pro Evolution Soccer 4 to Pro Evolution Soccer 6 .

( GHD ) , or human growth hormone deficiency , is a medical condition resulting from not enough growth hormone ( GH ) . Generally the most noticeable symptom is that an individual attains a short height . Newborns may also present low blood sugar or a small penis size . In adults there may be decreased muscle mass , high cholesterol levels , or poor bone density . GHD can be present at birth or develop later in life . Causes may include genetics , trauma , infections , tumors , or radiation therapy . Genes that may be involved include GH1 , GHRHR , or BTK . In a third of cases no cause is apparent . The underlying mechanism generally involves problems with the pituitary gland . Some cases are associated with a lack of other pituitary hormones , in which case it is known as combined pituitary hormone deficiency . Diagnosis involves blood tests to measure growth hormone levels . Treatment is by growth hormone replacement using synthetic human growth hormone . The frequency of the condition is unclear . Most cases are initially noticed in children . The genetic forms of this disease are estimated to affect about 1 in 7,000 people . Most types occur equally in males and females though males are more often diagnosed . Signs and symptoms Child Severe prenatal deficiency of GH , as occurs in congenital hypopituitarism , has little effect on fetal growth . However , prenatal and congenital deficiency can reduce the size of a male \\'s penis , especially when gonadotropins are also deficient . Besides micropenis in males , additional consequences of severe deficiency in the first days of life can include hypoglycemia and exaggerated jaundice ( both direct and indirect hyperbilirubinemia ) . Even congenital GH deficiency does not usually impair length growth until after the first few months of life . From late in the first year until mid-teens , poor growth and/or shortness is the hallmark of childhood GH deficiency . Growth is not as severely affected in GH deficiency as in untreated hypothyroidism , but growth at about half the usual velocity for age is typical . It tends to be accompanied by delayed physical maturation so that bone maturation and puberty may be several years delayed . When severe GH deficiency is present from birth and never treated , adult heights can be as short as 48-65 inches ( 122–165 cm ) . Severe GH deficiency in early childhood also results in slower muscular development , so that gross motor milestones such as standing , walking , and jumping may be delayed . Body composition ( i.e. , the relative amounts of bone , muscle , and fat ) is affected in many children with severe deficiency , so that mild to moderate chubbiness is common ( though GH deficiency alone rarely causes severe obesity ) . Some severely GH-deficient children have recognizable , cherubic facial features characterized by maxillary hypoplasia and forehead prominence . Other side effects in children include sparse hair growth and frontal recession , and pili torti and trichorrhexis nodosa are also sometimes present . Adults Recognised effects include : Increased 5-alpha-reductase Reduced sex hormone-binding globulin ( SHBG ) Reduced muscle mass and strength Baldness in men Reduced bone mass and osteoporosis ( Decreased bone density ) Reduced energy Impaired concentration and memory loss Increased body fat , particularly around the waistline Lipid abnormalities , particularly raised LDL cholesterol Increased levels of fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor Cardiac dysfunction , including a thickened intima media Lack of well-being Depression and anxiety Social isolation Fibromyalgia syndrome Neuromuscular dysfunction Central adiposity Decreased muscle mass Insulin resistance Accelerated atherogenesis Prothrombotic state Decreased sweating and thermoregulation . Causes Growth hormone deficiency in childhood commonly has no identifiable cause ( idiopathic ) , and adult-onset GHD is commonly due to pituitary tumours and their treatment or to cranial irradiation . A more complete list of causes includes : mutations of specific genes ( e.g. , GHRHR , GH1 ) congenital diseases such as Prader-Willi syndrome , Turner syndrome , or short-stature homeobox gene deficiency congenital malformations involving the pituitary ( e.g. , septo-optic dysplasia , posterior pituitary ectopia ) chronic kidney disease intracranial tumors in or near the sella turcica , especially craniopharyngioma damage to the pituitary from radiation therapy to the head ( e.g . for leukemia or brain tumors ) , from surgery , from trauma , or from intracranial disease ( e.g . hydrocephalus ) autoimmune inflammation ( hypophysitis ) ischemic or hemorrhagic infarction from low blood pressure ( Sheehan syndrome ) or hemorrhage pituitary apoplexy There are a variety of rare diseases that resemble GH deficiency , including the childhood growth failure , facial appearance , delayed bone age , and low insulin-like growth factor-1 ( IGF-1 ) levels . However , GH testing elicits normal or high levels of GH in the blood , demonstrating that the problem is not due to a deficiency of GH but rather to a reduced sensitivity to its action . Insensitivity to GH is traditionally termed Laron dwarfism , but over the last 15 years many different types of GH resistance have been identified , primarily involving mutations of the GH binding protein or receptors . Familial isolated growth hormone deficiency ( IGHD ) can be inherited as an autosomal recessive ( type I ) , autosomal dominant ( type II ) , or X-linked ( type III ) characteristic . Pathophysiology As an adult ages , it is normal for the pituitary to produce diminishing amounts of GH and many other hormones , particularly the sex steroids . Physicians therefore distinguish between the natural reduction in GH levels which comes with age , and the much lower levels of \" true \" deficiency . Such deficiency almost always has an identifiable cause , with adult-onset GHD without a definable cause ( \" idiopathic GH deficiency \" ) extremely rare . GH does function in adulthood to maintain muscle and bone mass and strength , and has poorly understood effects on cognition and mood . Diagnosis Although GH can be readily measured in a blood sample , testing for GH deficiency is constrained by the fact that levels are nearly undetectable for most of the day . This makes simple measurement of GH in a single blood sample useless for detecting deficiency . Physicians therefore use a combination of indirect and direct criteria in assessing GHD , including : Auxologic criteria ( defined by body measurements ) Indirect hormonal criteria ( IGF levels from a single blood sample ) Direct hormonal criteria ( measurement of GH in multiple blood samples to determine secretory patterns or responses to provocative testing ) , in particular : Subnormal frequency and amplitude of GH secretory peaks when sampled over several hours Subnormal GH secretion in response to at least two provocative stimuli Increased IGF1 levels after a few days of GH treatment Response to GH treatment Corroborative evidence of pituitary dysfunction \" Provocative tests \" involve giving a dose of an agent that will normally provoke a pituitary to release a burst of growth hormone . An intravenous line is established , the agent is given , and small amounts of blood are drawn at 15-minute intervals over the next hour to determine if a rise of GH was provoked . Agents which have been used clinically to stimulate and assess GH secretion are arginine , levodopa , clonidine , epinephrine and propranolol , glucagon and insulin . An insulin tolerance test has been shown to be reproducible , age-independent , and able to distinguish between GHD and normal adults , and so is the test of choice . Severe GH deficiency in childhood additionally has the following measurable characteristics : Proportional stature well below that expected for family heights , although this characteristic may not be present in the case of familial-linked GH deficiency Below-normal velocity of growth Delayed physical maturation Delayed bone age Low levels of IGF1 , IGF2 , IGF binding protein 3 Increased growth velocity after a few months of GH treatment In childhood and adulthood , the diagnosing doctor will look for these features accompanied by corroboratory evidence of hypopituitarism such as deficiency of other pituitary hormones , a structurally abnormal pituitary , or a history of damage to the pituitary . This would confirm the diagnosis ; in the absence of pituitary pathology , further testing would be required . Classification Growth hormone deficiency can be congenital or acquired in childhood or adult life . It can be partial or complete . It is usually permanent , but sometimes transient . It may be an isolated deficiency or occur in association with deficiencies of other pituitary hormones . The term hypopituitarism is often used interchangeably with GH deficiency but more often denotes GH deficiency plus deficiency of at least one other anterior pituitary hormone . When GH deficiency ( usually with other anterior pituitary deficiencies ) is associated with posterior pituitary hormone deficiency ( usually diabetes insipidus ) , the condition is termed panhypopituitarism . Treatment GH deficiency is treated by replacing GH with daily injections under the skin or into muscle . Until 1985 , growth hormone for treatment was obtained by extraction from human pituitary glands collected at autopsy . Since 1985 , recombinant human growth hormone ( rHGH ) is a recombinant form of human GH produced by genetically engineered bacteria , manufactured by recombinant DNA technology . In both children and adults , costs of treatment in terms of money , effort , and the impact on day-to-day life , are substantial . Child GH treatment is not recommended for children who are not growing despite having normal levels of growth hormone , and in the UK it is not licensed for this use . Children requiring treatment usually receive daily injections of growth hormone . Most pediatric endocrinologists monitor growth and adjust dose every 3–6 months and many of these visits involve blood tests and x-rays . Treatment is usually extended as long as the child is growing , and lifelong continuation may be recommended for those most severely deficient . Nearly painless insulin syringes , pen injectors , or a needle-free delivery system reduce the discomfort . Injection sites include the biceps , thigh , buttocks , and stomach . Injection sites should be rotated daily to avoid lipoatrophy . Treatment is expensive , costing as much as US $ 10,000 to $ 40,000 a year in the US . Adults GH supplementation is not recommended medically for the physiologic age-related decline in GH/IGF secretion . It may be appropriate in diagnosed adult-onset deficiency , where a weekly dose of approximately 25 % of that given to children is given . Lower doses again are called for in the elderly to reduce the incidence of side effects and maintain age-dependent normal levels of IGF-1 . In many countries , including the UK , the majority view among endocrinologists is that the failure of treatment to provide any demonstrable , measurable benefits in terms of outcomes means treatment is not recommended for all adults with severe GHD , and national guidelines in the UK as set out by NICE suggest three criteria which all need to be met for treatment to be indicated : Severe GH deficiency , defined as a peak GH response of < 9mU/litre during an insulin tolerance test Perceived impairment of quality of life , as assessed by questionnaire They are already treated for other pituitary hormone disorders Where treatment is indicated , duration is dependent upon indication . Cost of adult treatment in the UK is 3000-4000 GBP annually . Side effects Headaches Joint pain and muscle pain Fluid retention , and carpal tunnel syndrome Mild hypertension Visual problems Nausea and vomiting Paraesthesiae Antibody formation Reactions at the injection site Rarely , benign intracranial hypertension . Prognosis Child When treated with GH , a severely deficient child will begin to grow faster within months . In the first year of treatment , the rate of growth may increase from half as fast as other children are growing to twice as fast ( e.g. , from 1 inch a year to 4 inches , or 2.5 cm to 10 ) . Growth typically slows in subsequent years , but usually remains above normal so that over several years a child who had fallen far behind in his height may grow into the normal height range . Excess adipose tissue may be reduced . Adults GH treatment can confer a number of measurable benefits to severely GH-deficient adults , such as enhanced energy and strength , and improved bone density . Muscle mass may increase at the expense of adipose tissue . Although adults with hypopituitarism have been shown to have a reduced life expectancy , and a cardiovascular mortality rate of more than double controls , treatment has not been shown to improve mortality , although blood lipid levels do improve . Similarly , although measurements of bone density improve with treatment , rates of fractures have not been shown to improve . Effects on quality of life are unproven , with a number of studies finding that adults with GHD had near-normal indicators of QoL at baseline ( giving little scope for improvement ) , and many using outdated dosing strategies . However , it may be that those adults with poor QoL at the start of treatment do benefit . Epidemiology The incidence of idiopathic GHD in infants is about 1 in every 3800 live births , and rates in older children are rising as more children survive childhood cancers which are treated with radiotherapy , although exact rates are hard to obtain . The incidence of genuine adult-onset GHD , normally due to pituitary tumours , is estimated at 10 per million . History Like many other 19th century medical terms which lost precise meaning as they gained wider currency , \" midget \" as a term for someone with severe proportional shortness acquired pejorative connotations and is no longer used in a medical context . Notable modern pop cultural figures with growth hormone deficiency include actor and comedian Andy Milonakis , who has the appearance and voice of an adolescent boy despite being an adult . Argentine footballer Lionel Messi was diagnosed at age 10 with growth hormone deficiency and was subsequently treated .

Midfielders are generally positioned on the field between their team \\'s defenders and forwards . Some midfielders play a strictly-defined defensive role , breaking up attacks , and are otherwise known as defensive midfielders . Others blur the boundaries , being more mobile and efficient in passing : they are commonly referred to as deep-lying midfielders , play-makers , box-to-box , or holding midfielders . The number of midfielders on a team and their assigned roles depends on the team \\'s formation ; the collective group of these players on the field is sometimes referred to as the midfield . Most managers assign at least one midfielder to disrupt the opposing team \\'s attacks , while others may be tasked with creating goals , or have equal responsibilities between attack and defence . Midfielders are the players who typically travel the greatest distance during a match . Midfielders arguably have the most possession during a game , and thus they are among the fittest players on the pitch . Central midfielder Central or centre midfielders are players whose role is divided roughly equally between attack and defence and to dominate the play around the centre of the pitch . These players will try to pass the ball to the team \\'s attacking midfielders and forwards and may also help their team \\'s attacks by making runs into the opposition \\'s penalty area and attempting shots on goal themselves . When the opposing team has the ball , a central midfielder may drop back to protect the goal or move forward and press the opposition ball-carrier to recover the ball . A centre midfielder defending their goal will move in front of their centre-backs in order to block long shots by the opposition and possibly track opposition midfielders making runs towards the goal . The 4–3–3 and 4–5–1 formations each use three central midfielders . The 4−4−2 formation may use two central midfielders , and in the 4–2–3–1 formation one of the two deeper midfielders may be a central midfielder . Box-to-box midfielder The term box-to-box midfielder refers to central midfielders who are hard-working and who have good all-round abilities , which makes them skilled at both defending and attacking . These players can therefore track back to their own box to make tackles and block shots and also carry the ball forward or run to the opponents \\' box to try to score . Beginning in the mid-2000s , the change of trends and the decline of the standard 4–4–2 formation ( in many cases making way for the 4–2–3–1 and 4–3–3 formations ) imposed restrictions on the typical box-to-box midfielders of the 1980s and 1990s , as teams \\' two midfield roles were now often divided into \" holders \" or \" creators \" , with a third variation upon the role being described as that of a \" carrier \" or \" surger \" . Some notable examples of box-to-box midfielders are Lothar Matthäus , Clarence Seedorf , Bastian Schweinsteiger , Steven Gerrard , Johan Neeskens , Sócrates , Yaya Touré , Patrick Vieira , Frank Lampard and Roy Keane . Mezzala In Italian football , the term mezzala ( literally \" half-winger \" in Italian ) is used to describe the position of the one or two central midfielders who play on either side of a holding midfielder and/or playmaker . The term was initially applied to the role of an inside forward in the WM and Metodo formations in Italian , but later described a specific type of central midfielder . The mezzala is often a quick and hard-working attack-minded midfielder , with good skills and noted offensive capabilities , as well as a tendency to make overlapping attacking runs , but also a player who participates in the defensive aspect of the game , and who can give width to a team by drifting out wide ; as such , the term can be applied to several different roles . In English , the term has come to be seen as a variant of the box-to-box midfielder role . Wide midfielder Left and right midfielders have a role balanced between attack and defence whilst they play a lot of crosses in the box for forwards.They are positioned closer to the touchlines of the pitch . They may be asked to cross the ball into the opponents \\' penalty area to make scoring chances for their teammates , and when defending they may put pressure on opponents who are trying to cross . Common modern formations that include left and right midfielders are the 4−4−2 , the 4−4−1−1 , the 4–2–3–1 and the 4−5−1 formations . Jonathan Wilson describes the development of the 4−4−2 formation : \" …the winger became a wide midfielder , a shuttler , somebody who might be expected to cross a ball but was also meant to put in a defensive shift . \" Two notable examples of wide midfielders are David Beckham and Ryan Giggs . In Italian football , the role of the wide midfielder is known as tornante di centrocampo or simply tornante ( \" returning \" ) ; it originated from the role of an outside forward , and came to be known as such as it often required players in this position to track back and assist the back-line with defensive duties , in addition to aiding the midfield and attacking . Wing-half The historic position of wing-half ( not to be confused with mezzala ) was given to midfielders ( half-backs ) who played near the side of the pitch . It became obsolete as wide players with defensive duties have tended to become more a part of the defence as full-backs . Defensive midfielder Defensive midfielders are midfield players who focus on protecting their team \\'s goal . These players may defend a zone in front of their team \\'s defence , or man mark specific opposition attackers . Defensive midfielders may also move to the full-back or centre-back positions if those players move forward to join in an attack . Sergio Busquets described his attitude : \" The coach knows that I am an obedient player who likes to help out and if I have to run to the wing to cover someone \\'s position , great . \" A good defensive midfielder needs good positional awareness , anticipation of opponent \\'s play , marking , tackling , interceptions , passing and great stamina and strength ( for their tackling ) . In South American football , this role is known as a volante de marca ( \" steering wheel , \" in Spanish ) , while in Mexico it is known as volante de contención . In Portugal , it is instead known as trinco . Holding midfielder A holding or deep-lying midfielder stays close to their team \\'s defence , while other midfielders may move forward to attack . The holding midfielder may also have responsibilities when their team has the ball . This player will make mostly short and simple passes to more attacking members of their team but may try some more difficult passes depending on the team \\'s strategy . Marcelo Bielsa is considered as a pioneer for the use of a holding midfielder in defence . This position may be seen in the 4–2–3–1 and 4–4–2 diamond formations . Initially , a defensive midfielder , or \" destroyer \" , and a playmaker , or \" creator \" , were often fielded alongside each other as a team \\'s two holding central midfielders . The destroyer was usually responsible for making tackles , regaining possession , and distributing the ball to the creator , while the creator was responsible for retaining possession and keeping the ball moving , often with long passes out to the flanks , in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or regista ( see below ) . Early examples of a destroyer are Nobby Stiles , Herbert Wimmer , Marco Tardelli , while later examples include Claude Makélélé and Javier Mascherano , although several of these players also possessed qualities of other types of midfielders , and were therefore not confined to a single role . Early examples of a creator would be Gérson , Glenn Hoddle , and Sunday Oliseh , while more recent examples are Xabi Alonso and Michael Carrick . The latest and third type of holding midfielder developed as a box-to-box midfielder , or \" carrier \" or \" surger \" , neither entirely destructive nor creative , who is capable of winning back possession and subsequently advancing from deeper positions either by distributing the ball to a teammate and making late runs into the box , or by carrying the ball him or herself ; recent examples of this type of player are Clarence Seedorf and Bastian Schweinsteiger , while Sami Khedira and Fernandinho are destroyers with carrying tendencies , Luka Modrić is a carrier with several qualities of the regista , and Yaya Touré was a carrier who became a playmaker , in later part of his career , after losing his stamina . Deep-lying playmaker A deep-lying playmaker is a holding midfielder who specializes in ball skills such as passing , rather than defensive skills like tackling . When this player has the ball , they may attempt longer or more complex passes than other holding players . They may try to set the tempo of their team \\'s play , retain possession , or build plays through short exchanges , or they may try to pass the ball long to a centre forward or winger , or even pass short to a teammate in the hole , the area between the opponents \\' defenders and midfielders . In Italy , the deep-lying playmaker is known as a regista , whereas in Brazil , it is known as a \" meia-armador \" . In Italy , the role of the regista developed from the centre half-back or centromediano metodista position in Vittorio Pozzo \\'s metodo system ( a precursor of the central or holding midfield position in the 2–3–2–3 formation ) , as the metodista \\'s responsibilities were not entirely defensive but also creative ; as such , the metodista was not solely tasked with breaking down possession , but also with starting attacking plays after winning back the ball . Writer Jonathan Wilson instead described Xabi Alonso \\'s holding midfield role as that of a \" creator \" , a player who was responsible for retaining possession in the manner of a more old-fashioned deep-lying playmaker or regista , noting that : \" although capable of making tackles , [ Alonso ] focused on keeping the ball moving , occasionally raking long passes out to the flanks to change the angle of attack . \" Centre-half The historic central half-back position gradually retreated from the midfield line to provide increased protection to the back–line against centre-forwards – that dedicated defensive role in the centre is still commonly referred to as a \" centre-half \" as a legacy of its origins . In Italian football jargon , this position was known as the centromediano metodista or metodista , although this term was later also applied to describe players who operated in a central holding-midfielder role , but who also had creative responsibilities in addition to defensive duties . Attacking midfielder An \\'attacking midfielder \\' is a midfield player who is positioned in an advanced midfield position , usually between central midfield and the team \\'s forwards , and who has a primarily offensive role . Some attacking midfielders are called trequartista or fantasista ( , i.e . a creative playmaker between the forwards and the midfield ) , who are usually mobile , creative and highly skilful players , known for their deft touch , technical ability , dribbling skills , vision , ability to shoot from long range , and passing prowess . However , not all attacking midfielders are trequartistas – some attacking midfielders are very vertical and are essentially auxiliary attackers who serve to link-up play , hold up the ball , or provide the final pass , i.e . secondary strikers . According to positioning along the field , attacking midfield may be divided into left , right and central attacking midfield roles but most importantly they are a striker behind the forwards . A central attacking midfielder may be referred to as a playmaker , or number ten ( due to the association of the number 10 shirt with this position ) . Advanced playmaker These players typically serve as the offensive pivot of the team , and are sometimes said to be \" playing in the hole \" , although this term can also be used as deep-lying forward . The attacking midfielder is an important position that requires the player to possess superior technical abilities in terms of passing and dribbling , as well as , perhaps more importantly , the ability to read the opposing defence in order to deliver defence-splitting passes to the striker . This specialist midfielder \\'s main role is to create good shooting and goal-scoring opportunities using superior vision , control , and technical skill , by making crosses , through balls , and headed knockdowns to teammates . They may try to set up shooting opportunities for themselves by dribbling or performing a give-and-go with a teammate . Attacking midfielders may also make runs into the opponents \\' penalty area in order to shoot from another teammate \\'s pass . Advanced playmaker , is regularly utilized , he or she is commonly the team \\'s star player , and often wears the number 10 shirt . As such , a team is often constructed so as to allow their attacking midfielder to roam free and create as the situation demands . One such popular formation is the 4–4–2 \" diamond \" ( or 4–1–2–1–2 ) , in which defined attacking and defensive midfielders replace the more traditional pair of central midfielders . Known as the \" fantasista \" or \" trequartista \" in Italy , in Spain , the offensive playmaker is known as the \" Mediapunta , in Brazil , the offensive playmaker is known as the \" meia atacante , \" whereas in Argentina and Uruguay , it is known as the \" enganche . \" There are also some examples of more flexible advanced playmakers , such as Zinedine Zidane , Andrés Iniesta , Juan Riquelme , Nécib , and David Silva . These players could control the tempo of the game in deeper areas of the pitch while also being able to push forward and play line-breaking through balls . Mesut Özil can be considered as a classic 10 who adopted a slightly more direct approach and specialised in playing the final ball . False attacking midfielder The false attacking midfielder description has been used in Italian football to describe a player who is seemingly playing as an attacking midfielder in a 4–3–1–2 formation , but who eventually drops deeper into midfield , drawing opposing players out of position and creating space to be exploited by teammates making attacking runs ; the false-attacking midfielder will eventually sit in a central midfield role and function as a deep-lying playmaker . The false-attacking midfielder is therefore usually a creative and tactically intelligent player with good vision , technique , movement , passing ability , and striking ability from distance . He or she should also be a hard-working player , who is able to read the game and help the team defensively . \" False 10 \" or \" central winger \" The \" false 10 \" or \" central winger \" is a type of midfielder , which differs from the false-attacking midfielder . Much like the \" false 9 , \" their specificity lies in the fact that , although they seemingly play as an attacking midfielder on paper , unlike a traditional playmaker who stays behind the striker in the centre of the pitch , the false 10 \\'s goal is to move out of position and drift wide when in possession of the ball to help both the wingers and fullbacks to overload the flanks . This means two problems for the opposing midfielders : either they let the false 10 drift wide , and their presence , along with both the winger and the fullback , creates a three-on-two player advantage out wide ; or they follow the false 10 , but leave space in the centre of the pitch for wingers or onrushing midfielders to exploit . False 10s are usually traditional wingers who are told to play in the centre of the pitch , and their natural way of playing makes them drift wide and look to provide deliveries into the box for teammates . On occasion , the false-10 can also function in a different manner alongside a false-9 , usually in a 4–6–0 formation , disguised as either a 4–3–3 or 4–2–3–1 formation . When other forwards or false-9s drop deep and draw defenders away from the false-10s , creating space in the middle of the pitch , the false-10 will then also surprise defenders by exploiting this space and moving out of position once again , often undertaking offensive dribbling runs forward towards goal , or running on to passes from false-9s , which in turn enables them to create goalscoring opportunities or go for goal themselves . Winger In modern football , the terms winger or wide player refer to a non-defender who plays on the left or right sides of the pitch . These terms can apply to left or right midfielders , left or right attacking midfielders , or left or right forwards . Left or right-sided defenders such as wing-backs or full-backs are generally not called wingers . In the 2−3−5 formation popular in the late 19th century wingers remained mostly near the touchlines of the pitch , and were expected to cross the ball for the team \\'s inside and centre forwards . Traditionally , wingers were purely attacking players and were not expected to track back and defend . This began to change in the 1960s . In the 1966 World Cup , England manager Alf Ramsey did not select wingers from the quarter-final onwards . This team was known as the \" Wingless Wonders \" and led to the modern 4–4–2 formation . This has led to most modern wide players having a more demanding role in the sense that they are expected to provide defensive cover for their full-backs and track back to repossess the ball , as well as provide skillful crosses for centre forwards and strikers . Some forwards are able to operate as wingers behind a lone striker . In a three-man midfield , specialist wingers are sometimes deployed down the flanks alongside the central midfielder or playmaker . Even more demanding is the role of wing-back , where the wide player is expected to provide both defence and attack . As the role of winger can be classed as a forward or a midfielder , this role instead blurs the divide between defender and midfielder . Italian manager Antonio Conte has been known to use wide midfielders or wingers who act as wing-backs in his trademark 3–5–2 and 3–4–3 formations , for example ; these players are expected both to push up and provide width in attack as well as track back and assist their team defensively . On occasion , the role of a winger can also be occupied by a different type of player . For example , certain managers have been known to use a \" wide target man \" on the wing , namely a large and physical player who usually plays as a centre-forward , and who will attempt to win aerial challenges and hold up the ball on the flank , or drag full-backs out of position ; Romelu Lukaku , for example , has been used in this role on occasion . Another example is Mario Mandžukić under manager Massimiliano Allegri at Juventus during the 2016–17 season ; normally a striker , he was instead used on the left flank , and was required to win aerial duels , hold up the ball , and create space , as well as being tasked with pressing opposing players . Today , a winger is usually an attacking midfielder who is stationed in a wide position near the touchlines . Wingers such as Stanley Matthews or Jimmy Johnstone used to be classified as outside forwards in traditional W-shaped formations , and were formally known as \" Outside Right \" or \" Outside Left , \" but as tactics evolved through the last 40 years , wingers have dropped to deeper field positions and are now usually classified as part of the midfield , usually in 4–4–2 or 4–5–1 formations ( but while the team is on the attack , they tend to resemble 4–2–4/2–4–4 and 4–3–3 formations respectively ) . The responsibilities of the winger include : Providing a \" wide presence \" as a passing option on the flank . To beat the opposing full-back either with skill or with speed . To read passes from the midfield that give them a clear crossing opportunity , when going wide , or that give them a clear scoring opportunity , when cutting inside towards goal . To double up on the opposition winger , particularly when he or she is being \" double-marked \" by both the team \\'s full back and winger . The prototypical winger is fast , tricky and enjoys \\'hugging \\' the touchline , that is , running downfield close to the touchline and delivering crosses . However , players with different attributes can thrive on the wing as well . Some wingers prefer to cut infield ( as opposed to staying wide ) and pose a threat as playmakers by playing diagonal passes to forwards or taking a shot at goal . Even players who are not considered quick , have been successfully fielded as wingers at club and international level for their ability to create play from the flank . Occasionally wingers are given a free role to roam across the front line and are relieved of defensive responsibilities . The typical abilities of wingers include : Technical skill to beat a full-back in a one-to-one situation . Pace , to beat the full-back one-on-one . Crossing ability when out wide . Good off-the-ball ability when reading a pass from the midfield or from fellow attackers . Good passing ability and composure , to retain possession while in opposition territory . The modern winger should also be comfortable on either wing so as to adapt to quick tactical changes required by the coach . Although wingers are a familiar part of football , the use of wingers is by no means universal . There are many successful football teams who operate without wingers . A famous example is Carlo Ancelotti \\'s late 2000s Milan , who typically play in a narrow midfield diamond formation or in a Christmas tree formation ( 4–3–2–1 ) , relying on full-backs to provide the necessary width down the wings . Inverted winger An inverted winger is a modern tactical development of the traditional winger position . Most wingers are assigned to either side of the field based on their footedness , with right-footed players on the right and left-footed players on the left . This assumes that assigning a player to their natural side ensures a more powerful cross as well as greater ball-protection along the touch-lines . However , when the position is inverted and a winger instead plays inside-out on the opposite flank ( i.e. , a right-footed player as a left inverted winger ) , they effectively become supporting strikers and primarily assume a role in the attack . As opposed to traditionally pulling the opponent \\'s full-back out and down the flanks before crossing the ball in near the by-line , positioning a winger on the opposite side of the field allows the player to cut-in around the 18-yard box , either threading passes between defenders or shooting on goal using the dominant foot . This offensive tactic has found popularity in the modern game due to the fact that it gives traditional wingers increased mobility as playmakers and goalscorers , such as the left-footed right winger Domenico Berardi of Sassuolo who achieved 30 career goals faster than any player in the past half-century of Serie A football . Not only are inverted wingers able to push full-backs onto their weak sides , but they are also able to spread and force the other team to defend deeper as forwards and wing-backs route towards the goal , ultimately creating more scoring opportunities . Other midfielders within this tactical archetype include Lionel Messi and Eden Hazard , as well as Megan Rapinoe of the USWNT . Clubs such as Real Madrid often choose to play their wingers on the \" wrong \" flank for this reason ; former Real Madrid coach José Mourinho often played Ángel Di María on the right and Cristiano Ronaldo on the left . Former Bayern Munich manager Jupp Heynckes often played the left-footed Arjen Robben on the right and the right-footed Franck Ribéry on the left . One of the foremost practitioners of playing from either flank was German winger Jürgen Grabowski , whose flexibility helped Germany to third place in the 1970 World Cup , and the world title in 1974 . A description that has been used in the media to label a variation upon the inverted winger position is that of an \" attacking , \" \" false , \" or \" goalscoring winger , \" as exemplified by Cristiano Ronaldo \\'s role on the left flank during his time at Real Madrid in particular . This label has been used to describe an offensive–minded inverted winger , who will seemingly operate out wide on paper , but who instead will be given the freedom to make unmarked runs into more advanced central areas inside the penalty area , in order to get on the end of passes and crosses and score goals , effectively functioning as a striker . This role is somewhat comparable to what is known as the raumdeuter role in German football jargon ( literally \" space interpreter \" ) , as exemplified by Thomas Müller , namely an attacking–minded wide player , who will move into central areas in order to find spaces from which he can receive passes and score or assist goals , even though he is n\\'t very sharp at dribbling and lacks pace to run past defenders at speed . False winger The \" false winger \" or \" seven–and–a–half \" is a label which has been used to describe a type of player who normally plays centrally , but who instead is deployed out wide on paper ; during the course of a match , however , they will move inside and operate in the centre of the pitch , in order to drag defenders out of position , congest the midfield and give their team a numerical advantage in this area , so that they can dominate possession in the middle of the pitch and create chances for the forwards ; this position also leaves space for full-backs to make overlapping attacking runs up the flank . Samir Nasri , who has been deployed in this role , once described it as that of a \" non-axial playmaker . \" See also Association football positions References External links Association football positions Association football terminology Association football player non-biographical articles', '\" Bella ciao \" ( ; \" Goodbye beautiful \" ) is an Italian protest folk song from the late 19th century , originally sung by the mondina workers in protest against the harsh working conditions in the paddy fields of northern Italy . The text as sung today was first published in 1953 in the magazine La Lapa , and then in L\\'Unità in 1957 . It only achieved widespread popularity after the Spoleto Festival of 1964 . Today , it is associated with Italian resistance movement , despite no conclusive evidence that it was sung during World War II . It has achieved worldwide popularity as an anthem about resistance and freedom . History The origins of the song are unclear . One hypothesis is that \" Bella Ciao \" was originally sung as \" Alla mattina appena alzata \" by seasonal workers of paddy fields of rice , especially in Italy \\'s Po Valley from the late 19th century to the first half of the 20th century with different lyrics . They worked at monda ( weeding ) the rice fields in northern Italy , to help the healthy growth of young rice plants . It took place during the flooding of the fields , from the end of April to the beginning of June every year , during which the delicate shoots needed to be protected , during the first stages of their development , from temperature differences between the day and the night . It consisted of two phases : transplanting the plants and pruning the weeds . Monda was an extremely tiring task , carried out mostly by women known as mondinas , from the poorest social classes . They would spend their workdays with their bare feet in water up to their knees , and their back bent for many hours . The atrocious working conditions , long hours and very low pay led to constant dissatisfaction and , at times , to rebellious movements and riots in the early years of the 20th century . The struggles against the supervising padroni was even harder , with plenty of clandestine workers ready to compromise even further the already low wages just to get work . Besides \" Bella ciao \" , similar songs by the mondina women included \" \" and \" \" . Other similar versions of the antecedents of \" Bella ciao \" appeared over the years , indicating that \" Alla mattina appena alzata \" must have been composed in the latter half of the 19th century . The earliest written version is dated 1906 and comes from near Vercelli , Piedmont . Despite its modern association with the Italian resistance movement ( 1943-1945 ) , there is little evidence it was sung or existed in its current form at the time . The song is not present in any of the collection of resistance and partisan songs collected by historians . Music historians Antonio Virgilio Savona and Michele Straniero claim that the song was not sung until after the war . Noted Italian partisans and firsthand witnesses like Gianpaolo Pansa and Giorgio Bocca have claimed that indeed the song was not sung by the partisans during the Italian resistance . Italian journalist Luigi Morrone traces the popularity of the song to the music Festival of Spoleto in 1964 . Here , the song is sung by Giovanna Daffini , who claimed it to be an old song of the mondine that was then adapted by the partisans during the war , although this reconstruction has not been supported by the evidence . She had previously presented the mondina version in 1962 . The text as sung today was first published in 1953 in the magazine La Lapa , and then in L\\'Unità in 1957 . It only achieved widespread popularity after the Festival dei Due Mondi of 1964 . Melody Italian folksinger Giovanna Daffini recorded the song in 1962 . The music is in quadruple meter . Lyrics Mondine version Partisan version Covers One of the most famous recordings is that of the Italian folk singer Giovanna Daffini who recorded both the mondina and the partisan versions .

Livorno and also outside of Italy by A.E.K. , Portland Timbers , Atlanta United FC , Motherwell , Aris Thessaloniki , Panathinaikos F.C . and FC Zürich fans . In April 2018 , supporters from the Portuguese soccer club F.C . Porto adapted the song with the lyrics \" Penta Xau \" ( \" Bye bye fifth \" ) , referring to the lost opportunity by rival club S.L . Benfica to win a fifth national championship in a row , a feat only F.C . Porto has achieved in the country . The song was also adapted by Brazilian fans during World Cup 2018 to tease and taunt Argentina about their possible exit in the first round , which eventually did not occur , with references to Argentine players Di María , Mascherano , and Messi ( Brazil and Argentina have a well-known football rivalry ) . The song was the inspiration for the # EleNão movement against extreme right wing Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro . During nationwide protests in Colombia in 2019 , the anti-fascist song was adapted by demonstrators to oppose the government of Iván Duque of the Centro Democrático party , who have been for years questioned or investigated for systematic violations of the Constitution , the environment , Human Rights and Crimes against humanity . As the presidential period of Duque ends in 2022 , since 2019 the song , dubbed as \\'Duque Chao \\' , is sung and interpreted in protests in Colombia and by the diáspora , also during the national strike demonstrations of April and May 2021 , in which citizens have been killed , injured and disappeared by state police forces . In March 2020 , the song once again gained international attention after Europeans and Italians in lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and Europe sang \" Bella ciao \" from the balconies of their housing complexes . Also North Macedonian singers Aleksandar and Dac in 2020 created a Macedonian language version of the song titled Корона чао ( Korona čao ) .

Averaging over a goal a game with West Germany , Müller was , as of 11 July 2021 , 21st on the list of all time international goalscorers , despite playing fewer matches than every other player in the top 48 . Among the top scorers , he has the third-highest goal-to-game ratio . He also had the highest ratio of 0.97 goals per game in the European Cup , scoring 34 goals in 35 matches . Nicknamed \" Bomber der Nation \" ( \" the nation \\'s Bomber \" ) or simply \" Der Bomber \" , Müller was named European Footballer of the Year in 1970 . After a successful season at Bayern Munich , he scored ten goals at the 1970 FIFA World Cup for West Germany where he received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer . In 1972 , he won the UEFA European Championship and was the top goalscorer , scoring two goals in the final . Two years later , he scored four goals in the 1974 World Cup , including the winning goal in the final . Müller held the all-time goal-scoring record in the World Cup with 14 goals for 32 years . In 1999 , Müller was ranked ninth in the European player of the Century election held by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics ( IFFHS ) , and he was voted 13th in the IFFHS \\' World Player of the Century election . In 2004 , Pelé named Müller in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . Club career Bayern Munich Born in Nördlingen , Germany , Müller began his football career at his hometown club TSV 1861 Nördlingen . Müller joined Bayern Munich in 1964 , where he teamed up with future stars Franz Beckenbauer and Sepp Maier . The club , which would go on to become the most successful German club in history , was then still in the Regionalliga Süd ( Regional League South ) , which was one level below the Bundesliga at the time . After one season , Bayern Munich advanced to the Bundesliga and started a long string of successes . With his club , Müller amassed titles during the 1960s and 1970s : he won the German Championship four times , the DFB-Pokal four times , the European Champions \\' Cup three consecutive years ( the first West German team to win it ; Müller scored in the 1974 final replay and the 1975 final ) , the Intercontinental Cup once , and the European Cup Winners \\' Cup once . An opportunistic goal-scorer , Müller also became German top scorer seven times and European top scorer twice . Müller scored 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches for Bayern Munich , 62 goals over the second-most successful Bundesliga scorer , Robert Lewandowski . He held the single-season Bundesliga record with 40 goals in season 1971–72 , a record that would be held until Lewandowski scored 41 goals during the 2020–21 season . Müller averaged a goal per game or better in seven of his 14 seasons . He scored 68 goals in 62 German international games . He held the record for most goals scored in a calendar year , striking 85 goals in 1972 , until his total was surpassed 40 years later in 2012 by Lionel Messi . Fort Lauderdale Strikers After his career in the Bundesliga Müller went to the United States , where he joined the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) in 1979 . He played three seasons with this team , scoring 40 goals , and reaching , but losing , the league final in 1980 . International career Müller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany . He was Germany \\'s all-time leading scorer for almost 40 years until surpassed by Miroslav Klose in 2014 , though Klose required over double the number of caps to do so , scoring his 69th goal in his 132nd appearance . Müller \\'s international career started in 1966 and ended on 7 July 1974 with victory at the 1974 World Cup at his home stadium in Munich . He scored the winning goal for the 2–1 victory over Johan Cruyff \\'s Netherlands in the final . His four goals in that tournament and his ten goals at the 1970 World Cup combined made him the all-time highest World Cup goalscorer at the time with 14 goals . His record stood until the 2006 tournament , coincidentally held in Germany , when it was broken by Brazilian striker Ronaldo , who also required more matches than Müller to achieve his tally . Müller also participated in the 1972 European Championship , becoming top scorer with four goals ( including two in the final ) and winning the Championship with the West German team . Müller quit playing for West Germany after the 1974 World Cup triumph following an argument with the German Football Association at the post-tournament celebration , when officials \\' wives were allowed to attend but players \\' wives were not . Life after football After Müller ended his career in 1982 , he fell into a slump and suffered from alcoholism . However , his former companions at Bayern Munich convinced him to go through alcohol rehabilitation . When he emerged , they gave him a job as a coach at Bayern Munich II . There is also a collection of apparel released by sporting giants Adidas under the Gerd Müller name . It is part of the Adidas originals series . In July 2008 , the Rieser Sportpark , in Nördlingen , where Müller had begun his career , was renamed the Gerd-Müller-Stadion in his honour . On 6 October 2015 , it was announced that Müller was suffering from Alzheimer \\'s disease . He died on 15 August 2021 in a nursing home in Wolfratshausen , aged 75 . Style of play In his book , Brilliant Orange : The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football , author David Winner writes , \" Müller was short , squat , awkward-looking and not notably fast ; he never fitted the conventional idea of a great footballer , but he had lethal acceleration over short distances , a remarkable aerial game , and uncanny goalscoring instincts . His short legs gave him a low center of gravity , so he could turn quickly and with perfect balance in spaces and at speeds that would cause other players to fall over . He also had a knack of scoring in unlikely situations . \" Müller used extreme acceleration and deceptive changes of pace to get to loose balls first , and bypass defenders . His teammate Franz Beckenbauer has emphasized Müller \\'s unusual speed : \" His pace was incredible . In training I have played against him and I never had a chance . \" Career statistics Club A goals tally in bold indicates that Müller was the competition \\'s top scorer for that season . International Müller scored 68 goals in 62 games for West Germany . His 14 goals in FIFA World Cup tournaments were a record between 1974 and 2006 . This score was bettered in 2006 by Brazil \\'s Ronaldo , and eight years later by German Miroslav Klose , who also broke Müller \\'s record for goals for Germany . However , Müller managed to score eight hat-tricks in his international career .

It is awarded when an offence punishable by a direct free kick is committed by a player in their own penalty area . The shot is taken from the penalty mark , which is from the goal line and centred between the touch lines . Procedure The ball is placed on the penalty mark , regardless of where in the penalty area the foul occurred . The player taking the kick must be identified to the referee . Only the kicker and the defending team \\'s goalkeeper are allowed to be within the penalty area ; all other players must be within the field of play , outside the penalty area , behind the penalty mark , and a minimum of 9.15m ( 10 yd ) from the penalty mark ( this distance is denoted by the penalty arc ) . The goalkeeper is allowed to move before the ball is kicked , but must remain on the goal-line between the goal-posts , facing the kicker , without touching the goalposts , crossbar , or goal net . At the moment the kick is taken , the goalkeeper must have at least part of one foot touching , or in line with , the goal line . The assistant referee responsible for the goal line where the penalty kick is being taken is positioned at the intersection of the penalty area and goal line , and assists the referee in looking for infringements and/or whether a goal is scored . The referee blows the whistle to indicate that the penalty kick may be taken . The kicker may make feinting ( deceptive or distracting ) movements during the run-up to the ball , but may not do so once the run-up is completed . The ball must be stationary before the kick , and it must be kicked forward . The ball is in play once it is kicked and moves , and at that time other players may enter the penalty area and penalty arc . The kicker may not touch the ball a second time until it has been touched by another player of either team or goes out of play ( including into the goal ) . Infringements In case of an infringement of the laws of the game during a penalty kick , most commonly entering the penalty area illegally , the referee must consider both whether the ball entered the goal , and which team ( s ) committed the offence . If both teams commit an offence , a rekick is taken . The following infringements committed by the kicking team result in an indirect free kick for the defending team , regardless of the outcome of the kick : a teammate of the identified kicker kicks the ball instead ( the player who took the kick is cautioned ) kicker feints kicking the ball at the end of the run-up ( the kicker is cautioned ) kick does not go forward kicker touches the ball a second time before it touches another player ( includes rebounds off the goal posts or crossbar ) In the case of a player repeatedly infringing the laws during the penalty kick , the referee may caution the player for persistent infringement . All offences that occur before kick may be dealt with in this manner , regardless of the location of the offence . If the ball touches an outside agent ( i.e. , an object foreign to the playing field ) as it moves forward from the kick , the kick is retaken . Tap penalty A two-man penalty , or \" tap \" penalty , occurs when the kicker , instead of shooting for goal , taps the ball slightly forward so that a teammate can run on to it and shoot or pass . If properly executed , it is a legal play since the kicker is not required to shoot for goal and need only kick the ball forward . This strategy relies heavily on the element of surprise , as it first requires the goalkeeper to believe the kicker will actually shoot , then dive or move to one side in response . It then requires the goalkeeper to remain out of position long enough for the kicker \\'s teammate to reach the ball before any defenders , and for that teammate to place a shot on the undefended side of the goal . The first recorded tap penalty was taken by Jimmy McIlroy and Danny Blanchflower of Northern Ireland against Portugal on 1 May 1957 . Another was taken by Rik Coppens and André Piters in the World Cup Qualifying match Belgium v Iceland on 5 June 1957 . Another attempt was made by Mike Trebilcock and John Newman , playing for Plymouth Argyle in 1964 . In 1982 , Johan Cruyff passed to his Ajax team-mate Jesper Olsen , who then passed back , allowing Cruyff to tap in for goal . Arsenal players Thierry Henry and Robert Pires failed in an attempt at a similar penalty in 2005 , during a Premier League match against Manchester City at Highbury . Pires ran in to take the kick , attempted to pass to the onrushing Henry , but miskicked and the ball hardly moved ; as he had slightly touched the ball , he could not touch it again , and City defender Sylvain Distin cleared the ball before Henry could shoot . Lionel Messi tapped a penalty for Luis Suárez as Suárez completed his hat-trick on 14 February 2016 against league opponents Celta de Vigo . Saving tactics \" Reading \" the kicker Defending against a penalty kick is one of the most difficult tasks a goalkeeper can face . Owing to the short distance between the penalty spot and the goal , there is very little time to react to the shot . Because of this , the goalkeeper will usually start his or her dive before the ball is actually struck . In effect , the goalkeeper must act on their best prediction about where the shot will be aimed . Some goalkeepers decide which way they will dive beforehand , thus giving themselves a good chance of diving in time . Others try to read the kicker \\'s motion pattern . On the other side , kickers often feign and prefer a relatively slow shot in an attempt to foil the goalkeeper . The potentially most fruitful approach , shooting high and centre , i.e. , in the space that the goalkeeper will evacuate , also carries the highest risk of shooting above the bar . As the shooter makes his approach to the ball , the goalkeeper has only a fraction of a second to \" read \" the shooter \\'s motions and decide where the ball will go . If their guess is correct , this may result in a missed penalty . Helmuth Duckadam , Steaua București \\'s goalkeeper , saved a record four consecutive penalties in the 1986 European Cup Final against Barcelona . He dived three times to the right and a fourth time to his left to save all penalties taken , securing victory for his team . Use of knowledge of kicker \\'s history A goalkeeper may also rely on knowledge of the shooter \\'s past behaviour to inform his decision . An example of this would be by former Netherlands national team goalkeeper Hans van Breukelen , who always had a box with cards with all the information about the opponent \\'s penalty specialist . Ecuadorian goalkeeper Marcelo Elizaga saving a penalty from Carlos Tevez in a match between Ecuador and Argentina , revealed that he had studied some penalty kicks from Tevez and suspected he was going to shoot to the goalkeeper \\'s left side . Two other examples occurred during the 2006 FIFA World Cup : Portugal national team goalkeeper Ricardo in a quarter-final match against England , where he saved three penalties out of four . The quarter-final match between Argentina and Germany also came down to penalties , and German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was seen looking at a piece of paper kept in his sock before each Argentinian player would come forward for a penalty kick . It is presumed that information on each kicker \\'s \" habits \" were written on this paper . Lehmann saved two of the four penalties taken and came close to saving a third . This approach may not always be successful ; the player may intentionally switch from his favoured spot after witnessing the goalkeeper obtaining knowledge of his kicks . Most times , especially in amateur football , the goalkeeper is often forced to guess . Game theoretic research shows that both the penalty taker and also the goalkeeper must randomize their strategies in precise ways to avoid having the opponent take advantage of their predictability . Distraction The goalkeeper also may try to distract the penalty taker , as the expectation is on the penalty taker to succeed , hence more pressure on the penalty taker , making them more vulnerable to mistakes . For example , in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final between Manchester United and Chelsea , United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar pointed to his left side when Nicolas Anelka stepped up to take a shot in the penalty shoot out . This was because all of Chelsea \\'s penalties went to the left . Anelka \\'s shot instead went to Van der Sar \\'s right , which was saved . Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar used a method of distracting the players called the \" spaghetti legs \" trick to help his club defeat Roma to win the 1984 European Cup . This tactic was emulated in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final , which Liverpool also won , by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek , helping his team defeat Milan . An illegal method of saving penalties is for the goalkeeper to make a quick and short jump forward just before the penalty taker connects with the ball . This not only shuts down the angle of the shot , but also distracts the penalty taker . The method was used by Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel . FIFA was less strict on the rule during that time . In more recent times , FIFA has advised all referees to strictly obey the rule book . Similarly , a goalkeeper may also attempt to delay a penalty by cleaning his boots , asking the referee to see if the ball is placed properly and other delaying tactics . This method builds more pressure on the penalty taker , but the goalkeeper may risk punishments , most likely a yellow card . A goalkeeper can also try to distract the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken . Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica . As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick , Krul told them that he \" knew where they were going to put their penalty \" in order to \" get in their heads \" . This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4–3 . Under new IFAB rule changes , if the penalty taker attempts to feint or dummy the opposing goalkeeper after completing the run-up to the ball , the taker will be punished with a yellow card , and will not be allowed to retake the kick . Scoring statistics Even if the goalkeeper succeeds in blocking the shot , the ball may rebound back to the penalty taker or one of his teammates for another shot , with the goalkeeper often in a poor position to make a second save . This makes saving penalty kicks more difficult . This is not a concern in penalty shoot-outs , where only a single shot is permitted . While penalty kicks are considerably more often successful than not , missed penalty kicks are not uncommon : for instance , of the 78 penalty kicks taken during the 2005–06 English Premier League season , 57 resulted in a goal , thus almost 30 % of the penalties were unsuccessful . A German professor who has been studying penalty statistics in the German Bundesliga for 16 years found 76 % of all the penalties during those 16 years went in , and 99 % of the shots in the higher half of the goal went in , although the higher half of the goal is a more difficult target to aim at . During his career , Italian striker Roberto Baggio had two occurrences where his shot hit the upper bar , bounced downwards , rebounded off the keeper and passed the goal line for a goal . Saving statistics Some goalkeepers have become well known for their ability to save penalty kicks . One such goalkeeper is Brazil \\'s and Flamengo \\'s Diego Alves , who boasts a 49 percent save success rate . Other goalkeepers with high save rates include Claudio Bravo , Kevin Trapp , Samir Handanović , Gianluigi Buffon , Tim Krul , Danijel Subašić , and Manuel Neuer . Offences for which the penalty kick is awarded A penalty kick is awarded whenever one of the following offences is committed by a player within that player \\'s own penalty area while the ball is in play ( the ball must be in play at the time of the offence , but it does not need to be within the penalty-area at that time ) . handball ( excluding handling offences committed by the goalkeeper ) any of the following offences against an opponent , if committed in a manner considered by the referee to be careless , reckless or using excessive force : charges jumps at kicks or attempts to kick pushes strikes or attempts to strike ( including head-butt ) tackles or challenges trips or attempts to trip holding an opponent impeding an opponent with contact biting or spitting at someone throwing an object at the ball , an opponent or a match official , or making contact with the ball with a held object ( the location of the offence is considered to be the position where the object struck or would have struck the person or the ball , or the nearest boundary line if this is off the field of play ) . any physical offence against a team-mate , substitute , substituted or sent-off player , team official or a match official a player who requires the referee \\'s permission to re-enter the field of play , substitute , substituted player , sent-off player , or team official enters the field of play without the referee \\'s permission , and interferes with play a player who requires the referee \\'s permission to re-enter the field of play , substitute , substituted player , sent-off player or team official is on the field of play without the referee \\'s permission while that person \\'s team scores a goal ( the location of the offence is considered to be the location of the offender at the time the goal was scored ) . a player temporarily off the field of play , substitute , substituted player , sent-off player or team official throws or kicks an object onto the field of play , and the object interferes with play , an opponent , or a match official ( the location of the offence is considered to be the place where the thrown or kicked object interfered with play , or struck or would have struck the opponent , match official or the ball ) . A penalty kick is also awarded if , while the ball is in play , a player , substitute , substituted player , sent-off player or team official commits any direct free-kick offence against a match official or against an opposing player , substitute , substituted player , sent-off player , or team official outside the field of play , provided that the closest boundary line to the location of the offence is within the offending team \\'s own penalty area . History Early proposals The original laws of the game , in 1863 , had no defined punishments for infringements of the rules . In 1872 , the indirect free kick was introduced as a punishment for illegal handling of the ball ; it was later extended to other offences . This indirect free-kick was thought to be an inadequate remedy for a handball which prevented an otherwise-certain goal . As a result of this , in 1882 a law was introduced to award a goal to a team prevented from scoring by an opponent \\'s handball . This law lasted only one season before being abolished in 1883 . Introduction of the penalty-kick The invention of the penalty kick is credited to the goalkeeper and businessman William McCrum in 1890 in Milford , County Armagh . The Irish Football Association presented the idea to the International Football Association Board \\'s 1890 meeting , where it was deferred until the next meeting in 1891 . Two incidents in the 1890–1 season lent additional force to the argument for the penalty kick . On 20 December 1890 , in the Scottish Cup quarter-final between East Stirlingshire and Heart of Midlothian Jimmy Adams fisted the ball out from under the bar , and on 14 February 1891 , there was a blatant goal-line handball by a Notts County player in the FA Cup quarter-final against Stoke City Finally after much debate , the International Football Association Board approved the idea on 2 June 1891 . The penalty-kick law ran : Some notable differences between this original 1891 law and today \\'s penalty-kick are listed below : It was awarded for an offence committed within of the goal-line ( the penalty area was not introduced until 1902 ) . It could be taken from any point along a line from the goal-line ( the penalty spot was likewise not introduced until 1902 ) . It was awarded only after an appeal . There was no restriction on dribbling . The ball could be kicked in any direction . The goal-keeper was allowed to advance up to from the goal-line . The world \\'s first penalty kick was awarded to Airdrieonians in 1891 at Broomfield Park , and the first penalty kick in the Football League was awarded to Wolverhampton Wanderers in their match against Accrington at Molineux Stadium on 14 September 1891 . The penalty was taken and scored by Billy Heath as Wolves went on to win the game 5–0 . Subsequent developments In 1892 , the player taking the penalty-kick was forbidden to kick the ball again before the ball had touched another player . A provision was also added that \" [ i ] f necessary , time of play shall be extended to admit of the penalty kick being taken \" . In 1896 , the ball was required to be kicked forward , and the requirement for an appeal was removed . In 1902 , the penalty area was introduced with its current dimensions ( a rectangle extending from the goal-posts ) . The penalty spot was also introduced , from the goal . All other players were required to be outside the penalty area . In 1905 , the goal-keeper was required to remain on the goal-line . In 1923 , all other players were required to be at least from the penalty-spot ( in addition to being outside the penalty-area ) . This change was made in order to stop defenders from lining up on the edge of the penalty area to impede the player taking the kick . In 1930 , a footnote was appended to the laws , stating that \" the goal-keeper must not move his feet until the penalty kick has been taken \" . In 1937 , an arc ( colloquially known as the \" D \" ) was added to the pitch markings , to assist in the enforcement of the restriction . The goal-keeper was required to stand between the goal-posts . In 1939 , it was specified that the ball must travel the distance of its circumference before being in play . In 1997 , this requirement was eliminated : the ball became in play as soon as it was kicked and moved forward . In 2016 , it was specified that the ball must \" clearly \" move . In 1995 , all other players were required to remain behind the penalty spot . The Scottish Football Association claimed that this new provision would \" eliminate various problems which have arisen regarding the position of players who stand in front of the penalty-mark at the taking of a penalty-kick as is presently permitted \" . In 1997 , the goal-keeper was once again allowed to move the feet , and was also required to face the kicker . The question of \" feinting \" during the run-up to a penalty was popularized by Pelé in the 1970s and it was called paradinha , which in Portuguese means “ little stop ” and it has occupied the International FA Board since 1982 , when it decided that \" if a player stops in his run-up it is an offence for which he shall be cautioned ( for ungentlemanly conduct ) by the referee \" . However , in 1985 the same body reversed itself , deciding that the \" assumption that feigning was an offence \" was \" wrong \" , and that it was up to the Referee to decide whether any instance should be penalized as ungentlemanly conduct . From 2000 to 2006 , documents produced by IFAB specified that feinting during the run-up to a penalty-kick was permitted . In 2007 , this guidance emphasized that \" if in the opinion of the referee the feinting is considered an act of unsporting behaviour , the player shall be cautioned \" . In 2010 , because of concern over \" an increasing trend in players feinting a penalty kick to deceive the goalkeeper \" , a proposal was adopted to specify that while \" feinting in the run-up to take a penalty kick to confuse opponents is permitted as part of football \" , \" feinting to kick the ball once the player has completed his run-up is considered an infringement of Law 14 and an act of unsporting behaviour for which the player must be cautioned \" . Summary Offences for which a penalty kick was awarded Since its introduction in 1891 , a penalty kick has been awarded for two broad categories of offences : handball serious offences involving physical contact The number of offences eligible for punishment by a penalty-kick , small when initially introduced in 1891 , expanded rapidly thereafter . This led to some confusion : for example , in September 1891 , a referee awarded a penalty kick against a goalkeeper who \" [ lost ] his temper and [ kicked ] an opponent \" , even though under the 1891 laws this offence was punishable only by an indirect free-kick . The table below shows the punishments specified by the laws for offences involving handling the ball or physical contact , between 1890 and 1903 : Since 1903 , the offences for which a penalty kick is awarded within the defending team \\'s penalty area have been identical to those for which a direct free kick is awarded outside the defending team \\'s penalty area . These consisted of handball ( excluding technical handling offences by the goalkeeper ) , and foul play , with the following exceptions ( which were punished instead by an indirect free kick in the penalty area ) : Dangerous play ( since 1903 ) Obstructing / impeding the progress of an opponent ( 1951–2016 ) and impeding an opponent without contact ( from 2016 ) Charging when not attempting to play the ball ( 1948-1997 ) See also Penalty shoot-out ( association football ) References External links History of Laws of the Game – From 1863 to the Present Day Penalty Kick Games 2014 Irish Examiner article by Dr R Hume Laws of association football Kick ( association football ) Association football skills Association football terminology Articles containing video clips Sports penalties', 'The term Hispanic ( ) refers to people , cultures , or countries related to Spain , the Spanish language , or Hispanidad . The term commonly applies to countries with a cultural and historical link to Spain and to colonies formerly part of the Spanish Empire following the Spanish colonization of the Americas , parts of the Asia-Pacific region and Africa . These are mainly countries of Hispanic America , Philippines , Equatorial Guinea and Western Sahara . In most of these countries Spanish is the predominant or official language and the cultures are derived from Spain to different degrees , combined with the local pre-Hispanic culture or other foreign influences . Hispanic culture is a set of customs , traditions , beliefs , and art forms ( music , literature , dress , architecture , cuisine , or others ) that are generally shared by peoples in Hispanic regions , but which can vary considerably from one country or territory to another . The Spanish language is the main cultural element shared by Hispanic peoples . Terminology The term Hispanic derives from Latin Hispanicus , the adjectival derivation of Latin ( and Greek ) Hispania ( that is , the Iberian peninsula ) , ultimately probably of Celtiberian origin . In English the word is attested from the 16th century ( and in the late 19th century in American English ) . The words Spain , Spanish , and Spaniard are of the same etymology as Hispanus , ultimately . Hispanus was the Latin name given to a person from Hispania during Roman rule . The ancient Roman Hispania , which roughly comprised what is currently called the Iberian Peninsula , included the contemporary states of Portugal , Spain , parts of France , Andorra , and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar . In English , the term Hispano-Roman is sometimes used . The Hispano-Romans were composed of people from many different indigenous tribes , in addition to Italian colonists . Some famous Hispani ( plural of Hispanus ) and Hispaniensis were the emperors Trajan , Marcus Aurelius , Hadrian , Theodosius I and Magnus Maximus , the poets Marcus Annaeus Lucanus , Martial and Prudentius , the philosophers Seneca the Elder and Seneca the Younger , and the usurper Maximus of Hispania . A number of these men , such as Trajan , Hadrian and others , were in fact descended from Roman colonial families . Here follows a comparison of several terms related to Hispanic : Hispania was the name of the Iberian Peninsula/Iberia from the 3rd century BC to the 8th AD , both as a Roman Empire province and immediately thereafter as a Visigothic kingdom , 5th–8th century . Hispano-Roman is used to refer to the culture and people of Hispania . Hispanic is used to refer to modern Spain , to the Spanish language , and to the Spanish-speaking nations of the world , particularly the Americas , Pacific Islands and Asia , such as the Philippines . Spanish is used to refer to the people , nationality , culture , language and other things of Spain . Spaniard is used to refer to the people of Spain . Hispania was divided into two provinces : Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior . In 27 B.C , Hispania Ulterior was divided into two new provinces , Hispania Baetica and Hispania Lusitania , while Hispania Citerior was renamed Hispania Tarraconensis . This division of Hispania explains the usage of the singular and plural forms ( Spain , and The Spains ) used to refer to the peninsula and its kingdoms in the Middle Ages . Before the marriage of Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon in 1469 , the four Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula—the Kingdom of Portugal , the Crown of Aragon , the Crown of Castile , and the Kingdom of Navarre—were collectively called The Spains . This revival of the old Roman concept in the Middle Ages appears to have originated in Provençal , and was first documented at the end of the 11th century . In the Council of Constance , the four kingdoms shared one vote . The word Lusitanian , relates to Lusitania or Portugal , also in reference to the Lusitanians , possibly one of the first Indo-European tribes to settle in Europe . From this tribe \\'s name had derived the name of the Roman province of Lusitania , and Lusitania remains the name of Portugal in Latin . The terms Spain and the Spains were not interchangeable . Spain was a geographic territory , home to several kingdoms ( Christian and Muslim ) , with separate governments , laws , languages , religions , and customs , and was the historical remnant of the Hispano-Gothic unity . Spain was not a political entity until much later , and when referring to the Middle Ages , one should not be confounded with the nation-state of today . The term The Spains referred specifically to a collective of juridico-political units , first the Christian kingdoms , and then the different kingdoms ruled by the same king . Illustrative of this fact is the historical ecclesiastical title of Primate of the Spains , traditionally claimed by the Archbishop of Braga , a Portuguese prelate . With the Decretos de Nueva Planta , Philip V started to organize the fusion of his kingdoms that until then were ruled as distinct and independent , but this unification process lacked a formal and juridic proclamation . Although colloquially and literally the expression \" King of Spain \" or \" King of the Spains \" was already widespread , it did not refer to a unified nation-state . It was only in the constitution of 1812 that was adopted the name Españas ( Spains ) for the Spanish nation and the use of the title of \" king of the Spains \" . The constitution of 1876 adopts for the first time the name \" Spain \" for the Spanish nation and from then on the kings would use the title of \" king of Spain \" . The expansion of the Spanish Empire between 1492 and 1898 brought thousands of Spanish migrants to the conquered lands , who established settlements , mainly in the Americas , but also in other distant parts of the world ( as in the Philippines , the lone Spanish territory in Asia ) , producing a number of multiracial populations . Today , the term Hispanic is typically applied to the varied populations of these places , including those with Spanish ancestry . Because of their historical , linguistic , and cultural ties with Spain , Filipinos can be considered Hispanic . Definitions in ancient Rome The Latin gentile adjectives that belong to Hispania are Hispanus , Hispanicus , and Hispaniensis . A Hispanus is someone who is a native of Hispania with no foreign parents , while children born in Hispania of Roman parents were Hispanienses . Hispaniensis means \\'connected in some way to Hispania \\' , as in \" Exercitus Hispaniensis \" ( \\'the Spanish army \\' ) or \" mercatores Hispanienses \" ( \\'Spanish merchants \\' ) . Hispanicus implies \\'of \\' or \\'belonging to \\' Hispania or the Hispanus or of their fashion as in \" gladius Hispanicus \" . The gentile adjectives were not ethnolinguistic but derived primarily on a geographic basis , from the toponym Hispania as the people of Hispania spoke different languages , although Titus Livius ( Livy ) said they could all understand each other , not making clear if they spoke dialects of the same language or were polyglots . The first recorded use of an anthroponym derived from the toponym Hispania is attested in one of the five fragments , of Ennius in 236 B.C . who wrote \" Hispane , non Romane memoretis loqui me \" ( \" Remember that I speak like a Spaniard not a Roman \" ) as having been said by a native of Hispania . Definitions in Portugal and Spain Technically speaking , persons from Portugal or of Portuguese extraction are referred to as Lusitanians . In Portugal , Hispanic refers to something related to ancient Spain or the Spanish language and culture . Portugal and Spain do not have exactly the same definition for the term Hispanic , but they do share the etymology for the word ( pt : hispânico , es : hispánico ) . The Royal Spanish Academy ( Spanish : Real Academia Española , RAE ) , the official royal institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language defines the terms \" Hispano \" and \" Hispánico \" ( which in Spain have slightly different meanings ) as : Hispano : From Spain Belonging or relative to Spain Spanish , as applied to a person Of or pertaining to Hispanic America Of or pertaining to the population of Hispanic American origin who live in the United States of America A person of this origin who lives in the United States of America People from the Republic of the Philippines Belonging or relative to Spain and Spanish-speaking countries The modern term to identify Portuguese and Spanish territories under a single nomenclature is \" Iberian \" , and the one to refer to cultures derived from both countries in the Americas is \" Iberian-American \" . These designations can be mutually recognized by people in Portugal and Brazil , unlike \" Hispanic \" , which is totally void of any self-identification in those countries , and quite to the contrary , serves the purpose of marking a clear distinction in relation to neighboring countries \\' culture . In Spanish , the term \" hispano \" as in \" hispanoamericano \" , refers to the people of Spanish origin who live in the Americas ; it also refers to a relationship to Hispania or to the Spanish language . There are people in Hispanic America that are not of Spanish origin , as the original people of these areas are Amerindians . Definitions in the United States Both Hispanic and Latino are widely used in American English for Spanish-speaking people and their descendants in the United States . While Hispanic refers to Spanish speakers overall , Latino refers specifically to people of Latin American descent . Hispanic can also be used for the people and culture of Spain as well as Latin America . While originally the term Hispanic referred primarily to the Hispanos of New Mexico within the United States , today , organizations in the country use the term as a broad catchall to refer to persons with a historical and cultural relationship with Spain regardless of race and ethnicity . The United States Census Bureau uses Hispanic or Latino to refer to a person of Cuban , Mexican , Puerto Rican , South or Central American , or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race and states that Hispanics or Latinos can be of any race , any ancestry , any ethnicity . Because of the technical distinctions involved in defining \" race \" vs . \" ethnicity , \" there is confusion among the general population about the designation of Hispanic identity . Currently , the United States Census Bureau defines six race categories : White or Caucasian Black or African American American Indian or Alaska Native Asian Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander Some Other Race According to census reports , of the above races the largest number of Hispanic or Latinos are of the White race , the second largest number come from the Native American/American Indian race who are the indigenous people of the Americas . The inhabitants of Easter Island are Pacific Islanders and since the island belongs to Chile they are theoretically Hispanic or Latino . Because Hispanic roots are considered aligned with a European ancestry ( Spain/Portugal ) , Hispanic ancestry is defined solely as an ethnic designation ( similar to being Norse or Germanic ) . Therefore , a person of Hispanic descent is typically defined using both race and ethnicity as an identifier—i.e. , Black-Hispanic , White-Hispanic , Asian-Hispanic , Amerindian-Hispanic or \" other race \" Hispanic .

Office of Management and Budget defined Hispanic or Latino persons as being \" persons who trace their origin or descent to Mexico , Puerto Rico , Cuba , Central and South America , and other Spanish cultures . \" The United States Census uses the ethnonyms Hispanic or Latino to refer to \" a person of Cuban , Mexican , Puerto Rican , South or Central American , or other Hispanic culture or origin regardless of race . \" The 2010 Census asked if the person was \" Spanish/Hispanic/Latino \" . The United States Census uses the Hispanic or Latino to refer to \" a person of Cuban , Mexican , Puerto Rican , South or Central American , or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race . \" The Census Bureau also explains that \" [ o ] rigin can be viewed as the heritage , nationality group , lineage , or country of birth of the person or the person \\'s ancestors before their arrival in the United States . People who identify their origin as Hispanic , Latino or Spanish may be of any race . \" The U.S . Department of Transportation defines Hispanic as , \" persons of Mexican , Puerto Rican , Cuban , Central or South American , or other Spanish or Portuguese culture or origin , regardless of race . \" This definition has been adopted by the Small Business Administration as well as by many federal , state , and municipal agencies for the purposes of awarding government contracts to minority owned businesses . The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Congressional Hispanic Conference include representatives of Spanish and Portuguese , Puerto Rican and Mexican descent . The Hispanic Society of America is dedicated to the study of the arts and cultures of Spain , Portugal , and Latin America . The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities , proclaimed champions of Hispanic success in higher education , is committed to Hispanic educational success in the U.S. , Puerto Rico , Ibero-America , Spain and Portugal . The U.S . Equal Employment Opportunity Commission encourages any individual who believes that he or she is Hispanic to self-identify as Hispanic . The United States Department of Labor – Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs encourages the same self-identification . As a result , individuals with origins to part of the Spanish Empire may self-identify as Hispanic , because an employer may not override an individual \\'s self-identification . The 1970 Census was the first time that a \" Hispanic \" identifier was used and data collected with the question . The definition of \" Hispanic \" has been modified in each successive census . In a recent study , most Spanish-speakers of Spanish or Hispanic American descent do not prefer the term Hispanic or Latino when it comes to describing their identity . Instead , they prefer to be identified by their country of origin . When asked if they have a preference for either being identified as Hispanic or Latino , the Pew study finds that \" half ( 51 % ) say they have no preference for either term . \" A majority ( 51 % ) say they most often identify themselves by their family \\'s country of origin , while 24 % say they prefer a pan-ethnic label such as Hispanic or Latino . Among those 24 % who have a preference for a pan-ethnic label , \" \\'Hispanic \\' is preferred over \\'Latino \\' by more than a two-to-one margin—33 % versus 14 % . \" 21 % prefer to be referred to simply as \" Americans . \" Hispanicization Hispanicization is the process by which a place or a person absorbs characteristics of Hispanic society and culture . Modern hispanization of a place , namely in the United States , might be illustrated by Spanish-language media and businesses . Hispanization of a person might be illustrated by speaking Spanish , making and eating Hispanic American food , listening to Spanish language music or participating in Hispanic festivals and holidays - Hispanization of those outside the Hispanic community as opposed to assimilation of Hispanics into theirs . One reason that some people believe the assimilation of Hispanics in the U.S . is not comparable to that of other cultural groups is that Hispanic and Latino Americans have been living in parts of North America for centuries , in many cases well before the English-speaking culture became dominant . For example , California , Texas , Colorado , New Mexico ( 1598 ) , Arizona , Nevada , Florida and Puerto Rico have been home to Spanish-speaking peoples since the 16th century , long before the U.S . existed . These and other Spanish-speaking territories were part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain , and later Mexico ( with the exception of Florida and Puerto Rico ) , before these regions joined or were taken over by the United States in 1848 ( Puerto Rico was in 1898 ) . Some cities in the U.S . were founded by Spanish settlers as early as the 16th century , prior to the creation of the Thirteen Colonies . For example , San Miguel de Gualdape , Pensacola and St . Augustine , Florida were founded in 1526 , 1559 and 1565 respectively . Santa Fe , New Mexico was founded in 1604 , and Albuquerque was established in 1660 . El Paso was founded in 1659 , San Antonio in 1691 , Laredo , Texas in 1755 , San Diego in 1769 , San Francisco in 1776 , San Jose , California in 1777 , New Iberia , Louisiana in 1779 , and Los Angeles in 1781 . Therefore , in many parts of the U.S. , the Hispanic cultural legacy predates English/British influence . For this reason , many generations have largely maintained their cultural traditions and Spanish language well before the United States was created . However , Spanish-speaking persons in many Hispanic areas in the U.S . amounted to only a few thousand people when they became part of the United States ; a large majority of current Hispanic residents are descended from Hispanics who entered the United States in the mid-to-late 20th and early 21st centuries . Language retention is a common index to assimilation ; according to the 2000 census , about 75 % of all Hispanics spoke Spanish in the home . Spanish language retention rates vary geographically ; parts of Texas and New Mexico have language retention rates over 90 % , whereas in parts of Colorado and California , retention rates are lower than 30 % . The degree of retention of Spanish as the native language is based on recent arrival from countries where Spanish is spoken . As is true of other immigrants , those who were born in other countries still speak their native language . Later generations are increasingly less likely to speak the language spoken in the country of their ancestors , as is true of other immigrant groups . Spanish-speaking countries and regions Today , Spanish is among the most commonly spoken first languages of the world . During the period of the Spanish Empire from 1492 and 1898 , many people migrated from Spain to the conquered lands . The Spaniards brought with them the Castilian language and culture , and in this process that lasted several centuries , created a global empire with a diverse population . Culturally , Spaniards ( those living in Spain ) are Southern European , but they may also have small traces of DNA to peoples from the rest of Europe and elsewhere . This includes , for example , Germanic and Scandinavian Europe , France , the rest of Mediterranean Europe , or Western Asia and Northern Africa . Language and ethnicities in Spanish-speaking areas around the world Areas with Hispanic cultural influence Culture The Miguel de Cervantes Prize is awarded to Hispanic writers , whereas the Latin Grammy Award recognizes Hispanic musicians , and the Platino Awards as given to outstanding Hispanic films . Music Folk and popular dance and music also varies greatly among Hispanics . For instance , the music from Spain is a lot different from the Hispanic American , although there is a high grade of exchange between both continents . In addition , due to the high national development of the diverse nationalities and regions of Spain , there is a lot of music in the different languages of the Peninsula ( Catalan , Galician and Basque , mainly ) . See , for instance , Music of Catalonia or Rock català , Music of Galicia , Cantabria and Asturias , and Basque music . Flamenco is also a very popular music style in Spain , especially in Andalusia . Spanish ballads \" romances \" can be traced in Argentina as \" milongas \" , same structure but different scenarios . On the other side of the ocean , Hispanic America is also home to a wide variety of music , even though Latin music is often erroneously thought of , as a single genre . Hispanic Caribbean music tends to favor complex polyrhythms of African origin . Mexican music shows combined influences of mostly European and Native American origin , while traditional Northern Mexican music — norteño and banda — polka , has influence from polka music brought by Central European settlers to Mexico which later influenced western music . The music of Hispanic Americans — such as tejano music — has influences in rock , jazz , R & B , pop , and country music as well as traditional Mexican music such as Mariachi . Meanwhile , native Andean sounds and melodies are the backbone of Peruvian and Bolivian music , but also play a significant role in the popular music of most South American countries and are heavily incorporated into the folk music of Ecuador and Chile and the tunes of Colombia , and again in Chile where they play a fundamental role in the form of the greatly followed nueva canción . In U.S . communities of immigrants from these countries it is common to hear these styles . Rock en Español , Latin hip-hop , Salsa , Merengue , Bachata , Cumbia and Reggaeton styles tend to appeal to the broader Hispanic population , and varieties of Cuban music are popular with many Hispanics of all backgrounds . Literature Spanish-language literature and folklore is very rich and is influenced by a variety of countries . There are thousands of writers from many places , and dating from the Middle Ages to the present . Some of the most recognized writers are Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra ( Spain ) , Lope de Vega ( Spain ) , Calderón de la Barca ( Spain ) , Jose Rizal ( Philippines ) , Carlos Fuentes ( Mexico ) , Octavio Paz ( Mexico ) , Miguel Ángel Asturias ( Guatemala ) , George Santayana ( US ) , José Martí ( Cuba ) , Sabine Ulibarri ( US ) , Federico García Lorca ( Spain ) , Miguel de Unamuno ( Spain ) , Gabriel García Márquez ( Colombia ) , Rafael Pombo ( Colombia ) , Horacio Quiroga ( Uruguay ) , Rómulo Gallegos ( Venezuela ) , Luis Rodriguez Varela ( Philippines ) , Rubén Darío ( Nicaragua ) , Mario Vargas Llosa ( Peru ) , Cristina Peri Rossi ( Uruguay ) , Luisa Valenzuela ( Argentina ) , Roberto Quesada ( Honduras ) , Julio Cortázar ( Argentina ) , Pablo Neruda ( Chile ) , Gabriela Mistral ( Chile ) , Jorge Luis Borges ( Argentina ) , Pedro Henríquez Ureña ( Dominican Republic ) , Ernesto Sabato ( Argentina ) , Juan Tomás Ávila Laurel ( Equatorial Guinea ) , Ciro Alegría ( Peru ) , Joaquin Garcia Monge ( Costa Rica ) , Juan León Mera ( Ecuador ) and Jesus Balmori ( Philippines ) . Sports In the majority of the Hispanic countries , association football is the most popular sport . The men \\'s national teams of Argentina , Uruguay and Spain have won the FIFA World Cup a total five times . The Spanish La Liga is one of the most popular in the world , known for FC Barcelona and Real Madrid . Meanwhile , the Argentine Primera División and Mexican Primera División are two of the strongest leagues in the Americas . However , baseball is the most popular sport in some Central American and Caribbean countries ( especially Cuba , Dominican Republic , Puerto Rico , and Venezuela ) , as well as in the diaspora in the United States . Notable Hispanic teams in early baseball are the All Cubans , Cuban Stars and New York Cubans . The Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum recognizes Hispanic baseball personalities . Nearly 30 percent ( 22 percent foreign-born Hispanics ) of MLB players today have Hispanic heritage . Several Hispanic sportspeople have been successful worldwide , such as Diego Maradona , Alfredo di Stefano , Lionel Messi , Diego Forlán ( association football ) , Juan Manuel Fangio , Juan Pablo Montoya , Eliseo Salazar , Fernando Alonso , Marc Gené , Carlos Sainz Sr . and Carlos Sainz Jr . ( auto racing ) , Ángel Nieto , Dani Pedrosa , Jorge Lorenzo , Marc Márquez , Marc Coma , Nani Roma ( motorcycle racing ) , Emanuel Ginóbili , Pau Gasol , Marc Gasol ( basketball ) , Julio César Chávez , Saúl Álvarez , Carlos Monzón ( boxing ) , Miguel Indurain , Alberto Contador , Santiago Botero , Rigoberto Urán , Nairo Quintana ( cycling ) , Roberto de Vicenzo , Ángel Cabrera , Sergio García , Severiano Ballesteros , José María Olazábal ( golf ) , Luciana Aymar ( field hockey ) , Rafael Nadal , Marcelo Ríos , Guillermo Vilas , Gabriela Sabatini , Juan Martín del Potro ( tennis ) . Notable Hispanic sports television networks are ESPN Deportes , Fox Deportes and TyC Sports . Religion The Spanish and the Portuguese took the Roman Catholic faith to their colonies in the Americas , Africa , and Asia ; Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanics . A small but growing number of Hispanics belong to a Protestant denomination . Hispanic Christians form the largest ethno-linguistic group among Christians in the world , about 18 % of the world \\'s Christian population are Hispanic ( around 430 millions ) . In the United States , some 65 % of Hispanics and Latinos report themselves Catholic and 21 % Protestant , with 13 % having no affiliation . A minority among the Roman Catholics , about one in five , are charismatics . Among the Protestant , 85 % are \" Born-again Christians \" and belong to Evangelical or Pentecostal churches . Among the smallest groups , less than 4 % , are Jewish . Christianity Among the Spanish-speaking Catholics , most communities celebrate their homeland \\'s patron saint , dedicating a day for this purpose with festivals and religious services . Some Spanish-speakers in Latin America syncretize Roman Catholicism and African or Native American rituals and beliefs . Such is the case of Santería , popular with Afro-Cubans , which combines old African beliefs in the form of Roman Catholic saints and rituals . Other syncretistic beliefs include Spiritism and Curanderismo . Islam While a tiny minority , there are some Muslims in Latin America , in the US , and in the Philippines . Those in the Philippines live predominantly in Bangsamoro . Judaism There are also Spanish-speaking Jews , most of whom are the descendants of Ashkenazi Jews who migrated from Europe ( German Jews , Russian Jews , Polish Jews , etc . ) to Hispanic America , particularly Argentina , Uruguay , Peru and Cuba ( Argentina is host to the third-largest Jewish population in the Western Hemisphere , after the United States and Canada ) in the 19th century and following World War II . Many Spanish-speaking Jews also originate from the small communities of reconverted descendants of anusim — those whose Spanish Sephardi Jewish ancestors long ago hid their Jewish ancestry and beliefs in fear of persecution by the Spanish Inquisition in the Iberian Peninsula and Ibero-America . The Spanish Inquisition led to many forced conversions of Spanish Jews . Genetic studies on the ( male ) Y-chromosome conducted by the University of Leeds in 2008 appear to support the idea that the number of forced conversions have been previously underestimated significantly . They found that twenty percent of Spanish males have Y-chromosomes associated with Sephardic Jewish ancestry . This may imply that there were more forced conversions than was previously thought . There are also thought to be many Catholic-professing descendants of marranos and Spanish-speaking crypto-Jews in the Southwestern United States and scattered through Hispanic America . Additionally , there are Sephardic Jews who are descendants of those Jews who fled Spain to Turkey , Syria , and North Africa , some of whom have now migrated to Hispanic America , holding on to some Spanish/Sephardic customs , such as the Ladino language , which mixes Spanish , Hebrew , Arabic and others , though written with Hebrew and Latin characters . Ladinos were also African slaves captive in Spain held prior to the colonial period in the Americas .

Widely regarded as one of the greatest players in the history of the sport , he was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the 20th Century award . Maradona \\'s vision , passing , ball control , and dribbling skills were combined with his small stature , which gave him a low centre of gravity allowing him to manoeuvre better than most other players . His presence and leadership on the field had a great effect on his team \\'s general performance , while he would often be singled out by the opposition . In addition to his creative abilities , he possessed an eye for goal and was known to be a free kick specialist . A precocious talent , Maradona was given the nickname \" El Pibe de Oro \" ( \" The Golden Boy \" ) , a name that stuck with him throughout his career . He also had a troubled off-field life and was banned in both 1991 and 1994 for abusing drugs . An advanced playmaker who operated in the classic number 10 position , Maradona was the first player to set the world record transfer fee twice : in 1982 when he transferred to Barcelona for £5 million , and in 1984 when he moved to Napoli for a fee of £6.9 million . He played for Argentinos Juniors , Boca Juniors , Barcelona , Napoli , Sevilla , and Newell \\'s Old Boys during his club career , and is most famous for his time at Napoli where he won numerous accolades . In his international career with Argentina , he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals . Maradona played in four FIFA World Cups , including the 1986 World Cup in Mexico , where he captained Argentina and led them to victory over West Germany in the final , and won the Golden Ball as the tournament \\'s best player . In the 1986 World Cup quarter final , he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history for two different reasons . The first goal was an unpenalized handling foul known as the \" Hand of God \" , while the second goal followed a dribble past five England players , voted \" Goal of the Century \" by FIFA.com voters in 2002 . Maradona became the coach of Argentina \\'s national football team in November 2008 . He was in charge of the team at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa before leaving at the end of the tournament . He then coached Dubai-based club Al Wasl in the UAE Pro-League for the 2011–12 season . In 2017 , Maradona became the coach of Fujairah before leaving at the end of the season . In May 2018 , Maradona was announced as the new chairman of Belarusian club Dynamo Brest . He arrived in Brest and was presented by the club to start his duties in July . From September 2018 to June 2019 , Maradona was coach of Mexican club Dorados . He was the coach of Argentine Primera División club Gimnasia de La Plata from September 2019 until his death in November 2020 . Early years Diego Armando Maradona was born on 30 October 1960 , at the Policlínico ( Polyclinic ) Evita Hospital in Lanús , Buenos Aires Province to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province ; he was raised in Villa Fiorito , a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires , Argentina . He was the first son after four daughters . He has two younger brothers , Hugo ( el Turco ) and Raúl ( Lalo ) , both of whom were also professional football players . His father Diego Maradona \" Chitoro \" ( 1927–2015 ) , who worked at a chemicals factory , was of Guaraní ( Indigenous ) and Spanish ( Basque ) descent , and his mother Dalma Salvadora Franco , \" Doña Tota \" ( 1930–2011 ) , was of Italian descent . Maradona \\'s parents were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes , living only two hundred metres from each other on the banks of the Corriente River . In 1950 , they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires . Maradona received his first football as a gift at age three and quickly became devoted to the game . At age eight , Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighbourhood club Estrella Roja . He became a staple of Los Cebollitas ( The Little Onions ) , the junior team of Buenos Aires \\'s Argentinos Juniors . As a 12-year-old ball boy , he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games . He named Brazilian playmaker Rivellino and Manchester United winger George Best among his inspirations growing up . Club career Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors On 20 October 1976 , Maradona made his professional debut for Argentinos Juniors , 10 days before his 16th birthday , vs . Talleres de Córdoba . He entered to the pitch wearing the number 16 jersey , and became the youngest player in the history of the Argentine Primera División . A few minutes after debuting , Maradona kicked the ball through Juan Domingo Cabrera \\'s legs , making a nutmeg that would become legendary . After the game , Maradona said , \" That day I felt I had held the sky in my hands . \" Thirty years later , Cabrera remembered Maradona \\'s debut : \" I was on the right side of the field and went to press him , but he did n\\'t give me a chance . He made the nutmeg and when I turned around , he was far away from me \" . Maradona scored his first goal in the Primera División against Marplatense team San Lorenzo on 14 November 1976 , two weeks after turning 16 . Maradona spent five years at Argentinos Juniors , from 1976 to 1981 , scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his US $ 4 million transfer to Boca Juniors . Maradona received offers to join other clubs , including River Plate who offered to make him the club \\'s best paid player . However , River decided to drop its bid due to its large payroll in keeping Daniel Passarella and Ubaldo Fillol . Maradona signed a contract with Boca Juniors on 20 February 1981 . He made his debut two days later against Talleres de Córdoba , scoring twice in the club \\'s 4–1 win . On 10 April , Maradona played his first Superclásico against River Plate at La Bombonera stadium . Boca defeated River 3–0 with Maradona scoring a goal after dribbling past Alberto Tarantini and Fillol . Despite the distrustful relationship between Maradona and Boca Juniors manager , Silvio Marzolini , Boca had a successful season , winning the league title after securing a point against Racing Club . That would be the only title won by Maradona in the Argentine domestic league . Barcelona After the 1982 World Cup , in June , Maradona was transferred to Barcelona in Spain for a then world record fee of £5 million ( $ 7.6 million ) . In 1983 , under coach César Luis Menotti , Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey ( Spain \\'s annual national cup competition ) , beating Real Madrid , and the Spanish Super Cup , beating Athletic Bilbao . On 26 June 1983 , Barcelona won away to Real Madrid in one of the world \\'s biggest club games , El Clásico , a match where Maradona scored and became the first Barcelona player to be applauded by arch-rival Real Madrid fans . Maradona dribbled past Madrid goalkeeper Agustín , and as he approached the empty goal , he stopped just as Madrid defender Juan José came sliding in an attempt to block the shot . José ended up crashing into the post , before Maradona slotted the ball into the net . With the manner in which the goal was scored resulting in applause from opposition fans , only Ronaldinho ( in November 2005 ) and Andrés Iniesta ( in November 2015 ) have since been granted such an ovation as Barcelona players from Madrid fans at the Santiago Bernabéu . Due to illness and injury as well as controversial incidents on the field , Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona . First a bout of hepatitis , then a broken ankle in a La Liga game at the Camp Nou in September 1983 caused by a reckless tackle by Athletic Bilbao \\'s Andoni Goikoetxea—nicknamed \" the Butcher of Bilbao \" —threatened to jeopardize Maradona \\'s career , but with treatment and rehabilitation , it was possible for him to return to the pitch after a three-month recovery period . Maradona was directly involved in a violent and chaotic fight at the 1984 Copa del Rey Final at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium in Madrid against Athletic Bilbao . After receiving another hard tackle by Goikoetxea , as well as being taunted with racist insults related to his father \\'s Native American ancestry throughout the match by Bilbao fans , and being provoked by Bilbao \\'s Miguel Sola at full time after Barcelona lost 1–0 , Maradona snapped . He aggressively got up , stood inches from Sola \\'s face and the two exchanged words . This started a chain reaction of emotional reactions from both teams . Using expletives , Sola mimicked a gesture from the crowd towards Maradona by using a xenophobic term . Maradona then headbutted Sola , elbowed another Bilbao player in the face and kneed another player in the head , knocking him out cold . The Bilbao squad surrounded Maradona to exact some retribution , with Goikoetxea connecting with a high kick to his chest , before the rest of the Barcelona squad joined in to help Maradona . From this point , Barcelona and Bilbao players brawled on the field with Maradona in the centre of the action , kicking and punching anyone in a Bilbao shirt . The mass brawl was played out in front of the Spanish King Juan Carlos and an audience of 100,000 fans inside the stadium , and more than half of Spain watching on television . After fans began throwing solid objects on the field at the players , coaches and even photographers , sixty people were injured , with the incident effectively sealing Maradona \\'s transfer out of the club in what was his last game in a Barcelona shirt . One Barcelona executive stated , \" When I saw those scenes of Maradona fighting and the chaos that followed I realized we could n\\'t go any further with him . \" Maradona got into frequent disputes with FC Barcelona executives , particularly club president Josep Lluís Núñez , culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984 . During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona , Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games . Maradona transferred to Napoli in Italy \\'s Serie A for another world record fee , £6.9 million ( $ 10.48 million ) . Napoli Maradona arrived in Naples and was presented to the world media as a Napoli player on 5 July 1984 , where he was welcomed by 75,000 fans at his presentation at the Stadio San Paolo . Sports writer David Goldblatt commented , \" They [ the fans ] were convinced that the saviour had arrived . \" A local newspaper stated that despite the lack of a \" mayor , houses , schools , buses , employment and sanitation , none of this matters because we have Maradona \" . Prior to Maradona \\'s arrival , Italian football was dominated by teams from the north and centre of the country , such as A.C . Milan , Juventus , Inter Milan , and Roma , and no team in the south of the Italian Peninsula had ever won a league title . This was perhaps the perfect scenario for the Maradona and his working-class-sympathetic image , as he joined a once-great team that was facing relegation at the end of the 1983-84 Serie A season , in what was the toughest and most highly regarded football league in Europe . At Napoli , Maradona reached the peak of his professional career : he soon inherited the captain \\'s armband from Napoli veteran defender Giuseppe Bruscolotti and quickly became an adored star among the club \\'s fans ; in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history . Maradona played for Napoli at a period when north–south tensions in Italy were at a peak due to a variety of issues , notably the economic differences between the two . Led by Maradona , Napoli won their first ever Serie A Italian Championship in 1986–87 . Goldblatt wrote , \" The celebrations were tumultuous . A rolling series of impromptu street parties and festivities broke out contagiously across the city in a round-the-clock carnival which ran for over a week . The world was turned upside down . The Neapolitans held mock funerals for Juventus and Milan , burning their coffins , their death notices announcing \\'May 1987 , the other Italy has been defeated . A new empire is born . \\' \" Murals of Maradona were painted on the city \\'s ancient buildings , and newborn children were named in his honour . The following season , the team \\'s prolific attacking trio , formed by Maradona , Bruno Giordano , and Careca , was later dubbed the \" Ma-Gi-Ca \" ( magical ) front-line . Napoli would win their second league title in 1989–90 , and finish runners up in the league twice , in 1987–88 and 1988–89 . Other honours during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987 ( as well as a second-place finish in the Coppa Italia in 1989 ) , the UEFA Cup in 1989 , and the Italian Supercup in 1990 . During the 1989 UEFA Cup Final against Stuttgart , Maradona scored from a penalty in a 2–1 home victory in the first leg , later assisting Careca \\'s match–winning goal , while in the second leg on 17 May – a 3–3 away draw – , he assisted Ciro Ferrara \\'s goal with a header . Despite primarily playing in a creative role as an attacking midfielder , Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987–88 with 15 goals , and was the all-time leading goalscorer for Napoli , with 115 goals , until his record was broken by Marek Hamšík in 2017 . When asked who was the toughest player he ever faced , A.C . Milan central defender Franco Baresi stated it was Maradona , a view shared by his Milan teammate Paolo Maldini . Although Maradona was successful on the field during his time in Italy , his personal problems increased . His cocaine use continued , and he received US $ 70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices , ostensibly because of \" stress \" . He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son , and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra crime syndicate . He also faced intense backlash and harassment from some local fans after the 1990 World Cup , in which he and Argentina beat Italy in a semi-final match- at the San Paolo stadium . In 2000 , the number 10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired . On 4 December 2020 , nine days after Maradona \\'s death , Napoli \\'s home stadium was renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona . Late career After serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine , Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992 . Despite interest from Real Madrid and Marseille , he signed for Sevilla , where he stayed for one year . In 1993 , he played for Newell \\'s Old Boys and in 1995 returned to Boca Juniors for a two-year stint . Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a testimonial match for Osvaldo Ardiles against Internazionale , shortly before the 1986 World Cup . In 1996 , he played in a friendly match alongside his brother Raul for Toronto Italia against the Canadian National Soccer League All-Stars . Maradona was himself given a testimonial match in November 2001 , played between an all-star World XI and the Argentina national team . International career During his time with the Argentina national team , Maradona scored 34 goals in 91 appearances . He made his full international debut at age 16 , against Hungary , on 27 February 1977 . Maradona was left off the Argentine squad for the 1978 World Cup on home soil by coach César Luis Menotti who felt he was too young at age 17 . At age 18 , Maradona played the 1979 FIFA World Youth Championship in Japan and emerged as the star of the tournament , shining in Argentina \\'s 3–1 final win over the Soviet Union , scoring a total of six goals in six appearances in the tournament . On 2 June 1979 , Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3–1 win against Scotland at Hampden Park . He went on to play for Argentina in two 1979 Copa América ties during August 1979 , a 2–1 loss against Brazil and a 3–0 win over Bolivia in which he scored his side \\'s third goal . Speaking thirty years later on the impact of Maradona \\'s performances in 1979 , FIFA President Sepp Blatter stated , \" Everyone has an opinion on Diego Armando Maradona , and that ’ s been the case since his playing days . My most vivid recollection is of this incredibly gifted kid at the second FIFA U-20 World Cup in Japan in 1979 . He left everyone open-mouthed every time he got on the ball . \" Maradona and his compatriot Lionel Messi are the only players to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup . Maradona did so in 1979 and 1986 , which Messi emulated in 2005 and 2014 . 1982 World Cup Maradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982 in his new country of residence , Spain . Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup at the Camp Nou in Barcelona . The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Maradona in action , but he did not perform to expectations , as Argentina , the defending champions , lost 1–0 . Although the team convincingly beat both Hungary and El Salvador in Alicante to progress to the second round , there were internal tensions within the team , with the younger , less experienced players at odds with the older , more experienced players . With a team that also included such players as Mario Kempes , Osvaldo Ardiles , Ramón Díaz , Daniel Bertoni , Alberto Tarantini , Ubaldo Fillol , and Daniel Passarella , the Argentine side was defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy . The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile , as Italy beat Argentina at the Sarrià Stadium in Barcelona , 2–1 . Maradona played in all five matches without being substituted , scoring twice against Hungary . He was fouled repeatedly in all five games and particularly in the last one against Brazil at the Sarrià , a game that was blighted by poor officiating and violent fouls . With Argentina already down 3–0 to Brazil , Maradona \\'s temper eventually got the better of him and he was sent off with five minutes remaining for a serious retaliatory foul against Batista . 1986 World Cup Maradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 World Cup in Mexico , winning the final in Mexico City against West Germany . Throughout the tournament , Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the competition . He played every minute of every Argentina game , scoring five goals and making five assists , three of those in the opening match against South Korea at the Olímpico Universitario Stadium in Mexico City . His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game in Puebla . Argentina eliminated Uruguay in the first knockout round in Puebla , setting up a match against England at the Azteca Stadium , also in Mexico City . After scoring two contrasting goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win against England , his legend was cemented . The majesty of his second goal and the notoriety of his first led to the French newspaper L\\'Équipe describing Maradona as \" half-angel , half-devil \" . This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom . Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand . Maradona was coyly evasive , describing it as \" a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God \" . It became known as the \" Hand of God \" . Ultimately , on 22 August 2005 , Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely , and no contact with his head was made , and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate . This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history . The goal stood , much to the wrath of the English players . Maradona \\'s second goal , just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal , was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup . He received the ball in his own half , swivelled around and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field , dribbling past five English outfield players ( Peter Beardsley , Steve Hodge , Peter Reid , Terry Butcher , and Terry Fenwick ) before he left goalkeeper Peter Shilton on his backside with a feint , and slotted the ball into the net . This goal was voted \" Goal of the Century \" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA . A 2002 Channel 4 poll in the UK saw his performance ranked number 6 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments . Maradona followed this with two more goals in a semi-final match against Belgium at the Azteca , including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal . In the final match , West Germany attempted to contain him by double-marking , but he nevertheless found the space past the West German player Lothar Matthäus to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal . Argentina beat West Germany 3–2 in front of 115,000 fans at the Azteca with Maradona lifting the World Cup as captain . During the tournament , Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina \\'s shots , attempted a tournament-best 90 dribbles – three times more than any other player – and was fouled a record 53 times , winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player . Maradona scored or assisted 10 of Argentina \\'s 14 goals ( 71 % ) , including the assist for the winning goal in the final , ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history . By the end of the World Cup , Maradona went on to win the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly , something that he later stated he did not entirely agree with . Zinedine Zidane , watching the 1986 World Cup as a 14-year-old , stated Maradona \" was on another level \" . In a tribute to him , Azteca Stadium authorities built a statue of him scoring the \" Goal of the Century \" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium . Regarding Maradona \\'s performance at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico , in 2014 , Roger Bennett of ESPN FC described it as \" the most virtuoso performance a World Cup has ever witnessed , \" while Kevin Baxter of the Los Angeles Times called it \" one of the greatest individual performances in tournament history , \" with Steven Goff of The Washington Post dubbing his performance as \" one of the finest in tournament annals . \" In 2002 , Russell Thomas of The Guardian described Maradona \\'s second goal against England in the 1986 World Cup quarter-finals as \" arguably the greatest individual goal ever . \" In a 2009 article for CBC Sports , John Molinaro described the goal as \" the greatest ever scored in the tournament – and , maybe , in soccer . \" In a 2018 article for Sportsnet , he added : \" No other player , not even Pel [ é ] in 1958 nor Paolo Rossi in 1982 , had dominated a single competition the way Maradona did in Mexico . \" He also went on to say of Maradona \\'s performance : \" The brilliant Argentine artist single-handedly delivered his country its second World Cup . \" Regarding his two memorable goals against England in the quarter-finals , he commented : \" Yes , it was Maradona ’ s hand , and not God ’ s , that was responsible for the first goal against England . But while the \\'Hand of God \\' goal remains one of the most contentious moments in World Cup history , there can be no disputing that his second goal against England ranks as the greatest ever scored in the tournament . It transcended mere sports – his goal was pure art . \" 1990 World Cup Maradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 World Cup in Italy to yet another World Cup final . An ankle injury affected his overall performance , and he was much less dominant than four years earlier , and the team were missing three of their best players due to injury . After losing their opening game to Cameroon at the San Siro in Milan , Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round , only qualifying in third position from their group . In the round of 16 match against Brazil in Turin , Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona . In the quarter-final , Argentina faced Yugoslavia in Florence ; the match ended 0–0 after 120 minutes , with Argentina advancing in a penalty shootout even though Maradona \\'s kick , a weak shot to the goalkeeper \\'s right , was saved . The semi-final against the host nation Italy at Maradona \\'s club stadium in Naples , the Stadio San Paolo , was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw . This time , however , Maradona was successful with his effort , daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his unsuccessful kick in the previous round . At the final in Rome , Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany , the only goal being a controversial penalty scored by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute , after Rudi Völler was adjudged to be fouled . 1994 World Cup At the 1994 World Cup in the United States , Maradona played in only two games ( both at the Foxboro Stadium near Boston ) , scoring one goal against Greece , before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping . After scoring Argentina \\'s third goal against Greece , Maradona had one of the most remarkable World Cup goal celebrations as he ran towards one of the sideline cameras shouting with a distorted face and bulging eyes , in sheer elation of his return to international football . This turned out to be Maradona \\'s last international goal for Argentina . In the second game , a 2–1 victory over Nigeria which was to be his last game for Argentina , he set up both of his team \\'s goals on free kicks , the second an assist to Caniggia , in what were 2 very strong showings by the Argentine team . In his autobiography , Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the energy drink Rip Fuel . His claim was that the U.S . version , unlike the Argentine one , contained the chemical and that , having run out of his Argentine dosage , his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S . formula . FIFA expelled him from USA \\'94 , and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the round of 16 by Romania in Los Angeles , having been a weaker team without Maradona , even with players like Gabriel Batistuta and Cannigia on the squad . Maradona also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA , on which the organization reneged , to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play . His failed drug test at the 1994 World Cup signalled the end of his international career , which lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games , including one winner \\'s medal and one runners-up medal in the World Cup . Outwith official internationals , Maradona also played and scored for an Argentina XI against the World XI in 1978 to mark the first anniversary of their first World Cup win , scored for The Americas against the World in a UNICEF fundraiser a short time after the 1986 triumph , a year after that captained the \\'Rest of the World \\' against the English Football League XI to celebrate the organisation \\'s centenary ( after reportedly securing a £100,000 appearance fee ) and was on the scoresheet for the Argentina XI once more in his own \\'farewell match \\' in 2001 . Player profile Style of play Described as a \" classic number 10 \" in the media , Maradona was a traditional playmaker who usually played in a free role , either as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards , or as a second striker in a front–two , although he was also deployed as an offensive–minded central midfielder in a 4–4–2 formation on occasion . Maradona was renowned for his dribbling ability , vision , close ball control , passing , and creativity , and is considered to have been one of the most skilful players in the sport . He had a compact physique , and with his strong legs , low center of gravity , and resulting balance , he could withstand physical pressure well while running with the ball , despite his small stature , while his acceleration , quick feet , and agility , combined with his dribbling skills and close control at speed , allowed him to change direction quickly , making him difficult for opponents to defend against . On his dribbling ability , former Dutch player Johan Cruyff saw similarities between Maradona and Lionel Messi with the ball seemingly attached to their boot . His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup . Although he was known for his penchant for undertaking individual runs with the ball , he was also a strategist and an intelligent team player , with excellent spatial awareness , as well as being highly technical with the ball . He was effective in limited spaces , and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee ( as in the second goal against England in 1986 ) , or give an assist to a free teammate . Being short , but strong , he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot . He showed leadership qualities on the field and captained Argentina in their World Cup campaigns of 1986 , 1990 , and 1994 . While he was primarily a creative playmaker , Maradona was also known for his finishing and goalscoring ability . Former Milan manager Arrigo Sacchi also praised Maradona for his defensive work-rate off the ball in a 2010 interview with Il Corriere dello Sport . The team leader on and off the field – he would speak up on a range of issues on behalf of the players – Maradona \\'s ability as a player and his overpowering personality had a major positive effect on his team , with his 1986 World Cup teammate Jorge Valdano stating : Lauding the \" charisma \" of Maradona , another of his Argentina teammates , prolific striker Gabriel Batistuta , stated , \" Diego could command a stadium , have everyone watch him . I played with him and I can tell you how technically decisive he was for the team \" . Napoli \\'s former president – Corrado Ferlaino – commented on Maradona \\'s leadership qualities during his time with the club in 2008 , describing him as \" a coach on the pitch . \" One of Maradona \\'s trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing , and on reaching the opponent \\'s goal line , delivering accurate passes to his teammates . Another trademark was the rabona , a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight . This manoeuvre led to several assists , such as the cross for Ramón Díaz \\'s header against Switzerland in 1980 . Moreover , he was also a well–known proponent of the roulette , a feint which involved him dragging the ball back first with one foot and then the other , while simultaneously performing a 360° turn ; due to his penchant for using this move , it has even occasionally been described as the \" Maradona turn \" in the media . He was also a dangerous free kick and penalty kick taker , who was renowned for his ability to bend the ball from corners and direct set pieces . Regarded as one of the best dead-ball specialists of all time , his free kick technique , which often saw him raise his knee at a high angle when striking the ball , thus enabling him to lift it high over the wall , allowed him to score free kicks even from close range , within 22 to 17 yards ( 20 to 16 metres ) from the goal , or even just outside the penalty area . His style of taking free kicks influenced several other specialists , including Gianfranco Zola , Andrea Pirlo , and Lionel Messi . Maradona was famous for his cunning personality . Some critics view his controversial \" Hand of God \" goal at the 1986 World Cup as a clever manoeuvre , with one of the opposition players , Glenn Hoddle , admitting that Maradona had disguised it by flicking his head at the same time as palming the ball . The goal itself has been viewed as an embodiment of the Buenos Aires shanty town Maradona was brought up in and its concept of viveza criolla— \" cunning of the criollos \" . Although critical of the illegitimate first goal , England striker Gary Lineker conceded , \" When Diego scored that second goal against us , I felt like applauding . It was impossible to score such a beautiful goal . He \\'s the greatest player of all time , by a long way . A genuine phenomenon . \" Maradona used his hand in the 1990 World Cup , again without punishment , and this time on his own goal line , to prevent the Soviet Union from scoring . A number of publications have referred to Maradona as the Artful Dodger , the urchin pickpocket from Charles Dickens \\' Oliver Twist . Maradona was dominantly left-footed , often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection . His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such ; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot , requiring more technical ability . During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \" Goal of the Century \" he did not use his right foot once , despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch . In the 1990 World Cup second-round tie against Brazil , he used his right foot to set up the winning goal for Claudio Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical . Reception Maradona is widely regarded as the best player of his generation . He is considered one of the greatest players of all time by pundits , players , and managers , and by some as the best player ever . Known as one of the most skillful players in the game , he is regarded as one of the greatest dribblers and free kick takers in history . A precocious talent in his youth , in addition to his playing ability , Maradona also drew praise from his former manager Menotti for his dedication , determination , and the work-ethic he demonstrated in order to improve the technical aspect of his game in training , despite his natural gifts , with the manager noting : \" I \\'m always cautious about using the word \\'genius \\' . I find it hard to apply that even to Mozart . The beauty of Diego \\'s game has a hereditary element – his natural ease with the ball – but it also owes a lot to his ability to learn : a lot of those brushstrokes , those strokes of \\'genius \\' , are in fact a product of his hard work . Diego worked very hard to be the best . \" Maradona \\'s former Napoli manager – Ottavio Bianchi – also praised his discipline in training , commenting : \" Diego is different to the one that they depict . When you got him on his own he was a very good kid . It was beautiful to watch him and coach him . They all speak of the fact that he did not train , but it was not true because Diego was the last person to leave the pitch , it was necessary to send him away because otherwise he would stay for hours to invent free kicks . \" However , although , as Bianchi noted , Maradona was known for making \" great plays \" and doing \" unimaginable \" and \" incredible things \" with the ball during training sessions , and would even go through periods of rigorous exercise , he was equally known for his limited work-rate in training without the ball , and even gained a degree of infamy during his time in Italy for missing training sessions with Napoli , while he often trained independently instead of with his team . In a 2019 documentary film on his life , Diego Maradona , Maradona confessed that his weekly regime consisted of \" playing a game on Sunday , going out until Wednesday , then hitting the gym on Thursday . \" Regarding his inconsistent training regimen , the film \\'s director , Asif Kapadia , commented in 2020 : \" He had a metabolism . He would look so incredibly out of shape , but then he ’ d train like crazy and sweat it off by the time matchday came along . His body shape just didn ’ t look like a footballer , but then he had this ability and this balance . He had a way of being , and that idea of talking to him honestly about how a typical week transpired was pretty amazing . \" He also revealed that Maradona was ahead of his time in the fact that he had a personal fitness coach – Fernando Signorini – who trained him in a variety of areas , in addition to looking after his physical conditioning , adding : \" While he [ Maradona ] was in a football team he had his own regime . How many players would do that ? How many players would even know to think like that ? \\' I ’ m different to anyone else so I need to train at what I ’ m good at and what I ’ m weak at . \\' Signorini is very well read and very intelligent . He would literally say , \\'This is the way I ’ m going to train you , read this book . \\' He would help him psychologically , talk to him about philosophy , and things like that . \" Moreover , Maradona was notorious for his poor diet and extreme lifestyle off the pitch , including his use of illicit drugs and alcohol abuse , which along with personal issues , his metabolism , medication that he was prescribed , and periods of inactivity due to injuries and suspensions , led to his significant weight–gain and physical decline as his career progressed ; his lack of discipline and difficulties in his turbulent personal life are thought by some in the sport to have negatively impacted his performances and longevity in the later years of his playing career . A controversial figure in the sport , while he earned critical acclaim from players , pundits , and managers over his playing style , he also drew criticism in the media for his temper and confrontational behaviour , both on and off the pitch . However , in 2005 , Paolo Maldini , described Maradona both as the greatest player he ever faced , and also as the most honest , stating : \" He was a model of good behaviour on the pitch – he was respectful of everyone , from the great players down to the ordinary team member . He was always getting kicked around and he never complained – not like some of today \\'s strikers . \" Franco Baresi stated when he was asked who was his greatest opponent : \" Maradona ; when he was on form , there was almost no way of stopping him , \" while fellow former Italy defender Giuseppe Bergomi described Maradona as the greatest player of all time in 2018 . Zlatan Ibrahimović said that his off-field antics did not matter , and that he should only be judged for the impact he made on the field . \" For me Maradona is more than football . What he did as a footballer , in my opinion , he will be remembered forever . When you see number 10 who do you think about ? Maradona . It is a symbol , even today there are those who choose that number for him . \" In 1999 , Maradona was placed second behind Pelé by World Soccer in the magazine \\'s list of the \" 100 Greatest Players of the 20th Century \" . Along with Pelé , Maradona was one of the two joint winners of the \" FIFA Player of the Century \" award in 2000 , and also placed fifth in \" IFFHS \\' Century Elections \" . In a 2014 FIFA poll , Maradona was voted the second-greatest number 10 of all-time , behind only Pelé , and later that year , was ranked second in The Guardians list of the 100 greatest World Cup players of all-time , ahead of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil , once again behind Pelé . In 2017 , FourFourTwo ranked him in first place in their list of \" 100 greatest players , \" while in 2018 , he was ranked in first place by the same magazine in their list of the \" Greatest Football Players in World Cup History \" ; in March 2020 , he was also ranked first by Jack Gallagher of 90min.com in their list of \" Top 50 Greatest Players of All Time \" . In May 2020 , Sky Sports ranked Maradona as the best player never to have won the UEFA Champions League/European Cup . Retirement and tributes Hounded for years by the press , Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters whom he claimed were invading his privacy . This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarizes the feelings of many : In 1990 , the Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award , one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina , as the most important personality in Sports in the last decade in his country . In April 1996 , Maradona had a three-round exhibition boxing match with Santos Laciar for charity . In 2000 , Maradona published his autobiography Yo Soy El Diego ( \" I am The Diego \" ) , which became a best-seller in Argentina . Two years later , Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \" the Cuban people and Fidel \" . In 2000 , he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website , their official magazine and a grand jury . Maradona won the Internet-based poll , garnering 53.6 % of the votes against 18.53 % for Pelé . In spite of this , and shortly before the ceremony , FIFA added a second award and appointed a \" Football Family \" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pelé the title of best player of the century to make it a draw . Maradona also came fifth in the vote of the IFFHS ( International Federation of Football History and Statistics ) . In 2001 , the Argentine Football Association ( AFA ) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona . FIFA did not grant the request , even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would . Maradona has topped a number of fan polls , including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup ; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team . On 22 March 2010 , Maradona was chosen number 1 in \\'The Greatest 10 World Cup Players of All Time \\' by the London-based newspaper The Times . Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003 . In 2003 , Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi , the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi , as a \" technical consultant \" , while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club , Perugia , which was playing in Serie A at the time . On 22 June 2005 , it was announced that Maradona would return to former club Boca Juniors as a sports vice-president in charge of managing the First Division roster ( after a disappointing 2004–05 season , which coincided with Boca \\'s centenary ) . His contract began 1 August 2005 , and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective : advising the club to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach . With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players , Boca won the 2005 Apertura , the 2006 Clausura , the 2005 Copa Sudamericana , and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana . On 15 August 2005 , Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television , La Noche del 10 ( \" The Night of the no . 10 \" ) . His main guest on opening night was Pelé ; the two had a friendly chat , showing no signs of past differences . However , the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pelé . In subsequent evenings , he led the ratings on all occasions but one . Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business , including Ronaldo and Zinedine Zidane , but also included interviews with other notable friends and personalities such as Cuban leader Fidel Castro and boxers Roberto Durán and Mike Tyson . Maradona gave each of his guests a signed Argentina jersey , which Tyson wore when he arrived in Brazil , Argentina \\'s biggest rivals . In November 2005 , however , Maradona rejected an offer to work with Argentina \\'s national football team . In May 2006 , Maradona agreed to take part in UK \\'s Soccer Aid ( a program to raise money for UNICEF ) . In September 2006 , Maradona , in his famous blue and white number 10 , was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain . On 26 August 2006 , it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA , who selected Alfio Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national team . In 2008 , Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made Maradona , a documentary about Maradona \\'s life . On 1 September 2014 , Maradona , along with many current and former footballing stars , took part in the \" Match for Peace \" , which was played at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome , with the proceeds being donated entirely to charity . Maradona set up a goal for Roberto Baggio during the first half of the match , with a chipped through-ball over the defence with the outside of his left foot . Unusually , both Baggio and Maradona wore the number 10 shirt , despite playing on the same team . On 17 August 2015 , Maradona visited Ali Bin Nasser , the Tunisian referee of the Argentina–England quarter-final match at the 1986 World Cup where Maradona scored his Hand of God , and paid tribute to him by giving him a signed Argentine jersey . Managerial career Club management Maradona began his managerial career alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield teammate Carlos Fren . The pair led Mandiyú of Corrientes in 1994 and Racing Club in 1995 , with little success . In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates . Maradona was sacked on 10 July 2012 . In August 2013 , Maradona moved on to become mental coach at Argentine club Deportivo Riestra . Maradona departed this role in 2017 to become the head coach of Fujairah , in the UAE second division , before leaving at the end of the season upon failure to secure promotion at the club . In September 2018 he was appointed manager of Mexican second division side Dorados . He made his debut with Dorados on 17 September with a 4–1 victory over Cafetaleros de Tapachula . On 13 June 2019 , after Dorados failed to clinch promotion to the Mexican top flight , Maradona \\'s lawyer announced that he would be stepping down from the role , citing health reasons . On 5 September 2019 , Maradona was unveiled as the new head coach of Gimnasia de La Plata , signing a contract until the end of the season . After two months in charge he left the club on 19 November . However , two days later , Maradona rejoined the club as manager saying that \" we finally achieved political unity in the club \" . Maradona insisted that Gabriel Pellegrino remain club president if he were to stay with Gimnasia de La Plata . However it was still not clear if Pellegrino , who declined to run for re-election , would stay on as club President . Originally scheduled to be held on 23 November , the election was delayed 15 days . On 15 December , Pellegrino , who was encouraged by Maradona to seek re-election , was re-elected to a three-year term . Despite having a bad record during the 2019–20 season , Gimnasia renewed Maradona \\'s contract on 3 June 2020 for the 2020–21 season . International management After the resignation of Argentina national team coach Alfio Basile in 2008 , Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role . According to several press sources , his major challengers included ; Diego Simeone , Carlos Bianchi , Miguel Ángel Russo , and Sergio Batista . On 29 October 2008 , AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national team . On 19 November , Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when they played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow , which Argentina won 1–0 . After winning his first three matches as the coach of the national team , he oversaw a 6–1 defeat to Bolivia , equalling the team \\'s worst ever margin of defeat . With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup , Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify , but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals . After Argentina \\'s qualification , Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference , telling members of the media to \" suck it and keep on sucking it \" . FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity , which expired on 15 January 2010 , and a CHF 25,000 fine , with a warning as to his future conduct . The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the Czech Republic on 15 December , during the period of the ban , was cancelled . The only match Argentina played during Maradona \\'s ban was a friendly away to Catalonia , which they lost 4–2 . At the World Cup finals in June 2010 , Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria , followed by a 4–1 victory over South Korea on the strength of a Gonzalo Higuaín hat-trick . In the final match of the group stage , Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win the group and advance to a second round , meeting Mexico . After defeating Mexico 3–1 , however , Argentina was routed by Germany 4–0 in the quarter-finals to go out of the competition . Argentina was ranked fifth in the tournament . After the defeat to Germany , Maradona admitted that he was reconsidering his future as Argentina \\'s coach , stating , \" I may leave tomorrow . \" On 15 July , the AFA said that he would be offered a new four-year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil staged the World Cup . On 27 July , however , the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract , and instead awarded the job to 1978 World Cup winning captain and his 1986 teammate , Daniel Passarella . Afterwards , on 29 July , Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams ( as well as his former Argentine national team and Sevilla coach ) Carlos Bilardo had \" lied to \" , \" betrayed \" , and effectively sacked him from the role . He said , \" They wanted me to continue , but seven of my staff should not go on , if he told me that , it meant he did not want me to keep working . \" Personal life Family Born to a Roman Catholic family , his parents were Diego Maradona Senior and Dalma Salvadora Franco . Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1989 in Buenos Aires , and they had two daughters , Dalma Nerea ( born 2 April 1987 ) and Gianinna Dinorah ( born 16 May 1989 ) , by whom he became a grandfather in 2009 after she married Sergio Agüero ( now divorced ) . Maradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004 . Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all , as her parents remained on friendly terms . They travelled together to Naples for a series of homages in June 2005 and were seen together on other occasions , including the Argentina games during 2006 World Cup . During the divorce proceedings , Maradona admitted that he was the father of Diego Sinagra ( born in Naples on 20 September 1986 ) . The Italian courts had already ruled so in 1993 , after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests to prove or disprove his paternity . Diego Junior met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing . Sinagra is now a footballer playing in Italy . After the divorce , Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer , and Dalma sought an acting career ; she previously had expressed her desire to attend the Actors Studio in Los Angeles . Maradona \\'s relationship with his immediate family was a close one , and in a 1990 interview with Sports Illustrated he showed phone bills where he had spent a minimum of 15,000 US dollars per month calling his parents and siblings . Maradona \\'s mother , Dalma , died on 19 November 2011 . He was in Dubai at the time , and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her , but was too late . She was 81 years old . His father , \" Don \" Diego , died on 25 June 2015 at age 87 . In 2014 , Maradona was accused of assaulting his girlfriend , Rocío Oliva , allegations which he denied . In 2017 , he gifted her a house in Bella Vista , but in December 2018 they split up . Maradona \\'s great-nephew Hernán López is also a professional footballer . Drug abuse and health problems From the mid-1980s until 2004 , Maradona was addicted to cocaine . He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983 . By the time he was playing for Napoli , he had a full-blown addiction , which interfered with his ability to play football . In the midst of his drug crisis in 1991 , Maradona was asked by journalists if the hit song \" Mi enfermedad \" ( lit . \" My Disease \" ) was dedicated to him . Maradona had a tendency to put on weight and suffered increasingly from obesity , at one point weighing . He was obese from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias , Colombia , on 6 March 2005 . His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return to his normal weight . When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter , he displayed a notably thinner figure . On 29 March 2007 , Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires . He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse and was released on 11 April , but readmitted two days later . In the following days , there were constant rumours about his health , including three false claims of his death within a month . After being transferred to a psychiatric clinic specializing in alcohol-related problems , Maradona was discharged on 7 May . On 8 May , Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years . During the 2018 World Cup match between Argentina and Nigeria , Maradona was shown on television cameras behaving extremely erratically , with an abundance of white residue visible on the glass in front of his seat in the stands . The smudges could have been fingerprints , and he later blamed his behaviour on consuming lots of wine . In January 2019 , Maradona underwent surgery after a hernia caused internal bleeding in his stomach . Political views Maradona showed sympathy to left-wing ideologies . He supported the establishment of an independent Palestinian state and condemned Israel \\'s military strikes on Gaza during the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict , saying : \" What Israel is doing to the Palestinians is shameful . \" He became friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island , with Castro stating , \" Diego is a great friend and very noble , too . There \\'s also no question he ’ s a wonderful athlete and has maintained a friendship with Cuba to no material gain of his own . \" Maradona had a portrait of Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel \\'s second in command , fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm . In his autobiography , El Diego , he dedicated the book to various people , including Castro . He wrote , \" To Fidel Castro and , through him , all the Cuban people . \" Maradona voiced support for Bolivia \\'s ousted president Evo Morales and was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez . In 2005 , he came to Venezuela to meet Chávez , who received him in the Miraflores Palace . After the meeting , Maradona said that he had come to meet a \" great man \" ( un grande , which can also mean \" a big man \" , in Spanish ) , but had instead met a gigantic man ( un gigante ) . He also stated , \" I believe in Chávez , I am a Chavista . Everything Fidel does , everything Chávez does , for me is the best . \" Maradona was Chávez \\'s guest of honour at the opening game of the 2007 Copa América held in Venezuela . In 2004 , he participated in a protest against the U.S.-led war in Iraq . Maradona declared his opposition to what he identified as imperialism , particularly during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata , Argentina . There he protested George W . Bush \\'s presence in Argentina , wearing a T-shirt labelled \" \" ( with the \" s \" in \" Bush \" being replaced with a swastika ) and referring to Bush as \" human garbage \" . In August 2007 , Maradona went further , making an appearance on Chávez \\'s weekly television show Aló Presidente and saying , \" I hate everything that comes from the United States . I hate it with all my strength . \" By December 2008 , however , Maradona had adopted a more pro-U.S . attitude and expressed admiration for Bush \\'s successor , then-President-elect Barack Obama , for whom he had great expectations . With his poor shanty town ( villa miseria ) upbringing , Maradona cultivated a man-of-the-people persona . During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987 , they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity , with Maradona stating , \" I argued with him because I was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids . Sell your ceiling then , amigo , do something ! \" In September 2014 , Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome , crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years away ; he stated , \" We should all imitate Pope Francis . If each one of us gives something to someone else , no one in the world would be starving . \" In December 2007 , Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran : it is displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs \\' museum . In April 2013 , Maradona visited the tomb of Hugo Chávez and urged Venezuelans to elect the late leader \\'s designated successor , Nicolás Maduro , to continue the socialist leader \\'s legacy ; \" Continue the struggle , \" Maradona said on television . Maradona attended Maduro \\'s final campaign rally in Caracas , signing footballs and kicking them to the crowd , and presented Maduro with an Argentina jersey . Having visited Chávez \\'s tomb with Maradona , Maduro said , \" Speaking with Diego was very emotional because comandante Chávez also loved him very much . \" Maradona participated and danced at the electoral campaign rally during the 2018 presidential elections in Venezuela . During the 2019 Venezuelan presidential crisis , the Mexican Football Federation fined him for violating their code of ethics and dedicating a team victory to Nicolás Maduro . Maradona in his 2000 autobiography Yo Soy El Diego , linked the \" Hand of God \" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup to the Falklands War : \" Although we had said before the game that football had nothing to do with the Malvinas [ Falklands ] War , we knew they had killed a lot of Argentine boys there , killed them like little birds . And this was revenge . \" In October 2015 , Maradona thanked Queen Elizabeth II and the Houses of Parliament in London for giving him the chance to provide \" true justice \" as head of an organization designed to help young children . In a video released on his official Facebook page , Maradona confirmed he would accept their nomination for him to become Latin American director for the non-governmental organization Football for Unity . Failure to pay tax In March 2009 , Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government €37 million in local taxes , €23.5 million of which was accrued interest on his original debt . They reported that at that point , Maradona had paid only €42,000 , two luxury watches and a set of earrings . Death On 2 November 2020 , Maradona was admitted to a hospital in La Plata , supposedly for psychological reasons . A representative of the ex-footballer said his condition was not serious .

The same day , a private funeral service was held and Maradona was buried next to his parents at the Jardín de Bella Vista cemetery in Bella Vista , Buenos Aires . Tributes In a statement on social media , the Argentine Football Association expressed \" its deepest sorrow for the death of our legend \" , adding : \" You will always be in our hearts . \" President Alberto Fernández announced three days of national mourning . UEFA and CONMEBOL announced that every match in the Champions League , Europa League , Copa Libertadores , and Copa Sudamericana would hold a moment of silence prior to kickoff . Boca Juniors \\' game was postponed in respect to Maradona . Subsequently , other confederations around the world followed suit , with every fixture observing a minute of silence , starting with the 2020 AFC Champions League \\'s fixtures . In addition to the minute of silence in Serie A , an image of Maradona was projected on stadium screens in the 10th minute of play . In Naples , the Stadio San Paolo—officially renamed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona on 4 December 2020—was illuminated at night in honour of Maradona , with numerous fans gathering outside the stadium placing murals and paintings as a tribute . Both Napoli owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and the mayor of Naples Luigi de Magistris expressed their desire to rename their stadium after Maradona , which was unanimously approved by Naples City Council . Prior to Napoli \\'s Europa League match against Rijeka the day after Maradona \\'s death , all of the Napoli players wore shirts with \" Maradona 10 \" on the back of them , before observing a minute of silence . Figures in the sport from every continent around the world also paid tribute to him . Celebrities and other sports people outside football also paid tribute to Maradona . On 27 November 2020 , the Aditya School of Sports in Barasat , Kolkata , India named their cricket stadium after Maradona . Three years earlier Maradona had conducted a workshop with 100 kids in the stadium and played a charity match at the same venue with former Indian cricket captain , Sourav Ganguly . The AFA announced that the 2020 Copa de la Liga Profesional , which is the debut season of Copa de la Liga Profesional , would be renamed Copa Diego Armando Maradona .

On 30 November , after Boca Juniors opened the scoring against Newell \\'s Old Boys at La Bombonera , the club \\'s players paid an emotional tribute by laying a Maradona jersey in front of his private suite where his daughter Dalma was present . Aftermath In May 2021 , seven medical professionals were charged with homicide over Maradona \\'s death as they violated their duties , and could face between 8 and 25 years in prison if convicted . On 25 June , psychiatrist Agustina Cosachov was summoned by the Prosecution Office of San Isidro and faced a formal questioning , where she accepted to answer more than 100 queries regarding the medical treatment given to Maradona in that medical field . After seven hours of questioning , Cosachov \\'s lawyer Vadim Mischanchuk addressed the press and denied that Cosachov \\'s prescription medication could have worsened Maradona \\'s heart condition , and Cosachov further denied any responsibility in the death . On 28 June , multiple arrest warrants were requested by a plaintiff lawyer against Cosachov , personal doctor Leopoldo Luque , psychologist Carlos Díaz , and doctor Nancy Forlini in direct connection with Maradona \\'s alleged negligent death . On 1 July , the prosecutors in the case rejected to ask a judge to issue the arrest warrants against all the aforementioned professionals on the basis that they considered the request had been a \" mediatic stunt \" for the case and added that the requester of the arrest warrants wanted a \" TV show stunt \" in consideration of the timing with personal doctor Luque \\'s interrogation . In popular culture The American newspaper Houston Chronicle wrote of Maradona : In Argentina , Maradona is considered an icon . Concerning the idolatry that exists in his country , former teammate Jorge Valdano said , \" At the time that Maradona retired from active football , he left Argentina traumatized . Maradona was more than just a great footballer . He was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived through several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds . \" Valdano added that \" Maradona offered to Argentines a way out of their collective frustration , and that \\'s why people there love him as a divine figure . \" In leading his nation to the 1986 World Cup , and in particular his performance and two goals in the quarter-final against England , Guillem Balagué writes : \" That Sunday in Mexico City , the world saw one man single-handedly – in more than one sense of the phrase – lift the mood of a depressed and downtrodden nation into the stratosphere . With two goals in the space of four minutes , he allowed them to dare to dream that they , like him , could be the best in the world . He did it first by nefarious and then spellbindingly brilliant means . In those moments , he went from star player to legend . \" Since 1986 , it has been common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona \\'s name as a token of recognition , even in remote places . The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England . In Argentina , Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends . In the Argentine film El hijo de la novia ( \" Son of the Bride \" ) , somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron , \" They idolized him and then crucified him . \" When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far , the fake priest retorts , \" But I was talking about Maradona . \" He is the subject of the film El camino de San Diego , though he himself only appears in archive footage . Maradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book El Cazador de Aventuras . After the closing of it , the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled El Die , using Maradona as the main character . Maradona has had several online Flash games that are entirely dedicated to his legacy . In Rosario , Argentina , locals organized the parody religion of the \" Church of Maradona \" . The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition , such as Christmas or prayers , reflecting instead details from Maradona . It had 200 founding members , and tens of thousands more have become members via the church \\'s official web site . Many Argentine artists performed songs in tribute to Diego , such as \" La Mano de Dios \" by El Potro Rodrigo , \" Maradona \" by Andrés Calamaro , \" Para siempre Diego \" ( Diego Forever ) by Los Ratones Paranoicos , \" Francotirador \" ( Sniper ) by Attaque 77 , \" Maradona Blues \" by Charly García , \" Santa Maradona \" ( Saint Maradona ) by Mano Negra , and \" La Vida Tómbola \" by Manu Chao , among others . There are also other films , such as : Maradona , La Mano de Dios ( Maradona , the Hand of God ) , Amando a Maradona ( Loving Maradona ) , and Maradona by Kusturica . By 1982 , Maradona had become one of the biggest sports stars in the world and had endorsements with many companies , including Puma and Coca-Cola , earning him an additional $ 1.5 million per year on top of his club salary . In 1982 , he featured in a World Cup commercial for Coca-Cola , and a Japanese commercial for Puma . In 1984 he earned $ 7m a year at Napoli , and sponsorships included $ 5m from Hitachi . In 1984 , a poll from IMG named Maradona the best known person in the world . In 2010 he appeared in a commercial for French fashion house Louis Vuitton , indulging in a game of table football with fellow World Cup winners Pelé and Zinedine Zidane . Maradona featured in the music video to the 2010 World Cup song \" Waka Waka \" by Shakira , with footage shown of him celebrating Argentina winning the 1986 World Cup . A 2006 television commercial for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazil national team , including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian players Ronaldo and Kaká . Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having too much of the drink . This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release ( although the commercial was not supposed to air for the Argentine market , fans could see it online ) . Maradona replied that he had no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football , but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate , Boca Juniors \\' traditional rival . There is a documented phenomenon of Brazilians being named in honour of Maradona , an example being footballer Diego Costa . In 2017 , Maradona featured as a legendary player in the football video games FIFA 18 and Pro Evolution Soccer 2018 . In 2019 , a documentary film titled Diego Maradona was released by Academy Award and BAFTA Award winning filmmaker Asif Kapadia , director of Amy ( on singer Amy Winehouse ) and Senna ( on motor racing driver Ayrton Senna ) . Kapadia stated that \" ... Maradona is the third part of a trilogy about child geniuses and fame . \" He added , \" ... I was fascinated by his journey , wherever he went there were moments of incredible brilliance and drama . He was a leader , taking his teams to the very top , but also many lows in his career . He was always the little guy fighting against the system ... and he was willing to do anything , to use all of his cunning and intelligence to win . \" Career statistics Maradona made 694 appearances and scored 354 goals for club and country combined , with a goalscoring average of .

Rijkaard played for Ajax , Real Zaragoza and AC Milan and represented the Netherlands national team side 73 times , scoring 10 goals . In his managerial career , he was at the helm of the Netherlands national team , Sparta Rotterdam , Barcelona , Galatasaray and the Saudi Arabia national team . Regarded as one of the best midfielders in footballing history , Rijkaard was described by British broadsheet The Daily Telegraph as having been \" a stylish player of faultless pedigree \" . Playing career Ajax Rijkaard was born in Amsterdam . His mother Neel is Dutch and his father Herman ( 1935–2010 ) was a Surinamese footballer who arrived in the Netherlands along with the father of Ruud Gullit ; the two sons grew up playing together in the city . Rijkaard was just 17 when Ajax coach Leo Beenhakker gave him his senior squad debut on 23 August 1980 . He made an immediate impact , scoring the third goal in a 4–2 away victory over Go Ahead Eagles , the first league match in the 1980–81 season . He would play another 23 games for Ajax in his first season , netting four goals . In 1981–82 , he won his first league championship with Ajax and went on to successfully defend the title the following season . Rijkaard stayed at Ajax for seven-and-a-half seasons . During this period , he won the Dutch league championship three times ( 1981–82 , 1982–83 , 1984–85 ) and the Dutch Cup three times ( 1982–83 , 1985–86 , 1986–87 ) . In the 1986–87 season , he won the Cup Winners \\' Cup with Ajax over Lokomotiv Leipzig , winning 1–0 . In September 1987 , what would have been Rijkaard \\'s third season ( 1987–88 ) under Dutchman Johan Cruyff as head coach , Rijkaard stormed off the training field and vowed never to play under him again . He was subsequently signed by Sporting CP , but he signed too late to be eligible to play in any competition . He was immediately loaned out to Real Zaragoza , but upon completing his first season at Zaragoza was signed by AC Milan . AC Milan Rijkaard played for five seasons at Milan . It was coach Arrigo Sacchi who saw Rijkaard as playing a pivotal role at Milan and transformed the central defender into a world class holding midfielder , where the Dutchman \\'s aggressive and firm style would go on to influence the likes of Patrick Vieira to replicate in future years . Playing alongside fellow country-men Marco van Basten and Ruud Gullit , Rijkaard won the European Cup twice ( in 1989 against Steaua București and 1990 , against Benfica ) and the domestic Serie A championship twice . In the 1990 European Cup Final , he scored the only goal to win the cup for Milan . Return to Ajax After five seasons in Italy , Rijkaard returned to Ajax in 1993 . With Louis van Gaal at the helm , Rijkaard and Danny Blind formed the experienced defensive core of the Ajax team that won the first two of three consecutive Dutch championships . Ajax were the unbeaten champions of the Netherlands in the 1994–95 season , and carried that success into Europe . In his final game , Rijkaard won the Champions League with a 1–0 victory over Milan in the 1995 final at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion in Vienna . He was named in the FIFA 100 , Pelé \\'s list of the 125 World \\'s Greatest Footballers . International career On the international stage , Rijkaard made his debut for the Netherlands in 1981 . He was part of the Dutch side that won UEFA Euro 1988 with a 2–0 win in the final over the Soviet Union , playing at centre-back alongside Ronald Koeman . He won a total of 73 caps and scored 10 goals . Rijkaard also played for the Netherlands during the 1990 and 1994 FIFA World Cups and at Euro 1992 . At Euro 1992 , Rijkaard scored a late equalizer for the Netherlands in a 2–2 draw with Denmark at the semi-final stage but the Dutch went out on penalties . He made his final appearance for the Netherlands in the 3–2 defeat against eventual winners Brazil in the quarter-finals of the 1994 World Cup . Spitting incident Rijkaard was the cause of an incident with Rudi Völler when West Germany played the Netherlands in the 1990 World Cup . Rijkaard was booked for a tackle on Völler and , as Rijkaard took up position for the free kick , he spat in Völler \\'s hair . Völler complained to the referee and was booked as well . From the resulting free kick , Völler then handled the ball and then went to the ground ( according to his own account ) to avoid a collision with Dutch keeper Hans van Breukelen , while others , notably Rijkaard and van Breukelen , saw Voller \\'s handball and his resulting action as a dive in hopes for a penalty . Van Breukelen was angry at this but Rijkaard , already annoyed by Völler \\'s previous antics , again confronted the West German by twisting his ear and stamping on his foot . Argentine referee Juan Carlos Loustau was tired of both Völler and Rijkaard \\'s consistently hostile antics towards each other in such a short period of time , and fearing a fight between the two , sent off both Rijkaard and Völler . As he jogged back to the entrance tunnel , Rijkaard again spat in Völler \\'s hair as they left the pitch . The German press nicknamed him \" Llama \" for his spitting . Rijkaard would later apologise for his behaviour to Völler , who accepted . Style of play Regarded as one of the greatest players in his position , Rijkaard was a quick , strong , complete and tenacious defensive midfielder who was praised by pundits throughout his career for his physical and athletic attributes , his work rate , positioning , his acute tactical intelligence and decision-making , as well as his outstanding consistency and ability to read the game . Due to his aggression and versatility , he was also capable of playing as a central or box-to-box midfielder , and even in a defensive role , usually in the centre . Although Rijkaard was known as strong tackler , he was surprisingly elegant for a player of his size , and also possessed good technique , passing ability , link-up play , and vision , which made him adept at starting attacking plays as a deep-lying playmaker once he won back possession ; because of his technical skills and creative abilities , he was also capable of playing in more advanced roles , as an attacking midfielder or second striker . Due to his height and physical strength , he excelled in the air , and also possessed a powerful shot ; furthermore , he was capable of getting forward and contributing to his team \\'s attacking plays with goals by making late runs into the penalty area . Managerial career Early years Rijkaard \\'s coaching career began when he was appointed manager of the Netherlands national team in 1998 . He had previously served as an assistant coach , along with Johan Neeskens and Ronald Koeman under the managerial tenure of Guus Hiddink . At the time , he was not taken seriously as a manager because of his inexperience , but he was able to guide his national side to the semi-finals of Euro 2000 . During the group phase , the Dutch team won slowly but surely and managed to get three victories : 1–0 against the Czech Republic , 3–0 against Denmark and 3–2 against France . In the quarter-final , his side produced the biggest win of the competition , a 6–1 result against Yugoslavia . The Netherlands played some of the best football of the tournament , but lost their semi-final match to Italy on penalties ; Rijkaard resigned immediately . During the 2001–02 season , he became manager of Sparta Rotterdam in the Eredivisie , the oldest professional team in the country . Rijkaard enjoyed the down-to-earth atmosphere , although the club was not financially strong . Under his leadership , the club was relegated to the second division for the first time in its history , and he was consequently sacked . Barcelona First years Rijkaard was not out of a coaching role for long , and less than a year after leaving Sparta , he was appointed manager of Barcelona for the 2003–04 season , with Albert Roca as the assistant coach . The season would prove to be a watershed for the club , but not without initial instability . Rijkaard arrived at the club as it entered a new phase , having elected a new president in Joan Laporta and a new managerial board , but with fans unhappy that Laporta had let English midfielder David Beckham snub the chance to join the club . For Rijkaard , the team he inherited , with the exception of new superstar signing Ronaldinho ( who was the club \\'s second choice after Beckham ) , also consisted of many underachieving players from the old guard and era that failed to meet the club and its fans \\' demands to match archrival Real Madrid \\'s success in the early 2000s , having not won a trophy since 1999 . Rijkaard had a disappointing start at Barcelona that saw some sections of the club \\'s fans call for his resignation , and he drew flak from the media when the team lost to Real Madrid in December 2003 . Rijkaard \\'s resilience won through and from 2004 onwards , he achieved a massive turnaround , as the team went from strength to strength . Barcelona finished runners-up in La Liga in 2003–04 , having been close to the relegation zone at one point in the earlier stages of the season . Rijkaard then took Barcelona to the next level as he phased out the old guard and rebuilt a new-look side around Ronaldinho , with new players like Deco , Samuel Eto \\' o , Rafael Márquez and Ludovic Giuly , along with the latest promotion of some young players from the previous era trained in the club \\'s youth teams , including Víctor Valdés , Lionel Messi and Andrés Iniesta . He eventually succeeded in turning around the fortunes of the club , with the strong support of Laporta , and within the next couple of years finally managed to win La Liga both in 2004–05 and in 2005–06 . Champions League title and after Rijkaard became the first Barcelona coach to have won twice at Real Madrid \\'s Santiago Bernabéu Stadium , an achievement which even successful managers like Johan Cruyff , Louis van Gaal and Luis Aragonés were unable to accomplish . His no-nonsense policy on and off the field , and the sparkling football played by his team , won him many plaudits and Rijkaard was among the five nominated coaches for UEFA \\'s Team of the Year 2005 . On 8 March 2006 , he was also honoured by UEFA for his contributions to the European Cup competition throughout his career as player and manager . Rijkaard also achieved success on the European stage , winning the 2005–06 Champions League with a 2–1 win against Arsenal in the final . Barcelona had been losing 1–0 for most of the match before his late tactical substitutions proved the decisive factor , as the introduction of Henrik Larsson and Juliano Belletti contributed directly to Barcelona \\'s two goals . The win made him the fifth individual to have won the European Cup both as a player and as a manager , alongside Miguel Muñoz , Giovanni Trapattoni , Johan Cruyff and Carlo Ancelotti , a feat later achieved also by his eventual successor , Pep Guardiola and then Zinedine Zidane . After losing to Manchester United in the semi-final of the 2007–08 Champions League , Rijkaard was asked whether he would quit at the end of the season , since he had not won anything for two successive seasons . He replied , \" I have no intention of leaving . It would be different if the players were saying it is time for me to go but that is not the case . \" On 1 May 2008 , it was reported that Rijkaard allegedly confided to a colleague that he would be stepping down as Barcelona manager at the end of the season , but 24 hours later , he stated in a press conference that he had no intention of leaving the club . On 8 May 2008 , the day after Barcelona \\'s dismal 4–1 defeat to archrivals Real Madrid , Barcelona president Joan Laporta announced that at the end of the 2007–08 season , Rijkaard would no longer be head coach of the first team . Laporta made the announcement after a board meeting , and Rijkaard was succeeded by Pep Guardiola . Laporta made it clear that Rijkaard \\'s achievements \" made history \" and praised him for his time at the club . Galatasaray On 5 June 2009 , Rijkaard signed a two-year contract to manage the Turkish Süper Lig team Galatasaray , following the resignation of Bülent Korkmaz two days earlier . He was sacked on 19 October 2010 and was replaced with Gheorghe Hagi . Saudi Arabia On 28 June 2011 , it was announced that Rijkaard would be head coach of the Saudi Arabia national team after a deal was reached with the Saudi Arabia Football Federation . Saudi Arabia were eliminated in the third round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification after a 4–2 away defeat to Australia in their last match on 29 February , finishing third in their group . The 21st Arabian Gulf Cup was the second competition for Rijkaard with Saudi Arabia . The Saudis left the competition at the group stage after losing 2–0 against Iraq , a 2–0 win against Yemen and 1–0 defeat against Kuwait . On 16 January 2013 , Rijkaard was dismissed under a confidential contractual termination penalty clause following Saudi Arabia \\'s exit at the tournament . Later career In 2013 , Florida prep school Montverde Academy hired Rijkaard as their advisor of player development . In December 2016 , Rijkaard announced he would no longer pursue a position as manager . Coaching philosophy and style As a coach , Rijkaard \\'s essential philosophy is to guide his team towards playing attack-minded football as a cohesive unit . In doing this , he believes a team can achieve the dual objectives of winning games and ensuring the audience \\'s enjoyment of the spectacle . This follows in the best coaching traditions of Rijkaard \\'s countrymen and forebears Rinus Michels and Johan Cruyff . In this light , it is notable that Michels coached both Cruyff and Rijkaard during their respective participations with the Dutch national team , and that Cruyff himself went on to coach Rijkaard . Nonetheless , Rijkaard believes in working within a contemporary football context and is not out to imitate the styles and tactics of past masters . In his own words : Rijkaard has evidently learned to curb the quick temper of his playing days and is often a portrait of calm and stability in training and along the touchline . He rarely courts controversy in the media and is more apt now to promote a positive environment and let his team \\'s play speak for itself when faced with intense rivalry or criticism . The tactics used during his tenure as manager of Barcelona best exemplify Rijkaard \\'s commitment to playing stylish attacking football . During the team \\'s 2004–05 and 2005–06 campaigns , the coach frequently fielded a 4–3–3 formation , a system which encouraged the flair and creativity of the players in the front third of the field and created optimal interplay between the midfielders and forwards during attacks , with Ronaldinho being the focal point of the team \\'s offence . Within this system , the four defenders also tended to play in a relatively high position on the pitch to support the midfield , which frequently advanced to participate in the attack . The team generally focuses on maintaining possession in the opponents \\' half of the field , applying pressure in order to force the opposition to make errors in defense and offensive counter-attacking . Personal life Rijkaard comes from a football-playing family . He is the son of Herman Rijkaard , a former footballer who played for SV Robinhood in the Surinamese Hoofdklasse , before emigrating to the Netherlands , where he played in the Dutch Eredivisie for FC Blauw-Wit . His older brother , Herman Rijkaard , Jr. , is a FIFA certified players \\' agent who represents various players internationally . Twice divorced , he is currently married to Stephanie and has four children . Media Rijkaard features in EA Sports \\' FIFA video game series ; he was featured in the FIFA 14 , FIFA 15 , FIFA 16 and FIFA 17 Ultimate Team Legends . For FIFA 18 , FIFA 19 , FIFA 20 , FIFA 21 and FIFA 22 , he appeared as an ICON player in FIFA Ultimate Team ( FUT ) .

They compete in Ligue 1 , the top division of French football . France \\'s most successful club , they have won over 40 official honours , including nine league titles and one major European trophy . Their home ground is the Parc des Princes . PSG were founded in 1970 , following the merger of Paris FC and Stade Saint-Germain . The Parisians won their first major honour , the French Cup , in 1982 and their first Division 1 title in 1986 . The 1990s was among the most successful periods in PSG \\'s history ; they claimed a second league title , three French Cups , two French League Cups , two French Super Cups and the UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup in 1996 . After suffering a decline in fortunes during the 2000s , the Red and Blues have enjoyed a revival since 2011 with increased financial backing , achieving unparalleled dominance in domestic competitions , winning seven league titles and twenty national cups . PSG have also become a regular feature in the UEFA Champions League , reaching their first final in 2020 . Paris SG have the most consecutive seasons playing in France \\'s top flight and are one of two French clubs to have won a major European title . They are the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world . PSG \\'s home kit colours are red , blue , and white , and their crest features the Eiffel Tower and a fleur-de-lis . PSG have a longstanding rivalry with Olympique de Marseille ; the duo contest French football \\'s most notorious match , Le Classique . Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , the Emir of Qatar , owns PSG through closed shareholders Qatar Sports Investments ( QSI ) , which purchased the club in 2011 . The takeover made PSG the richest club in France and one of the wealthiest in the world . As of the 2019–20 season , PSG have the seventh-highest revenue in the footballing world with an annual revenue of €541m according to Deloitte , and are the world \\'s ninth-most valuable football club , worth $ 2.5bn according to Forbes . History Creation and split ( 1970–1974 ) In the summer of 1970 , an ambitious group of businessmen decided to create a major team in the French capital . Guy Crescent and Pierre-Étienne Guyot chose to merge their newly formed side , Paris Football Club , with Stade Saint-Germain of Henri Patrelle after the team from Saint-Germain-en-Laye , 15km west of Paris , were promoted to Ligue 2 . Real Madrid played a big role in the foundation of Paris Saint-Germain . The three men were stuck with the financial feasibility of the project until they met Real \\'s president Santiago Bernabéu . Bernabéu told them that starting a crowdfunding campaign was the best solution to establish a new team . After a petition was signed by 20,000 people , Paris Saint-Germain Football Club were officially formed on 12 August 1970 . For the first time in French football history , the fans had financially contributed in the making of a football club . The new capital club built a substantial fanbase thanks to the merger and benefited hugely from an improved squad . Led by Jean Djorkaeff , the club \\'s first star , PSG won promotion to Division 1 and claimed the 1970–71 French Division 2 title in its first season . Following a delicate financial situation , the Paris City Council offered to pay the club \\'s debt and in return demanded them to adopt the more Parisian name of \" Paris Football Club . \" After PSG president Henri Patrelle refused the name change and financial support was withdrawn , the club split in 1972 . Paris FC remained in the top tier , while PSG were administratively relegated to Division 3 . First major honours and decline ( 1974–1991 ) PSG took flight when fashion designer Daniel Hechter took over . Shortly before the start of the 1973–74 campaign , he replaced Henri Patrelle as president and named Francis Borelli as vice-president . Besides offering his financial support to the club , Hechter also designed PSG \\'s classic home outfit . Following back-to-back promotions , under French legend Just Fontaine , Paris Saint-Germain quickly returned to the premier division in 1974 , ironically at the same time as Paris FC slipped into the division below , and moved into the Parc des Princes , which up until that point had been the home stadium of PFC . Since then , PSG have never abandoned the top flight of French football nor the Parc . Before that , PSG had been playing at several grounds including the Stade Municipal Georges Lefèvre , the Stade Jean-Bouin , the Stade Bauer , and even the Parc des Princes a few times that season despite the reluctance of PFC . Chaired by Daniel Hechter , the Parisians failed to win any silverware in the 1970s but began their tradition of brilliant Coupe de France runs , established themselves as a top-half team in Division 1 and attracted several prestigious players , including Jean-Pierre Dogliani , Mustapha Dahleb and Carlos Bianchi . After Hechter was banned for life from football by the French Football Federation in January 1978 , for running a corruption scheme involving ticket sales at Parc des Princes , Francis Borelli , who had been vice-president until then , became the new boss of the Île-de-France club . The club \\'s trophy cabinet welcomed its first major silverware with the help of star signings Joël Bats , Dominique Bathenay , Safet Sušić and Dominique Rocheteau , alongside PSG Academy graduate Luis Fernandez , who steered the capital side to two consecutive French Cup titles in 1982 and 1983 . These successes opened Paris the doors to Europe , including their impressive continental debut in the 1982–83 European Cup Winners \\' Cup , which saw them reach the quarter-finals of the tournament . PSG won its maiden league championship in 1986 . Led by Sušić Joël Bats , Luis Fernández and Dominique Rocheteau , the Red and Blues dominated the championship from start to finish , going a memorable 26 matches without defeat towards the title . The follow-up to the league title was not as glorious though . PSG finished seventh in the 1986–87 French Division 1 and their first UEFA Champions League appearance that season was a complete failure . They were knocked out by minnows Vítkovice in the first round of the 1986–87 European Cup . The following year , PSG avoided relegation on the final match of the 1987–88 season after a 4–1 win over Lens at the Parc des Princes . Highly indebted , the club briefly bounced back , fighting for the 1988–89 league crown with Marseille , before going into decline . Canal+ takeover and golden era ( 1991–1998 ) The takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised Paris Saint-Germain as they became one of the richest clubs in France . Canal+ wiped out PSG \\'s huge debt and appointed Michel Denisot , journalist on the channel , as club president in place of Francis Borelli . Now enjoying serious investment , the Red and Blues were able to set their sights steadily higher : they had to qualify for European competitions in their first season and become French champions within three years . In consequence , Canal+ increased the club \\'s budget from 90 to 120 million francs in order to build a strong squad for the 1991–92 season . The revolution began with the appointment of renowned coach Artur Jorge , famous for leading Porto to the 1986–87 European Cup trophy . The club then embarked on a spending spree , signing Brazilian stars Ricardo and Valdo as well as proven French players Paul Le Guen , Laurent Fournier , Patrick Colleter and prolific Liberian striker George Weah . The 1992–93 season also marked the beginning of Le Classique , the rivalry between Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille , as both teams battled each other on the field for the 1992–93 French Division 1 crown . PSG finished runners-up after losing both games against Marseille . In the second match between the two clubs , only three days after winning the 1992–93 UEFA Champions League , league leaders Marseille welcomed closest challengers PSG in a match that would determine the title . After Marseille won their fifth consecutive championship , Bernard Tapie and Marseille were found guilty of match-fixing in what became known as the French football bribery scandal . The French Football Federation stripped Marseille of their title and offered it to second-placed PSG , who refused it because club owners Canal+ thought that claiming the trophy would anger their subscribers back in Marseille . As a result , the 1992–93 title remained unattributed , with Canal+ even refused letting the capital club participate in next year \\'s Champions League after UEFA excluded Marseille from the competition . Instead , Monaco , who finish third in Ligue 1 took the Champions League spot instead . Considered the club \\'s golden era , the Parisians won nine trophies and reached five consecutive European semi-finals during the 1990s , including their first UEFA Champions League last-four appearance and two at the same stage of the UEFA Cup . PSG \\'s crowning glory came in the 1996 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup Final with legend Luis Fernandez now as coach . Bruno Ngotty scored the only goal of the match to defeat Rapid Wien and make Paris the second French club to ever clinch a major European tournament and the youngest club in history to win a European title at 24 years of existence . The following season , PSG finished runners-up in the 1996 UEFA Super Cup and 1997 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup Final . On the domestic scene , results were just as satisfying , with Paris celebrating a second league title , three French Cups , two French League Cups and just as many French Super Cup wins . Crisis mode and relegation battles ( 1998–2011 ) PSG then went into decline following years of mismanagement . In the summer 1999 , PSG spent heavily on new players signing Nicolas Anelka , Peter Luccin and Stéphane Dalmat as part of the \" PSG Banlieue \" project of its shareholder Canal+ , with the goal of winning Ligue 1 and performing a solid UEFA Champions League campaign . In 2002 , the club faced a massive financial loss with a deficit of €65 million , leading Canal+ to fire Luis Fernandez as coach and Laurent Perpère as president and replacing them with Vahid Halilhodžić , who became the new coach and Francis Graille the new president . The club \\'s form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and eventually , a split from owners Canal+ became inevitable . At the start of the 21st century , PSG struggled to rescale the heights despite the magic of Ronaldinho and the goals of Pauleta . Five more trophies arrived in the form of three French Cups ( including one against Le Classique arch-rivals Marseille in 2006 ) , one French League Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup , but the club became better known for lurching from one high-profile crisis to another . Following years of mismanagement , the club \\'s form dwindled as they slipped further down the table and a split from Canal+ became inevitable . The French premium television channel sold the club to Colony Capital in 2006 . The situation , however , only got worse and PSG spent the 2006–07 and 2007–08 campaigns staving off relegations . The latter was the most dramatic . Marred by poor results and fan violence , Paris avoided the drop on the final match after a 2–1 win at Sochaux . The hero was Ivorian striker Amara Diané who scored both goals that night . Despite not enjoying the star status of other current or past PSG greats , Diané is still considered a legend by most Parisian fans . QSI ownership and domestic hegemony ( 2011–present ) After two years of solid progress and stability under the stewardship of manager Antoine Kombouaré and president Robin Leproux , the fortunes of Paris Saint-Germain changed dramatically when Qatar Sports Investments ( QSI ) purchased the club in 2011 . The takeover made PSG not only the richest club in France but one of the wealthiest in the world . Club president Nasser Al-Khelaifi pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France \\'s biggest name . Club legend Leonardo was brought back in a sporting director capacity and oversaw a spending spree in summer 2011 that has so far been unprecedented in Ligue 1 history , including the signings of Blaise Matuidi , Salvatore Sirigu , Maxwell , Kevin Gameiro and Javier Pastore . As a result , the Parisians have dominated French football , despite finishing behind Montpellier in 2011–12 , the elusive league crown was finally brought back to Paris in 2012–13 driven by star player Zlatan Ibrahimović , team captain Thiago Silva and famous manager Carlo Ancelotti . During the season , ahead of the winter transfer deadline it was announced that David Beckham signed a five-month deal with the club . Zlatan \\'s 30-goal haul almost single-handedly led the capital side to its first Ligue 1 title in 19 years , and third overall . They also became a regular in the knockout stages of the Champions League , being eliminated from the UEFA Champions League on away goals by Barcelona in the quarter-finals after drawing both games . Big money signings continued with the arrivals of Edinson Cavani in 2013 for a league record of €64 million , making it the sixth largest transfer in history and David Luiz in 2014 for a £50 million transfer fee , a world-record transfer for a defender . Despite the departure of Carlo Ancelotti , PSG kept its winning ways under Laurent Blanc . The club secured a maiden domestic treble ( Ligue 1 , Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions ) in the 2013–14 season , before claiming an unprecedented national quadruple ( Ligue 1 , Coupe de France , Coupe de la Ligue and Trophée des Champions ) twice in a row in 2014–15 and 2015–16 , winning the latter with a record-breaking 96 points , becoming the only first French men \\'s team to achieve that feat . Fresh from three consecutive UEFA Europa League titles with Sevilla , Unai Emery was hired by PSG for his European pedigree . But with star player Zlatan Ibrahimović gone , the club endured a disappointing 2016–17 season . Paris were pipped to the Ligue 1 title by Monaco , missing out on top spot for the first time in five years . Meanwhile , in the UEFA Champions League , the club suffered several disappointing nights , including arguably the club \\'s most painful continental defeat in the infamous and controversial \" La Remontada \" ( \" The Comeback \" ) against Barcelona , losing 6–1 in the second leg of the round of sixteen , despite winning the first leg in France by a score of 4–0 . In response , PSG signed Neymar Jr . for a world-record fee of €222 million , making him the most expensive player ever and French prodigy Kylian Mbappé on an initial loan , which was made permanent in 2018 in a transfer worth €180 million plus add ons , making him both the second-most expensive player and most expensive teenager , assembling a fearsome attacking trio alongside Edinson Cavani . The capital club reclaimed the Ligue 1 title and also won the Trophée des Champions , the Coupe de la Ligue and the Coupe de France , clinching the domestic quadruple for the third time in four seasons . Despite their massive expenditure , in the Champions League , PSG lost to Real Madrid in the round of 16 , leading manager Unai Emery to leave the club at the end of the season . In May 2018 , Thomas Tuchel signed a two-year contract with PSG , replacing Unai Emery . Paris Saint-Germain again fell in the Champions League round of 16 in 2018–19 , suffering a shock 3–1 defeat at home to Manchester United after winning the first leg 2–0 at Old Trafford . This season , they also won the Ligue 1 for the 8th time in their history , but lost in the Coupe de France final against Rennes . PSG were eliminated from the Coupe de la Ligue in embarrassing fashion , as they lost 2–1 at home to Guingamp in the quarterfinals . In 2019–20 , PSG won the Ligue 1 for the 9th time in their history , despite the season ending prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic , and also reclaimed the Coupe de France defeating Saint-Étienne in the final and won the last-ever Coupe de la Ligue defeating Lyon in a penalty shootout . In the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League , PSG reached the semi-finals for the second time since 1995 , after a last minute 2–1 win over Atalanta , before losing to Bayern Munich 1–0 in the finals in Lisbon , with former PSG player Kingsley Coman scoring the winning goal . Tuchel \\'s tenure at Paris Saint-Germain was marred by a fractured relationship with the club \\'s hierarchy , leading him to be dismissed on 24 December , despite placing top of their Champions League group . On 2 January 2021 , former PSG player Mauricio Pochettino was appointed as the new head coach . PSG \\'s good form in the Champions League continued in 2021 with a second consecutive UCL semi-final appearance , a first for the club . Domestically , PSG won the Coupe de France , but failed to retain the Ligue 1 title , finishing one point behind Lille , losing the league for the second time in four years . In July , PSG completed one of the most historic transfer windows in football history , exercising the option to buy on Danilo Pereira and signing Achraf Hakimi from Inter Milan for a reported fee of €60 million , Georginio Wijnaldum , legendary Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos and Euro 2020 \\'s player of the tournament Gianluigi Donnarumma on free transfers . PSG concluded their transfer window with the signing of one of the greatest players of all time and record Ballon d\\'Or winner Lionel Messi , who unexpectedly left Barcelona following the expiration of his contract , and promising defender Nuno Mendes on a season-long loan with an option to buy . Identity Colours and mascot Since their foundation , Paris Saint-Germain have represented both the city of Paris and the nearby royal town of Saint-Germain-en-Laye . As a result , red , blue and white are the club \\'s traditional colours . The red and blue are Parisian colours , a nod to revolutionary figures Lafayette and Jean Sylvain Bailly , and the white is a symbol of French royalty and Saint-Germain-en-Laye . On the club \\'s crest , the Eiffel Tower in red and the blue background represent Paris , while the fleur de lys in white is a hint to the coat of arms of Saint-Germain-en-Laye . The fleur de lys is a royal symbol as well and recalls that French King Louis XIV was born in the town . Throughout its history , PSG have brandished several crests , but all of them have featured the club \\'s three historical colours . Likewise , PSG \\'s most iconic shirts have been predominantly red , blue or white , with the remaining two colours included as well . The club \\'s official mascot , Germain the Lynx , also sports PSG \\'s traditional colours . It was unveiled during the 2010 Tournoi de Paris in commemoration of the club \\'s 40th anniversary , and can be seen entertaining kids in the stands of the Parc des Princes or near the pitch with the players during the warm-up . Anthems and mottos \" Allez Paris ! , \" recorded by Belgian actress and singer Annie Cordy in 1971 , was the club \\'s first official anthem . A PSG fan from the start , she was part of an association of hundreds of celebrities who contributed to the club \\'s foundation in 1970 . The club \\'s second anthem , \" Allez Paris-Saint-Germain ! \" by Les Parisiens , was recorded in 1977 , replacing Cordy \\'s version . An initiative of historical PSG leader and music producer Charles Talar , he produced and released it under his homonym record label . The song \\'s chorus became a popular chant among PSG supporters during games . A new version , also called \" Allez Paris-Saint-Germain ! , \" was recorded in 2010 as part of the club \\'s 40th anniversary celebrations . Sung to the tune of \" Go West \" by Village People , the lyrics were rewritten with suggestions made by fans . This is the club \\'s current official anthem . \" Ô Ville Lumière \" ( \" Oh City of Light \" ) , to the tune of \" Flower of Scotland , \" is another veritable club anthem for PSG supporters . Other notable chants from supporters \\' groups in the Boulogne and Auteuil stands include \" Le Parc est à nous \" ( \" The Parc is ours \" ) , \" Paris est magique ! \" ( \" Paris is magical ! \" ) and \" Ici , c\\'est Paris ! \" ( \" This is Paris ! \" ) . Both stands began exchanging these chants during PSG matches in the 1990s . \" Paris est magique ! \" and \" Ici c\\'est Paris ! \" are also the club \\'s most iconic mottos or slogans . \" Who Said I Would \" by Phill Collins is also a traditional anthem for the fans . The song has accompanied the players \\' entry into the field since 1992 . Iconic shirts During their first three seasons of existence , the home shirt of Paris Saint-Germain was red with blue and white details in its sleeves and neck to bring together the three colours of the club : the red and blue of Paris , and the white of Saint-Germain-en-Laye . During the 2010–11 season , PSG wore a red shirt during home matches to commemorate their 40th anniversary . The connection between Paris Saint-Germain and the city \\'s fashion houses is a longstanding one . French fashion designer Daniel Hechter became PSG president in 1973 and designed the club \\'s traditional home look that same year : a blue shirt with a red vertical stripe flanked by two thinner white stripes ( blue-white-red-white-blue ) . First worn in the 1973–74 season , the so-called \" Hechter shirt \" has remained the classic home identity of PSG ever since . The famous jersey made its debut during a home Ligue 2 game against Red Star on November 10 , 1973 . This was also the club \\'s maiden match at the Parc des Princes . PSG won 3–1 as Othniel Dossevi scored the club \\'s first goal at the stadium as well as the first with the Hechter shirt . PSG stars from the 1990s and 2000s like Raí , Ronaldinho and Pauleta are associated with this kit . While wearing it , the capital club reached five European semi-finals in a row between 1993 and 1997 , claimed the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup and achieved eight consecutive wins against Le Classique arch-rivals Olympique de Marseille between 2002 and 2004 . The general belief is that Hechter based his creation on the red-and-white jersey worn by Ajax , the dominant team in Europe at the time , but with the French flag in mind . Hechter himself has denied this , though , instead claiming he was inspired by the Ford Mustang . He transposed the car \\'s hood stripes on the shirt and employed the three colours of the club . The Hechter shirt has two alternate versions : the \" reversed Hechter \" ( red-white-blue-white-red ) , introduced in the 1974–75 season , and the \" white Hechter \" ( white-blue-red-blue-white ) , which premiered in the 1994–95 season . It was with the club \\'s most iconic away outfit , though , that fans saw the first big PSG team which won their maiden Coupe de France titles in 1982 and 1983 , experienced their first European campaign in 1983 and claimed their maiden league crown in 1986 . The shirt was white with blue and red vertical stripes on the left . Like the Hechter jersey , it debuted in the 1973–74 season as the away kit . Promoted by PSG president Francis Borelli , the white shirt was the club \\'s home identity from 1981 to 1990 . Now known as the \" Borelli shirt , \" it is synonym with PSG legends from the 1980s like Safet Sušić , Luis Fernández and Dominique Bathenay . Crest evolution The first crest of Paris Saint-Germain was basically the same as the original Paris FC ( PFC ) logo . Having to merge and give birth to the club using Stade Saint-Germain \\'s stadium , the PFC crest kept its original design but the name below it changed from \" Paris FC \" to \" Paris Saint-Germain Football Club . \" This badge consisted of a blue football with a red vessel inside it . The latter is a historic symbol of Paris and is present in the city \\'s coat of arms . The name of the club was written below in red . PSG , however , split from PFC in 1972 and thus needed a new crest . Representing both Paris and Saint-Germain-en-Laye , the club \\'s second crest became the basis of the one the fans know today . The round logo featured the Eiffel Tower in red against a blue background with two Saint-Germain symbols in white between its legs : a fleur de lys and Louis XIV \\'s cradle . This crest was created by Christian Lentretien , former PSG board member and publicist by profession , in 1972 . It was first used until 1982 . The Parc des Princes , the club \\'s home stadium , was added below the crest in 1982 and lasted until 1990 . Following a brief return of the traditional crest between 1990 and 1992 , former owners Canal+ radically changed it in 1992 . The new model had the acronym \" PSG \" in white against a blue-white-red-white-blue background ( like the colour pattern of the Hechter shirt ) with \" Paris Saint-Germain \" underneath in white against a black background . Under pressure from supporters , the traditional crest returned in 1995 with \" Paris Saint-Germain \" above the tower and \" 1970 \" below the cradle . This logo went through a slight facelift in 2002 . At the request of the club \\'s Qatari owners , the traditional crest underwent a major makeover in 2013 by design agency , Dragon Rouge . “ Paris ” is now written in big white bold letters above a large Eiffel Tower , clearly putting forward the brand “ Paris ” instead of “ Paris Saint-Germain . ” Underneath it , “ Saint-Germain ” is written in smaller letters below the fleur de lys . In contrast , the cradle and the club \\'s founding year \" 1970 \" were left out . PSG deputy general manager Jean-Claude Blanc said : “ We are called Paris Saint-Germain but , above all , we are called Paris . ” Friendly tournaments Paris Saint-Germain used to host two very famous invitational competitions : the Tournoi de Paris and the Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy . Regarded as French football \\'s most prestigious friendly tournament , the Tournoi de Paris is considered a precursor of both the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup . PSG began hosting it in 1975 and were crowned champions a record seven times . Held at the Parc des Princes , the Tournoi de Paris was last organized in 2012 . The Tournoi Indoor de Paris-Bercy was an indoor football tournament founded by PSG in 1984 and held annually until 1991 at the AccorHotels Arena in the 12th arrondissement of Paris . Played indoors on a synthetic field and featuring seven-a-side teams , the competition featured hosts PSG and five more clubs . The Parisians lifted the trophy on two occasions , more than any other club . Grounds Stadiums Paris Saint-Germain played their first game at their current home stadium , the 47,929-seater Parc des Princes , against Ligue 2 promotion rivals Red Star on November 10 , 1973 . It was the curtain-raiser for that season \\'s opening Ligue 1 match between Paris FC ( PFC ) and Sochaux . PSG moved into the ground upon its return to Ligue 1 in 1974 , ironically the same year that PFC were relegated . Up until that point it had been the home venue of PFC . During their early years , PSG played at several grounds including the main stadium of the Stade Municipal Georges Lefèvre sports complex , the Stade Jean-Bouin , the Stade de Paris and even the Parc des Princes a few times despite the reluctance of PFC . Ever since PSG moved to the Parc , the Stade Georges Lefèvre \\'s artificial turf and grass football pitches have hosted training sessions and home matches for the club \\'s academy sides . The complex is located in Saint-Germain-en-Laye , just across the street from the Camp des Loges , the club \\'s training center . Training facilities Located in Saint-Germain-en-Laye , the Camp des Loges has been the club \\'s training ground since 1970 . The current Camp des Loges , built on the same site as the old one , was inaugurated in November 2008 . It was then renamed Ooredoo Training Centre in September 2013 as part of a sponsorship deal with Ooredoo . The Paris Saint-Germain Training Center will be the club \\'s new training ground and sports complex . It will replace the Camp des Loges upon its completion in June 2023 . Owned and financed by the club , the venue will bring together PSG \\'s male football , handball and judo teams , as well as the football and handball academies . The club , however , will remain closely linked to their historic birthplace in Saint-Germain-en-Laye as the Camp des Loges will become the training ground of the female football team and academy . Support Paris Saint-Germain is the most popular football club in France and one of the most widely supported teams in the world . Famous PSG fans include Nicolas Sarkozy , Tony Parker , Tom Brady , Patrick Dempsey , Victoria Azarenka , Teddy Riner and DJ Snake . Lacking a big passionate fanbase , the club began offering cheaper season tickets to young supporters in 1976 . These fans were placed in the Kop K , located in the K section of the Borelli stand at the Parc des Princes . Following an increase in ticket prices , Kop K supporters moved to the Boulogne stand in 1978 , and the Kop of Boulogne ( KoB ) was born . There , the club \\'s first Italian-style ultra group , Boulogne Boys , was founded in 1985 . Other KoB groups , however , took British hooligans as dubious role models and violence rapidly escalated . PSG supporters \\' groups have been linked to football hooliganism ever since . PSG owners Canal+ responded in 1991 by encouraging and financing non-violent fans of the KoB stand to take place in the Auteuil stand at the other end of the Parc des Princes . The Virage Auteuil was born , alongside Supras Auteuil , its most notorious ultras . At first the measure worked but , slowly , a violent rivalry arose between the two stands . Things came to a head in 2010 before a match against Olympique de Marseille in Paris . Boulogne fan Yann Lorence was killed following a fight between groups from both stands outside the Parc des Princes , forcing PSG president Robin Leproux to take action . The club exiled the supporters \\' groups from the Parc des Princes and banned them from all PSG matches in what was known as Plan Leproux . It made PSG pay the price in terms of atmosphere , with one of Europe \\'s most feared venues now subdued . For their part , former Virage Auteuil supporters formed the Collectif Ultras Paris ( CUP ) in February 2016 , with the aim of reclaiming their place at the stadium . In October 2016 , after a six-year absence , the club agreed to their return . Grouped in the Auteuil end of the stadium , the CUP currently is the only ultra association officially recognized by PSG . The ultra movement has also started to come back to life in the Boulogne stand . New groups Block Parisii , Paname Rebirth and Résistance Parisienne are trying to convince the club of relaunching the Kop of Boulogne . Rivalries Paris Saint-Germain shares an intense rivalry with Olympique de Marseille ; matches between the two teams are referred to as Le Classique . Equivalent to Spain \\'s El Clásico , the fixture is the biggest rivalry in France and one of the greatest in the world . The level of animosity is such that it extends outside of the pitch . Both sets of fans have been clashing against each other almost since the very first encounters between the two sides . The duo are the two most successful clubs in French football history and the only two French teams to have won major European trophies . Moreover , PSG and OM were the dominant forces in the land prior to the emergence of Olympique Lyonnais in the 2000s . They are also the two most popular clubs in France and the two most followed French teams outside the country , ahead of Lyon . Both clubs are at or near the top of the attendance lists every season as well . In their early meetings during the 1970s there was little indication the two would become deadly adversaries . The newly formed Parisians were trying to assemble a competitive team , while the Olympians were Ligue 1 contenders . It all changed in 1986 , when PSG won its first championship and OM were bought by Bernard Tapie . By the end of the decade , PSG were fighting for the 1988–89 title against Tapie \\'s star-studded Marseille , and sparks flew for the first time . The accusations made by PSG president Francis Borelli against Tapie and OM for fixing matches during that season were a big contributor to their growing antagonism . The 1990s were the real starting point of the rivalry , though . French TV channel Canal+ bought PSG in 1991 with the aim of breaking Marseille \\'s hegemony , but agreed with Tapie to fuel the animosity between them as a way to spice up the league . Now with similar financial power , PSG and OM established themselves as top contenders in the title race . Both sides were less successful in the late 1990s and throughout the 2000s , but the rivalry remained just as fierce . However , since the 2010s , the matchup has been completely dominated by PSG . The investment of their mega-rich Qatar owners has created a wide gap between them and Marseille . Ownership and finances During its first three years of existence , Paris Saint-Germain was fan-owned and had 20,000 socios . The club was run by board members Guy Crescent , Pierre-Étienne Guyot and Henri Patrelle . A group of wealthy French businessmen , led by Daniel Hechter and Francis Borelli , would then buy the club in 1973 . PSG changed hands in 1991 , when Canal+ took over , and then again in 2006 with the arrival of Colony Capital . Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani , the Emir of Qatar , has been PSG \\'s owner since 2011 through state-run shareholding organization Qatar Sports Investments ( QSI ) . A subsidiary of Qatar \\'s sovereign wealth fund Qatar Investment Authority ( QIA ) , QSI became the club \\'s majority shareholders in June 2011 and sole shareholders in March 2012 . This means PSG are a state-owned club , the only of its kind , and thus one of the richest teams in the world . QSI chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi has been PSG president since the takeover . Al Thani , however , has the final word on every major decision of the club . He is both the chairman of the QIA and the founder of QSI . Upon its arrival , QSI pledged to form a team capable of winning the UEFA Champions League and making the club France \\'s biggest name . PSG have spent over €1.3bn on player transfers since the summer of 2011 . These massive expenditures have translated in PSG \\'s domination of French football but have not yet brought home the coveted Champions League trophy as well as causing problems with UEFA \\'s Financial Fair Play regulations . As of the 2019–20 season , PSG have the seventh-highest revenue in the footballing world with an annual turnover of €541m according to Deloitte , and are the world \\'s ninth most valuable football club , worth $ 2.5bn according to Forbes magazine . PSG \\'s strong financial position has been sustained by the club \\'s Qatari owners ; the team \\'s on-pitch success ; high-profile signings like Zlatan Ibrahimović , David Beckham , Neymar , Kylian Mbappé and Lionel Messi ; and lucrative sponsorship deals with the Qatar Tourism Authority , Nike , Accor and Air Jordan . Throughout their history , though , PSG have rarely been profitable . Prior to the Qatar buyout , the club \\'s cumulative losses amounted to €300m . Honours As of the end of the 2020–21 Ligue 1 season . Paris Saint-Germain holds many records , most notably being the most successful French club in history in terms of official titles won , with 45 . Domestically , PSG have clinched nine Ligue 1 championships , a record fourteen Coupe de France , a record nine Coupe de la Ligue , a record ten Trophée des Champions and one Ligue 2 title . In international club football , they have claimed one UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup and one UEFA Intertoto Cup . Additionally , PSG have won 24 unofficial titles . Their victory in the 1995–96 UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup makes PSG the sole French side to have won this trophy as well as one of only two French clubs to have won a major European competition and the youngest European team to do so . The Parisians are also the club with the most consecutive seasons in the top-flight ( 47 seasons in Ligue 1 since 1974–75 ) . Furthermore , PSG are the only side to have won the Coupe de France without conceding a single goal ( 1992–93 and 2016–17 ) , five Coupe de la Ligue in a row ( 2014–2018 ) , four back-to-back Coupe de France ( 2015–2018 ) , and eight consecutive Trophée des Champions ( 2013–2020 ) . PSG have won all four national titles in a single season on four occasions . This feat is known as the domestic quadruple . The Red and Blues have completed the domestic double , the league and league cup double , the domestic cup double and the domestic treble several times as well . Therefore , PSG are the club with the most domestic doubles and league and league cup doubles , and the only team to have won the domestic cup double , the domestic treble and the domestic quadruple .

In 1979 , the cafe began covering its walls with rock and roll memorabilia , a tradition which expanded to others in the chain . In 2007 , Hard Rock Cafe International ( USA ) , Inc . was sold to the Seminole Tribe of Florida and was headquartered in Orlando , Florida , until April 2018 , when the corporate offices were relocated to Davie , Florida . As of July 2018 , Hard Rock International has venues in 74 countries , including 185 cafes , 25 hotels , and 12 casinos . On June 10 , 2021 , Hard Rock announced Lionel Messi as its Hard Rock brand ambassador as the company celebrated its 50th anniversary . History Restaurants The first Hard Rock Cafe opened on June 14 , 1971 at 150 Old Park Lane , Hyde Park , Mayfair , London , under the ownership of two Americans , Isaac Tigrett and Peter Morton . Hard Rock initially had an eclectic decor , but it later started to display memorabilia . In 1978 , a second location was opened in Toronto , Canada . The chain began to expand worldwide in 1982 with locations in ( among others ) Los Angeles , San Francisco , Chicago , Paris , and Berlin . Hard Rock Cafe locations in the United States vary from smaller , more tourist driven markets ( Biloxi , Pigeon Forge , Key West , etc . ) to large metropolises ( Houston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , New York City , Chicago , Boston , Washington , D.C. , etc . ) . Hard Rock Cafe typically does not franchise cafe locations in the United States . All US cafes are corporate owned and operated , except for cafes in Tampa and the Four Winds New Buffalo casino . However , in the transition of the Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel property originally owned and then later sold to Rank by founder Peter Morton , Morton retained hotel naming rights west of the Mississippi . When Morton sold his Las Vegas Hard Rock Hotel to the Morgans Hotel Group , he also sold those naming rights , which then gave rise to two US franchised hotels ( without cafes ) in Albuquerque and Tulsa . The Albuquerque hotel no longer pays for the Hard Rock rights and reverted to its former name in June 2013 . Additional casino hotels franchised from Morgan \\'s were subsequently opened in Sioux City and Vancouver . In 1990 , The Rank Group , a London-based leisure company , acquired Mecca Leisure Group and continued expansion of the concept in its geographic territory . Rank went on to purchase Hard Rock America from Peter Morton as well as Hard Rock Canada from Nick Bitove . After the completion of these acquisitions , Rank gained worldwide control of the brand . In March 2007 , the Seminole Tribe of Florida acquired Hard Rock Cafe International , Inc . and other related entities from Rank for US $ 965 million . In 2008 , anonymous members of the wait staff criticized the business because of its practice of paying them less than half the official minimum wage in the UK , with the business allocating tips to staff to bring their salaries within the law . Most customers , it was argued , do not realize that they are subsidizing a low wage when they give the tip . Music memorabilia HRC is known for its collection of rock-and-roll memorabilia . The cafes solicit donations of music memorabilia but also purchase a number of items at auctions around the world , including autographed guitars , costumes from world tours and rare photographs ; these are often to be found mounted on cafe walls . The collection began in 1979 with an un-signed Red Fender Lead II guitar from Eric Clapton , who was a regular at the first restaurant in London . Clapton wanted management to hang the guitar over his regular seat in order to lay claim to that spot , and they obliged . This prompted Pete Townshend of The Who to give one of his guitars , also un-signed with the note \" Mine \\'s as good as his ! Love , Pete . \" Hard Rock \\'s archive includes over 80,000 items , and is the largest private collection of Rock and Roll memorabilia in the world . Marquee pieces from the collection were briefly displayed in a Hard Rock museum named \" The Vault \" in Orlando , Florida from January 2003 until September 2004 . After the closure , items were distributed to various restaurant locations . The London Vault remains open and free to visitors , located in the retail Rock Shop of the original cafe . The Hard Rock Café is also in possession of a Bedford VAL three axle coach used in the 1967 Beatles film Magical Mystery Tour . The vehicle was completely refurbished after filming . It is currently displayed in the US , but makes regular appearances in events in the UK , especially at the original Hard Rock Cafe in London . In 2001 , a competition was run to win the actual bus , but it was never given away and remained with the cafe . Expansion into other businesses Casinos and hotels In 1995 , Peter Morton spent $ 80 million to open the Hard Rock Hotel near the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas , Nevada . A subsequent $ 100 million expansion in 1999 nearly doubled the hotel \\'s capacity . In May 2006 , Morton sold the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino , Las Vegas to Morgans Hotel Group for $ 770 million , including the rights to the Hard Rock Hotel brand west of the Mississippi , including Texas , California , Australia , and Vancouver , British Columbia . The hotel began another expansion in 2007 at a cost of $ 750 million . The project added 875 rooms in two towers and expanded meeting space . In March 2011 , Morgans surrendered control of the property to partner Brookfield Asset Management , citing the high debt on the property in the face of the economic downturn . In April 2018 , the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas was sold to Richard Branson with plans to renovate the property under the Virgin Hotels brand . Today , the Seminole Tribe of Florida owns and operates all units except the Las Vegas , Sioux City , Tulsa , and Vancouver properties . In 2004 , Hard Rock International and Sol Melia Hotels and Resorts launched Lifestar Hoteles España SL , a joint venture that intended to manage Europe \\'s first Hard Rock Hotel in Madrid , but it was never opened as a Hard Rock property upon the dissolution of the joint venture in 2007 . The other joint venture hotels are in Chicago , New York , and San Diego ( the San Diego property includes Hard Rock condominiums ) . Hard Rock also operates hotels and resorts in Orlando , Florida ( a joint venture with Loews Hotels ) ; Bali , Indonesia ; and Pattaya , Thailand , ( a joint venture with Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited ) . Hard Rock International continues to expand internationally ( including hotels , casinos , resorts , and condominiums ) through several joint ventures ( Becker Ventures , Ong Beng Seng/Hotel Properties Limited and Loews Hotels ) , including hotels in Chicago , Bali , Orlando , Penang , San Diego , Singapore , and planned openings in Abu Dhabi , Cancun , Dubai , Hungary , Panama , Punta Cana and Puerto Vallarta , as well as hotel-casinos in Hollywood , Florida ; Tampa , Florida ; Las Vegas , Nevada ; and Catoosa , Oklahoma , just northeast of Tulsa . ( The Hard Rock Casino in Biloxi , MS is owned by Twin River Management Group , Inc . ) Opened on 20 January 2010 in Singapore at Sentosa , the Hard Rock Hotel at Resorts World Sentosa is owned by the Genting Group . The Hotel Zoso in Palm Springs , California was converted into a 160-room Hard Rock Hotel and opened in 2014 . A location in Atlantic City , New Jersey was planned in 2010 , but those plans were canceled in 2012 ; however , in 2017 , they acquired from Icahn Enterprises the closed Trump Taj Mahal , which in 2018 was reopened as Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Atlantic City . All-inclusive resorts operate under the Hard Rock brand in the Dominican Republic and Mexico . In 2013 , the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park opened as a joint slot machine and track venture. , near Cleveland , Ohio . Then in early 2019 , it was announced that JACK Cincinnati Casino in Cincinnati was sold for $ 745 million to Vici Properties and Hard Rock International , with Vici acquiring the land and buildings for $ 558 million and Hard Rock buying the operating business for $ 187 million . Hard Rock would lease the casino from Vici for $ 43 million per year , and would rebrand it as Hard Rock Casino Cincinnati . Canada had numerous restaurants but many of them closed , notably the one at Yonge-Dundas Square in Toronto in May 2017 , which had been the chain \\'s second location , leaving just two in that country , Niagara Falls , Ont. , and the Hard Rock Casino in Coquitlam , B.C . In 2015 , Hard Rock announced a new hotel in Bogotá , Colombia , which will open in 2019 . The company had plans to open in the biggest financial district in Colombia , the Centro Internacional , but it revised those plans . The hotel will be located in the exclusive Zona Rosa de Bogotá , home of luxury boutiques . In July 2019 , Hard Rock International announced plans for a casino in Rockford , Illinois , about 75 miles west of Chicago along I-90 . Two other proposals were made for the city \\'s lone casino license , but the city council only recommended the Hard Rock proposal to the Illinois Gaming Board , who will decide which site will get the license . The temporary casino , named Rockford Casino-A Hard Rock Opening Act , opened on November 10 , 2021 . It features a Rock Shop , Hard Rock memorabilia , slots , and two restaurants . The permanent casino is planned to open within two years and feature a Hard Rock Cafe , live music venue , 90 foot tall replica of a Rick Nielson guitar , and will be a full-fledge Hard Rock Casino .

Hard Rock Park opened on April 15 , 2008 in Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . The park was expected to draw an estimated 30,000 visitors per day , promised to create more than 3,000 jobs , and was billed as the largest single investment in South Carolina \\'s history . It planned to feature a large concert arena and six zones with more than 40 attractions . HRP Myrtle Beach Operations , LLC , filed for Chapter 11 on September 25 , 2008 . The company hoped to re-open in 2009 after restructuring . On January 2 , 2009 after failing to attract a buyer with a minimum $ 35 million bid for over two months , Hard Rock Park asked a Delaware Bankruptcy Court to convert the filing to Chapter 7 triggering immediate liquidation of assets to pay off creditors , and closing the park . New owners renamed the venue Freestyle Music Park and planned to reopen retaining a music-theme , but without the Hard Rock name , by Memorial Day , 2009 . The park only operated one additional year and then closed , due to poor attendance . Stadiums In August 2016 , it was reported that the Miami Dolphins \\' stadium in Miami Gardens , Florida would be renamed Hard Rock Stadium . Super Bowl LIV was held there on February 2 , 2020 . The Hard Rock Club is a sponsored bar at the Canadian Tire Centre , with Hard Rock branding and memorabilia . The stadium formerly housed Ottawa \\'s first Hard Rock Café when it opened as The Palladium on January 15 , 1996 , and for many years when it was known as the Corel Centre . The café closed on August 8 , 2002 and was replaced with the Frank Finnigan \\'s restaurant . Since October 17 , 2013 , the restaurant is known as Chek Point , and is sponsored by SportChek . The Hard Rock Club bar was announced on October 9 , 2018 and opened near the former Hard Rock Café . The bar features memorabilia from over a dozen artists , restaurant-style seating , and dedicated stadium seating . Acquisition by the Seminole Tribe of Florida On December 7 , 2006 , Rank sold its Hard Rock business to the Seminole Tribe of Florida for $ 965 million . Included in the deal were 124 Hard Rock Cafes , four Hard Rock Hotels , two Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Hotels , two Hard Rock Live ! concert venues , and stakes in three unbranded hotels . Rank retained the Hard Rock Casino in London , and rebranded it the G Casino Piccadilly . The Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas was also not part of the deal , as it was sold by Peter Morton to Morgans Hotel Group in May 2006 . The final takeover was mired in controversy , due to a payment clause in a contract with one casino developer , Power Plant Entertainment . Power Plant and the Seminoles announced a settlement in April 2007 which both sides called equitable . On January 8 , 2007 , Rank shareholders approved the Seminoles \\' $ 965 million offer . The Tribe announced it had finalized the deal on March 11 , 2007 . On June 22 , 2008 , the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel & Casino Hollywood began \" Vegas-style \" table gambling in addition to the Class II slots already in operation . To win approval for the table games , which were barred under Florida law , the Seminole Tribe paid the State of Florida $ 100 million as part of a 25-year pact signed by Governor Charlie Crist . On July 3 , 2008 , the Florida Supreme Court ruled that the governor \\'s agreement was unconstitutional , but table games continue to operate because the Federal Department of the Interior approved the now-invalid pact with the state .

The first European settlement was established in 1527 , at the confluence of the Paraná and Carcarañá rivers , when Sebastián Gaboto , on his way to the north , founded a fort named Sancti Spiritus , which was destroyed two years later by the natives . In 1573 Juan de Garay founded the city of Santa Fe in the surroundings of present town Cayastá , but the city was moved in 1651 and 1660 to its present location . In 1812 the lawyer and general Manuel Belgrano created and displayed for the first time the Argentine flag on the banks of the Paraná River , at Rosario ( by that time a small village ) , south of Santa Fe . In 1815 , while Alvear \\'s central government fell due to Ignacio Álvarez Thomas \\' rebellion ( at that time commander of an army sent to Santa Fe against Artigas ) , Francisco Candioti , the local militia chief , took over the government peacefully , thus starting the era of Santa Fe as an autonomous province . This period was short lived , since that same year Candioti died and central government reestablished the dependent government . However , in 1816 , the caudillos Mariano Vera and Estanislao López deposed the governor delegate and proclaimed the sovereignty of the province and its membership into Artigas \\'s Free Peoples League ( Liga de Pueblos Libres ) . López drew , in 1818 , a provincial constitution of a strongly conservative flavour , after rejecting a project proposed by a provincial assembly ; Santa Fe was the first province to have its constitution . During the civil strifes of 1820 , Santa Fe troops were decisive in the defeat of Buenos Aires \\' centralist army . So , in time , López gradually became the Federation \\'s Patriarch , establishing himself as the central figure of the Federal Party until his death in 1838 . After López \\'s death it was his secretary and right hand man , José María Cullen who was elected governor . However , Cullen being a potential rival of Buenos Aires governor and Confederation \\'s Foreign Affairs Representative , Juan Manuel de Rosas , he sought and obtained Cullen \\'s capture and execution , naming the pro-Rosas Juan Pablo López as governor . The new governor remained in power , alternating with Pascual Echagüe , until the province \\'s invasion by Justo José de Urquiza \\'s Great Army in 1851 , and during his term the province adopted a new constitution in 1841 . After the organization of the nation , the province entered an era of peace and prosperity ; in 1872 the railways already connected many points of the province , as well as the telegraph lines , and in 1889 the Provincial University of Santa Fe was founded . The political hegemony of the conservative groups was challenged by the new ideas brought by the European immigrants gave birth to the Radical Civic Union ( UCR ) and the Progressive Democratic Party ( PDP ) , and the creation of the Argentine Agrarian Federation . These two parties had many strong electoral contests with the province \\'s conservative parties . After the Electoral Reform of Roque Sáenz Peña in 1912 , the UCR reached the government and stayed until the coup of 1930 . During this time , more precisely in 1919 , the National University of the Littoral was founded . In 1932 it was the PDP who got the governor \\'s seat . The contentious 1958 elections ( from which Peronist candidates were barred ) brought an ally of President-elect Arturo Frondizi to power in Santa Fe , Dr . Carlos Sylvestre Begnis . Gov . Begnis quickly steered budgets into sorely needed public works , most notably the construction of the Hernandarias Tunnel , a -long connection between the city of Santa Fe and neighboring Paraná . The tunnel , most of which runs under the massive Paraná River , is the longest in Argentina . Forced to resign after conservative pressure drove President Frondizi from office in 1962 , Begnis had the satisfaction of seeing Hernandarias open in 1969 , and voters overwhelmingly return him to office in 1973 ( this time as a Peronist ) . Santa Fe suffered the violence of the late \\'70s and the depression of the 1980s more than most other provinces . It continued to languish economically during the prosperous 1990s , as the revalued Argentine peso put pressure on its productive sectors . Touching bottom around 2002 , its economy has grown by 7 % a year since then . The heart of Argentina \\'s lucrative soy harvest , the province \\'s importance has continued to grow , now rivaling Buenos Aires Province as the nation \\'s leading agricultural producer , with Rosario as one of the most important ports in Argentina . Geography and climate Most of the province consists of green flatlands , part of the humid Pampas , bordering to the north with the Gran Chaco region . There are low sierras to the west . The north has higher temperatures , with an annual average of and precipitations of up to in the east , decreasing towards the west , where there is a distinctive dry season during the winter . The south presents lower temperatures , averaging , and slightly less precipitations . Summers are hot and humid throughout the province , with average highs ranging from 30 °C ( 86F ) in the south to 34 °C ( 93F ) in the northwest corner , and night temperatures between 17 °C ( 63F ) in the south and 21 °C ( 70F ) in the north . Thunderstorms are common , and so are heat waves what can bring temperatures up to 40 °C ( 104F ) and hot muggy nights . These are often interrupted by cold fronts that bring crisp , cool weather from the south . March brings cooler nights in the south , and April brings comfortable weather , with highs ranging from 22 °C ( 72F ) in the south to 26 °C ( 79F ) in the north , and lows from 10 °C ( 50F ) to 15 °C ( 59F ) . Frost arrives in May in the south , where it occurs frequently until September ; in the extreme north , frost is much more sporadic : some years might bring frosty May days , on other years it may come in July , but generally speaking there will always be a few frosty days every year even in the extreme north . Winter is drier in the west of the province and wetter in the east . In the south , temperatures range from 15 °C ( 59F ) in the day to 4 °C ( 39F ) at night , whereas in the north , from 21 °C ( 70F ) to 9 °C ( 48F ) . Cold waves often bring temperatures of -5 °C ( 23F ) in the south , with extremes of -8 °C ( 18F ) recorded ; further north , the thermometer descends occasionally to -2 °C ( 28F ) and very rarely to -5 °C ( 23F ) . There are often short warm periods of up to 30 °C ( 86F ) during the winter , followed by much colder weather with drizzle and temperatures around 6 °C ( 43F ) . Spring starts as soon as the end of August in the north , with very warm weather already present by early October ; in the south , nights remain cool until most of November . Generally speaking , spring is unpredictable , with heat waves followed by extended periods of cool weather , as well as dry spells followed by severe thunderstorms . Rainfall ranges from 1,200 mm ( 47 in ) in the northeast to 800 mm ( 31 in ) in the southwest and extreme northwest . Snowfall is unprecedented in the northern two-thirds of the province , and very rare in the south , where the last occurrence was in 2007 with several centimeters accumulated . This humid , temperate climate explains why Central and Southern Santa Fe are among the nation \\'s richest agricultural regions , with crops such as maize and soybeans popular , and a very well developed dairy industry . The main river , and connection to open sea through the Río de la Plata is the Paraná River . There are also other tributaries to the Paraná including the Salado del Norte , the Carcarañá and the Arroyo del Medio . The plain lands tend to be flooded after heavy rains due to the growth of the Paraná and Salado rivers . In 2003 a rapid rise of the Salado produced a catastrophic flood of the capital and many communities in the north-center of the province , prompting the evacuation of no fewer than 100,000 people and major economic losses . In 2007 , several days of heavy rainfall flooded more than 60 towns in the center and south of the province , including sections of Santa Fe and Rosario , causing tens of thousands of people to be evacuated , crop losses , and widespread damage to the physical infrastructure of the area . Economy Santa Fe \\'s economy is the fourth most important in the country , having been displaced from third place by neighboring Córdoba Province around 1970 . Accounting for 8 % of the Argentine total , its output was estimated at US $ 27 billion in 2006 ( which shall be around US $ 43 billion in 2011 according to Argentina \\'s economical growing ) , or , US $ 9,000 per capita ( around US $ 13,000 in 2011 ) , somewhat above the national average . Though the economy is well-diversified , agriculture continues to play an indispensable role through its profitability and foreign exchange earnings via exports . Twenty-one percent of the cultivated lands of Argentina are in Santa Fe , whose main crops are soybean ( main national producer ) , sunflower , maize , wheat , and rice . In smaller scale strawberry , honey and derivatives ( 300,000 beehives ) , wood , and cotton are produced . The green grass of the province is ideal for the 6.5 million head of cattle ( 20 % of national stock ) , which is not only source of meat but of 2.6 billion of liters of milk per year ( 40 % of the national production ) , which is processed by over 5,000 dairies . The ports between Rosario and San Lorenzo are departure points for the export of the production of the Santa Fe and many other provinces ; through them leave 65 % of the Argentine cereal and 55 % of the country \\'s exports . In 2004 , Santa Fe \\'s exports ( US $ 7,170 million ) accounted for 21 % of the national total . Between 2001 and 2004 they increased 65.2 % . Derivates of soybean , flours and vegetable oils comprised over US $ 2 billion and over 7.6 million tonnes . In 2005 the ports of southern Santa Fe shipped 60 % of the grains , 93 % of the agricultural subproducts and 85 % of the vegetable oils exported by Argentina . Manufacturing in Santa Fe represents 18 % of its economy and is also among the top in Argentina . Mills that produce different flours and oils , beer , and other food industries , leather and textiles , hydrocarbon refineries , steel ( 1 million tonnes a year ) and metals production , industrial and agricultural machines , car industry and others . The services sector is well-developed and very diversified , relying little on tourism or the public sector . Tourism is not an important activity in spite of the wide range of hotels and restaurants . Rosario , home to the National Flag Memorial ( Monumento Nacional a la Bandera ) and a number of museums , receives a number of visitors from Argentina . The replica of the Sancti Spiritus Fort , the ruins of Cayastá and the city of Santa Fe are also common destinations . Government The provincial government is divided into the usual three branches : the executive , headed by a governor , popularly elected for non-reelegible four-year terms , who appoint the cabinet ; the legislative , formed by a bicameral legislature ( a 50-member Chamber of Deputies and a 19-member Senate , all elected for four-year terms ) ; and the judiciary , headed by the Supreme Court and completed by several inferior tribunals . The Constitution of Santa Fe Province forms the formal law of the province . From 1991 , the executive and legislative officials were elected in single-round elections by a controversial system known as the Ley de Lemas . This system was abolished in 2004 ; the new one includes compulsory primary elections , which were held for the first time in August 2005 , with good results according to most analysis . The parliamentary elections of 23 October 2005 were the first main elections to be held after the abolition of the Ley de Lemas . In Argentina , the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Santa Fe Provincial Police . Demographics The origin of the population is majority European , descended from the great wave of immigration from 1850–1950 , being Italians ( mainly from Piedmont ) , Spanish , Swiss and Germans the main ethnic groups in the province . Since 1970 , Rosario has been chosen by internal migrants , mainly from the north of Santa Fe and the northern provinces . A smaller minority of the population ( 20 % ) are Mestizos and an even lesser number ( 2-4 % ) are of full Amerindian descent . Population distribution Evolution Historical evolution of the population of the province : XVIII cent . : 12,000 1820 : 15,000-20,000 1847 : 20,000 1853 : 30,000 1869 : 89,117 1895 : 397,188 1914 : 899,640 1947 : 1,702,975 1960 : 1,884,918 1970 : 2,135,583 1980 : 2,465,546 Administrative division The province is divided into 19 departments ( in Spanish , departamentos ) , and the departments are divided in districts which can be organized as communes or municipalities . The communes are smaller towns , generally administered by a local commission led by a \" communal president \" . The municipalities , which must have more than 10,000 inhabitants , are what is commonly called \" cities \" . Municipalities have an executive officer ( a mayor , called intendente ) and a legislative body ( called Concejo Municipal , a deliberative council ) . For administrative purposes , each department has a head town ( cabecera ) , which may be either kind of district .

Tourism in Santa Fe , Argentina Provinces of Argentina States and territories established in 1816', 'The Harlem Globetrotters is an American exhibition basketball team . They combine athleticism , theater , and comedy in their style of play . Created by Abe Saperstein in 1927 in Chicago , Illinois , the team adopted the name Harlem because of its connotations as a major African-American community . Over the years they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 124 countries and territories , mostly against deliberately ineffective opponents , such as the Washington Generals ( 1953–1995 ) and the New York Nationals ( 1995–present ) . The team \\'s signature song is Brother Bones \\' whistled version of \" Sweet Georgia Brown \" , and their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named \" Globie \" . The team is currently owned by Herschend Family Entertainment . History The Globetrotters originated on the South Side of Chicago in 1926 , where all the original players were raised . The Globetrotters began as the Savoy Big Five , one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom , opened in January 1928 , a basketball team of Black American players that played exhibitions before dances due to declining dance attendance . In 1928 , several players left the team in a dispute . That autumn , those players , led by Tommy Brookins , formed a team called the \" Globe Trotters \" and toured southern Illinois that spring . Abe Saperstein became involved with the team as its manager and promoter . By 1929 , Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the \" New York Harlem Globe Trotters \" . Saperstein selected the name Harlem because it was then considered the center of Black American culture and the name Globetrotter to mythologize the team \\'s international venues . The Globetrotters were perennial participants in the World Professional Basketball Tournament , winning it in 1940 . In a heavily attended matchup a few years later , the 1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game , the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country , the Minneapolis Lakers ( now the Los Angeles Lakers ) . The Globetrotters continued to easily win games due to Harlem monopolizing the entire talent pool of the best black basketball players in the country . Once one of the most famous teams in the country , the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the National Basketball Association , particularly when NBA teams began fielding black players in the 1950s . In 1950 , Harlem Globetrotter Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate Nat \" Sweetwater \" Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract when the New York Knicks purchased his contract from the Globetrotters for $ 12,500 ( ) , with Harlem getting $ 10,000 and Clifton getting $ 2,500 . The Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to Reece \" Goose \" Tatum , who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports . The Globetrotters \\' acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful handling of one or more basketballs , such as passing or juggling balls between players , balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips , and making unusually difficult shots . In 1952 , the Globetrotters invited Louis \" Red \" Klotz to create a team to accompany them on their tours . This team , the Washington Generals ( who also played under various other names ) , became the Globetrotters \\' primary opponents . The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters , with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games . In 1959 , the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Grigoryevich , the director of Lenin Central Stadium . The team , which included Wilt Chamberlain , was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities , they met Premier Nikita Khrushchev and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal . However , according to one report , spectators were initially confused : \" A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently , as if in awe , through the first half of the game . It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition . \" The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals , but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers . A review in Pravda stated , \" This is not basketball ; it is too full of tricks \" but praised the Globetrotters \\' skills and suggested that \" they have some techniques to show us \" . The American press—particularly Drew Pearson—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid ( per game ) the equivalent of $ 4,000 ( ) , which could be spent only in Moscow . The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Soviet relations were improving , that Moscow was backing off its criticism of race relations inside America , and that the USSR was becoming more capitalist ( Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money ) . In May 1967 , New York City-based Metromedia announced that it would acquire the Globetrotters for $ 1 million , but the deal was never completed and later sold to George N . Gillett Jr . and formed a new company called Globetrotters Communications in 1968 . Nine years after the company \\'s attempted acquisition in 1976 , Metromedia announced that it would re-acquire the Globetrotters for $ 11 million from Globetrotter Communications . Many famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters . Greats such as \" Wee \" Willie Gardner , Connie \" The Hawk \" Hawkins , Wilt \" The Stilt \" Chamberlain , and Nat \" Sweetwater \" Clifton later joined the NBA . The Globetrotters signed their first female player , Olympic gold medalist Lynette Woodard , in 1985 . Because nearly all of the team \\'s players have been black , and as a result of the buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters \\' skits , they drew some criticism during the Civil Rights era . The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of \" Tomming for Abe , \" a reference to Uncle Tom and owner Abe Saperstein . However , prominent civil rights activist Jesse Jackson ( who would later be named an Honorary Globetrotter ) came to their defense by stating , \" I think they \\'ve been a positive influence ... They did not show blacks as stupid . On the contrary , they were shown as superior . \" In 1986 , as part of the spin-off of Metromedia \\'s television stations to News Corporation and the 20th Century Fox film studio , the company sold the Globetrotters and the Ice Capades to the Minneapolis-based International Broadcasting Corporation ( owners of KTAB-TV in Abilene , Texas and controlled by Thomas Scallen ) for $ 30 million . In 1993 , former Globetrotters player Mannie Jackson purchased the team from the International Broadcasting Corporation , which was on the verge of bankruptcy . In 1995 , Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team . He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters \\' roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43 . While parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned , the games themselves are not fixed . While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters \\' hijinks while on defense , they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is \" real . \" This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals in 1971 , to the distress of the watching crowd , after the Globetrotters lost track of a big lead with their tricks and the Generals hit a game-winning buzzer-beater . In September 2005 , Shamrock Holdings purchased 80 % stake in the Globetrotters . In October 2013 , Herschend Family Entertainment announced that it would acquire the Globetrotters from Shamrock Holdings .

It was constructed at a cost of $ 352 million and has a seating capacity of 72,220 . It was the first NFL facility to have a retractable roof . The stadium is the home of the National Football League \\'s Houston Texans , the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo , the Texas Bowl , many of the United States men \\'s national soccer team \\'s matches , Mexico national football team friendlies where El Tri serves as the host , and other events . The stadium served as the host facility for Super Bowls XXXVIII ( 2004 ) and LI ( 2017 ) , and WrestleMania 25 ( 2009 ) . NRG Stadium is part of a collection of venues ( including the Astrodome ) , which are collectively called NRG Park . The entire complex is named for NRG Energy under a 32-year , US $ 300 million naming rights deal in 2000 . History The Houston NFL Holdings group came to Populous ( then HOK Sport ) to begin the schematic design for the first-ever NFL retractable roof football stadium in 1997 . The intention was to create a football stadium to replace the Astrodome that would operate like an open-air facility but have the intimacy and comfort of an indoor arena . With the design for football and the square footage requirements of the rodeo , the building was designed in the range . Groundbreaking for the stadium was on March 9 , 2000 and the building was officially topped off in October 2001 . Construction was completed in 30 months . The stadium opened on August 24 , 2002 , with a preseason game between the Miami Dolphins and Houston Texans which the Dolphins won 24–3 . The stadium hosted its first regular season NFL football game between the Dallas Cowboys and the Houston Texans on September 8 , 2002 . The first rodeo was held in the stadium in February 2003 . During a Texans preseason game on August 30 , 2012 , against the Minnesota Vikings , an intoxicated fan fell to his death from an escalator . On March 19 , 2014 , the stadium was renamed NRG Stadium , after NRG Energy , the parent company of Reliant Energy . During the 2015 season , a permanent artificial surface was installed at NRG Stadium . The Texans had used a natural surface since the stadium opened , using a system of trays of sod similar to one used at Giants Stadium in its experiment with using a grass surface . In recent years , the stadium installed artificial turf to be used during high school and college games while keeping the grass for Texans games . After the Texans \\' home opener , complaints about the field conditions finally led to the installation of the artificial surface for Texans games . The surface brand is UBU Speed , which is part of Act Global . In 2017 , NRG Stadium selected Hellas Construction to install its Matrix Turf with Helix Technology at the stadium . The three year contract calls for a new turf field each year . After hosting Super Bowl LI , further upgrades were made to keep NRG Stadium competitive with other new NFL venues . The stadium \\'s first major renovation in 15 years modernized the office and team facilities . Hurricane Ike damage On the night of September 12–13 , 2008 the stadium sustained damage from Hurricane Ike forcing the Houston Texans home opener scheduled for September 14 to be postponed . Part of the roof cladding came off , and there was wind and water damage to other sections of the stadium . There were also large pieces of debris inside the stadium from the hurricane and the stadium authority declared that the stadium did not suffer significant structural damage except for the roof , and the Texans would be able to play all of their 8 home games at Reliant Stadium with the roof open . The Texans \\' home opener against the Baltimore Ravens was initially postponed one day from Sunday , September 14 , 2008 to Monday , September 15 , but when the extent of the damage from Hurricane Ike became known , the NFL rescheduled the Texans-Ravens game to week 10 ( November 9 , 2008 ) , which was to have been the bye week for the Ravens and the Texans \\' scheduled home game against the Cincinnati Bengals . That game was rescheduled to week 8 ( October 26 ) , which was to have been the bye week for both the Texans and Bengals . The Bengals bye week was moved from October 26 to November 9 , originally scheduled for the Ravens . Both the Texans and Ravens took their unexpected bye week in week 2 , the weekend Hurricane Ike hit East Texas and the Gulf Coast , despite the fact that both teams were preparing that whole week to play that game as scheduled . The stadium reopened on October 5 , 2008 when the Texans hosted the Indianapolis Colts and hosted three additional home games in October . The stadium was repaired by Houston-based rope access inspection and construction firm Reel Group Americas on February 13 , 2009 . Design and technology The stadium was designed by the architectural firms of Hermes Reed Architects and Lockwood , Andrews and Newnam who were teamed to create the Houston Stadium Consultants ( HSC ) . The architects of Populous ( then HOK Sport ) and the HSC worked together with engineers from Walter P Moore and Uni-Systems to design the stadium utilizing the principles of kinetic architecture . The facility offers a sense of transparency , with its fabric roof and expansive areas of glazing . At night , the building appears to glow from within . The extensive use of glass provides an open-air feel to the concourses , which are open to the field of play . NRG Stadium has over 7,000 club seats , 186 luxury suites , and multiple lounges and bars . The stadium can be configured to utilize a space for meetings , specialty functions , exhibits , and concerts . One of the most notable aspects of the design is the stadium \\'s retractable , fabric roof . The roof mechanization consists of two large panels that split apart at the 50 yard line , lying over and above each end zone when fully retracted . 10 parallel , tri-chord trusses ride on two parallel rails , each supported by a large , -long super-truss . Roof operation is controlled in the stadium press box via computer , containing live images of the travel path of each roof panel ; plus , furnishing live feedback from all roof components throughout the operation . The roof panels can be opened or closed in as little as 7 minutes , moving at a speed of up to -per-minute . One bleacher section behind the north end zone , called the \" Bull Pen \" , is the designated fan section for the hometeam . The fans in the Bull Pen interact directly with the action on the field , helping to create and implement fan traditions , songs , chants , and other elements of the game-day experience for spectators all over the stadium . Fans in the Bull Pen are encouraged to stand throughout the game , sing , cheer , and otherwise support the team in an enthusiastic manner . In 2011 , Reliant updated their logo and therefore had to update their signage all over the stadium . In December 2012 , it was announced that , in order to help bring the Super Bowl back to Houston , the stadium \\'s end zone displays would be replaced with the largest digital displays in any professional sports venue . The video screens were revealed August 16 , 2013 and are the second largest of their kind , at a total of of screens . This tops the previous record of AT & T Stadium in Arlington . This has since been topped by the digital display boards located in TIAA Bank Field , the home of the Jacksonville Jaguars , now home to the largest digital display boards in any stadium in the world . Stadium usage Sports Football The Houston Texans have played their home games at NRG Stadium ( formerly Reliant Stadium ) since their inception in 2002 . The annual calendar consists of 8 regular season and 1-2 pre-season games , plus any playoff games the Texans host .

Their December 7 , 2008 home game against the Tennessee Titans saw a then-record crowd of 70,831 and the December 28 , 2008 home finale against the Chicago Bears drew then a current franchise-crowd record of 70,838 .

NRG Stadium hosted Super Bowl XXXVIII on February 1 , 2004 where the New England Patriots defeated the Carolina Panthers , 32–29 in front of 71,525 in attendance . NRG Stadium hosted the Texans \\' first playoff game in franchise history on January 7 , 2012 , with Houston defeating the Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in an AFC Wild Card game , drawing 71,725 , the largest crowd ever to see a Texans game at Reliant Stadium .

During this time NRG Stadium also hosts an event on the Xtreme Bulls tour , the bull riding-only tour that is part of the PRCA , who also hosts the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo . The stadium includes a service area level to house rodeo livestock . The bulls , broncs , steers and roping calves are housed in the north end of the stadium under the lower bowl . Loading and unloading dock space to support the rodeo is located on the north end of the stadium . During rodeo performances , rolling doors will separate the dock into two receiving areas to isolate the food and concession deliveries from the rodeo equipment and livestock deliveries . A concert performance stage is located at the south end of the stadium during rodeo events and is moved into the center of the facility by a hydraulic drive system for rodeo concert performances .

Regarded as one of the greatest players of all time and labelled \" the greatest \" by FIFA , he was among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century . In 1999 he was named Athlete of the Century by the International Olympic Committee and was included in the Time list of the 100 most important people of the 20th century . In 2000 , Pelé was voted World Player of the Century by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics ( IFFHS ) , and was one of the two joint winners of the FIFA Player of the Century . His 1,279 goals in 1,363 games , which included friendlies , is recognised as a Guinness World Record . Pelé began playing for Santos at age 15 and the Brazil national team at 16 . During his international career , he won three FIFA World Cups : 1958 , 1962 and 1970 , the only player to do so . Pelé is the all-time leading goalscorer for Brazil with 77 goals in 92 games .

Averaging almost a goal per game throughout his career , Pelé was adept at striking the ball with either foot in addition to anticipating his opponents \\' movements on the field . While predominantly a striker , he could also drop deep and take on a playmaking role , providing assists with his vision and passing ability , and he would also use his dribbling skills to go past opponents . In Brazil , he is hailed as a national hero for his accomplishments in football and for his outspoken support of policies that improve the social conditions of the poor . His emergence at the 1958 World Cup where he became the first black global sporting star was a source of inspiration . Throughout his career and in his retirement , Pelé received several individual and team awards for his performance in the field , his record-breaking achievements , and legacy in the sport . Early years Pelé was born Edson Arantes do Nascimento on 23 October 1940 , in Três Corações , Minas Gerais , Brazil , the son of Fluminense footballer Dondinho ( born João Ramos do Nascimento ) and Celeste Arantes . He was the elder of two siblings . He was named after the American inventor Thomas Edison . His parents decided to remove the \" i \" and call him \" Edson \" , but there was a mistake on the birth certificate , leading many documents to show his name as \" Edison \" , not \" Edson \" , as he is called . He was originally nicknamed \" Dico \" by his family . He received the nickname \" Pelé \" during his school days , when it is claimed he was given it because of his pronunciation of the name of his favourite player , local Vasco da Gama goalkeeper Bilé , which he misspoke but the more he complained the more it stuck . In his autobiography , Pelé stated he had no idea what the name means , nor did his old friends . Apart from the assertion that the name is derived from that of Bilé , and that it is Hebrew for \" miracle \" ( פֶּ֫לֶא ) , the word has no known meaning in Portuguese . Pelé grew up in poverty in Bauru in the state of São Paulo . He earned extra money by working in tea shops as a servant . Taught to play by his father , he could not afford a proper football and usually played with either a sock stuffed with newspaper and tied with a string or a grapefruit . He played for several amateur teams in his youth , including Sete de Setembro , Canto do Rio , São Paulinho , and Amériquinha . Pelé led Bauru Athletic Club juniors ( coached by Waldemar de Brito ) to two São Paulo state youth championships . In his mid-teens , he played for an indoor football team called Radium . Indoor football had just become popular in Bauru when Pelé began playing it . He was part of the first futsal ( indoor football ) competition in the region . Pelé and his team won the first championship and several others . According to Pelé , futsal ( indoor football ) presented difficult challenges ; he said it was a lot quicker than football on the grass and that players were required to think faster because everyone is close to each other in the pitch . Pelé credits futsal for helping him think better on the spot . In addition , futsal allowed him to play with adults when he was about 14 years old . In one of the tournaments he participated , he was initially considered too young to play , but eventually went on to end up top scorer with 14 or 15 goals . \" That gave me a lot of confidence \" , Pelé said , \" I knew then not to be afraid of whatever might come \" . Club career Santos In 1956 , de Brito took Pelé to Santos , an industrial and port city located near São Paulo , to try out for professional club Santos FC , telling the directors at Santos that the 15-year-old would be \" the greatest football player in the world . \" Pelé impressed Santos coach Lula during his trial at the Estádio Vila Belmiro , and he signed a professional contract with the club in June 1956 . Pelé was highly promoted in the local media as a future superstar . He made his senior team debut on 7 September 1956 at the age of 15 against Corinthians Santo Andre and had an impressive performance in a 7–1 victory , scoring the first goal in his prolific career during the match . When the 1957 season started , Pelé was given a starting place in the first team and , at the age of 16 , became the top scorer in the league . Ten months after signing professionally , the teenager was called up to the Brazil national team . After the 1958 and the 1962 World Cup , wealthy European clubs , such as Real Madrid , Juventus and Manchester United , tried to sign him in vain ; in 1958 Inter Milan even managed to get him a regular contract , but Angelo Moratti was forced to tear the contract up at the request of Santos \\' chairman following a revolt by Santos \\' Brazilian fans . In 1961 the government of Brazil under President Jânio Quadros declared Pelé an \" official national treasure \" to prevent him from being transferred out of the country . Pelé won his first major title with Santos in 1958 as the team won the Campeonato Paulista ; Pelé would finish the tournament as top scorer with 58 goals , a record that stands today . A year later , he would help the team earn their first victory in the Torneio Rio-São Paulo with a 3–0 over Vasco da Gama . However , Santos was unable to retain the Paulista title . In 1960 , Pelé scored 33 goals to help his team regain the Campeonato Paulista trophy but lost out on the Rio-São Paulo tournament after finishing in 8th place . In the 1960 season , Pelé scored 47 goals and helped Santos regain the Campeonato Paulista . The club went on to win the Taça Brasil that same year , beating Bahia in the finals ; Pelé finished as top scorer of the tournament with 9 goals . The victory allowed Santos to participate in the Copa Libertadores , the most prestigious club tournament in the Western hemisphere . Santos \\'s most successful Copa Libertadores season started in 1962 ; the team was seeded in Group One alongside Cerro Porteño and Deportivo Municipal Bolivia , winning every match of their group but one ( a 1–1 away tie versus Cerro ) . Santos defeated Universidad Católica in the semi-finals and met defending champions Peñarol in the finals . Pelé scored twice in the playoff match to secure the first title for a Brazilian club . Pelé finished as the second top scorer of the competition with four goals . That same year , Santos would successfully defend the Campeonato Paulista ( with 37 goals from Pelé ) and the Taça Brasil ( Pelé scoring four goals in the final series against Botafogo ) . Santos would also win the 1962 Intercontinental Cup against Benfica . Wearing his number 10 shirt , Pelé produced one of the best performances of his career , scoring a hat-trick in Lisbon as Santos won 5–2 . As the defending champions , Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final stage of the 1963 Copa Libertadores . The ballet blanco , the nickname given to Santos for Pelé , managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors . Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that featured Brazilian greats such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in the first leg of the semi-finals which made it 1–1 . In the second leg , Pelé scored a hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos won , 0–4 , in the second leg . Santos started the final series by winning , 3–2 , in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2 , in La Bombonera . It was a rare feat in official competitions , with another goal from Pelé . Santos became the first ( and to date the only ) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil . Pelé finished the tournament with 5 goals . Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but went on to win the Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over Flamengo in the final , with Pelé scoring one goal . Pelé would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil against AC Milan and Bahia respectively . In the 1964 Copa Libertadores , Santos were beaten in both legs of the semi-finals by Independiente . The club won the Campeonato Paulista , with Pelé netting 34 goals . Santos also shared the Rio-São Paulo title with Botafogo and won the Taça Brasil for the fourth consecutive year . In the 1965 Copa Libertadores , Santos reached the semi-finals and met Peñarol in a rematch of the 1962 final . After two matches , a playoff was needed to break the tie . Unlike 1962 , Peñarol came out on top and eliminated Santos 2–1 . Pelé would , however , finish as the topscorer of the tournament with eight goals . This proved to be the start of a decline as Santos failed to retain the Torneio Rio-São Paulo . In 1966 , Pelé and Santos also failed to retain the Taça Brasil as Pelé \\'s goals were not enough to prevent a 9–4 defeat by Cruzeiro ( led by Tostão ) in the final series . The club did , however , win the Campeonato Paulista in 1967 , 1968 and 1969 . On 19 November 1969 , Pelé scored his 1,000th goal in all competitions , in what was a highly anticipated moment in Brazil . The goal , dubbed O Milésimo ( The Thousandth ) , occurred in a match against Vasco da Gama , when Pelé scored from a penalty kick , at the Maracanã Stadium . Pelé states that his most memorable goal was scored at Rua Javari stadium on a Campeonato Paulista match against São Paulo rival Clube Atlético Juventus on 2 August 1959 . As there is no video footage of this match , Pelé asked that a computer animation be made of this specific goal . In March 1961 , Pelé scored the gol de placa ( goal worthy of a plaque ) , against Fluminense at the Maracanã . Pelé received the ball on the edge of his own penalty area , and ran the length of the field , eluding opposition players with feints , before striking the ball beyond the goalkeeper . A plaque was commissioned with a dedication to \" the most beautiful goal in the history of the Maracanã \" . In 1969 , the two factions involved in the Nigerian Civil War agreed to a 48-hour ceasefire so they could watch Pelé play an exhibition game in Lagos . Santos ended up playing to a 2–2 draw with Lagos side Stationary Stores FC and Pelé scored his team \\'s goals . The civil war went on for one more year after this game . During his time at Santos , Pelé played alongside many gifted players , including Zito , Pepe , and Coutinho ; the latter partnered him in numerous one-two plays , attacks , and goals . Pelé \\'s 643 goals for Santos was the most goals scored for a single club until it was surpassed by Lionel Messi of Barcelona in December 2020 . New York Cosmos After the 1974 season ( his 19th with Santos ) , Pelé retired from Brazilian club football although he continued to occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches . Two years later , he came out of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League ( NASL ) for the 1975 season . At a chaotic press conference at New York \\'s 21 Club , the Cosmos unveiled Pelé . John O\\'Reilly , the club \\'s media spokesman , stated , \" We had superstars in the United States but nothing at the level of Pelé . Everyone wanted to touch him , shake his hand , get a photo with him . \" Though well past his prime at this point , Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the US . During his first public appearance in Boston , he was injured by a crowd of fans who had surrounded him and was evacuated on a stretcher . Pelé made his debut for the Cosmos on 15 June 1975 against the Dallas Tornado at Downing Stadium , scoring one goal in a 2–2 draw . Pelé opened the door for many other stars to play in North America . Giorgio Chinaglia followed him to the Cosmos , then Franz Beckenbauer and his former Santos teammate Carlos Alberto . Over the next few years other players came to the league , including Johan Cruyff , Eusebio , Bobby Moore , George Best and Gordon Banks . In 1975 , one week before the Lebanese Civil War , Pelé played a friendly game for the Lebanese club Nejmeh against a team of Lebanese Premier League stars , scoring two goals which were not included in his official tally . On the day of the game , 40,000 spectators were at the stadium from early morning to watch the match . He led the Cosmos to the 1977 NASL championship , in his third and final season with the club . In June 1977 , the Cosmos attracted an NASL record 62,394 fans to Giants Stadium for a 3–0 victory past the Tampa Bay Rowdies with a 37-year-old Pelé scoring a hat-trick . In the first leg of the quarter-finals , they attracted a US record crowd of 77,891 for what turned into an 8–3 rout of the Fort Lauderdale Strikers at Giants Stadium . In the second leg of the semi-finals against the Rochester Lancers , the Cosmos won 4–1 . Pelé finished his official playing career by leading the New York Cosmos to their first Soccer Bowl title with a 2–1 win over the Seattle Sounders at the Civic Stadium in Portland , Oregon . On 1 October 1977 , Pelé closed out his career in an exhibition match between the Cosmos and Santos . The match was played in front of a sold-out crowd at Giants Stadium and was televised in the US on ABC \\'s Wide World of Sports as well as throughout the world . Pelé \\'s father and wife both attended the match , as well as Muhammad Ali and Bobby Moore . Delivering a message to the audience prior to the start of the game— \" Love is more important than what we can take in life \" —Pelé played the first half with the Cosmos , the second with Santos . The game ended with the Cosmos winning 2–1 , with Pelé scoring with a 30-yard free-kick for the Cosmos in what was the final goal of his career . During the second half it started to rain , prompting a Brazilian newspaper to come out with the headline the following day : \" Even The Sky Was Crying . \" International career Pelé \\'s first international match was a 2–1 defeat against Argentina on 7 July 1957 at the Maracanã . In that match , he scored his first goal for Brazil aged 16 years and nine months , and he remains the youngest goalscorer for his country . 1958 World Cup Pelé arrived in Sweden sidelined by a knee injury but on his return from the treatment room , his colleagues stood together and insisted upon his selection . His first match was against the USSR in the third match of the first round of the 1958 FIFA World Cup , where he gave the assist to Vavá \\'s second goal . He was at the time the youngest player ever to participate in the World Cup . Against France in the semi-final , Brazil was leading 2–1 at halftime , and then Pelé scored a hat-trick , becoming the youngest in World Cup history to do so . On 29 June 1958 , Pelé became the youngest player to play in a World Cup final match at 17 years and 249 days . He scored two goals in that final as Brazil beat Sweden 5–2 in Stockholm , the capital . Pelé hit the post and then Vavá scored two goals to give Brazil the lead . His first goal where he flicked the ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net , was selected as one of the best goals in the history of the World Cup . Following Pelé \\'s second goal , Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment ; \" When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final , I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding \" . When the match ended , Pelé passed out on the field , and was revived by Garrincha . He then recovered , and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates . He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played , tied for second place , behind record-breaker Just Fontaine , and was named best young player of the tournament . His impact was arguably greater off the field , with Barney Ronay writing , \" With nothing but talent to guide him , the boy from Minas Gerais became the first black global sporting superstar , and a source of genuine uplift and inspiration . \" It was in the 1958 World Cup that Pelé began wearing a jersey with number 10 . The event was the result of disorganization : the leaders of the Brazilian Federation did not allocate the shirt numbers of players and it was up to FIFA to choose the number 10 shirt for Pelé who was a substitute on the occasion . The press proclaimed Pelé the greatest revelation of the 1958 World Cup , and he was also retroactively given the Silver Ball as the second best player of the tournament , behind Didi . South American Championship Pelé also played in the South American Championship . In the 1959 competition he was named best player of the tournament and was top scorer with 8 goals , as Brazil came second despite being unbeaten in the tournament . He scored in five of Brazil \\'s six games , including two goals against Chile and a hat-trick against Paraguay . 1962 World Cup When the 1962 World Cup started , Pelé was the best rated player in the world . In the first match of the 1962 World Cup in Chile , against Mexico , Pelé assisted the first goal and then scored the second one , after a run past four defenders , to go up 2–0 . He injured himself in the next game while attempting a long-range shot against Czechoslovakia . This would keep him out of the rest of the tournament , and forced coach Aymoré Moreira to make his only lineup change of the tournament . The substitute was Amarildo , who performed well for the rest of the tournament . However , it was Garrincha who would take the leading role and carry Brazil to their second World Cup title , after beating Czechoslovakia at the final in Santiago . 1966 World Cup Pelé was the most famous footballer in the world during the 1966 World Cup in England , and Brazil fielded some world champions like Garrincha , Gilmar and Djalma Santos with the addition of other stars like Jairzinho , Tostão and Gérson , leading to high expectations for them . Brazil was eliminated in the first round , playing only three matches . The World Cup was marked , among other things , for brutal fouls on Pelé that left him injured by the Bulgarian and Portuguese defenders . Pelé scored the first goal from a free kick against Bulgaria , becoming the first player to score in three successive FIFA World Cups , but due to his injury , a result of persistent fouling by the Bulgarians , he missed the second game against Hungary . His coach stated that after the first game he felt \" every team will take care of him in the same manner \" . Brazil lost that game and Pelé , although still recovering , was brought back for the last crucial match against Portugal at Goodison Park in Liverpool by the Brazilian coach Vicente Feola . Feola changed the entire defense , including the goalkeeper , while in midfield he returned to the formation of the first match . During the game , Portugal defender João Morais fouled Pelé , but was not sent off by referee George McCabe ; a decision retrospectively viewed as being among the worst refereeing errors in World Cup history . Pelé had to stay on the field limping for the rest of the game , since substitutes were not allowed at that time . After this game he vowed he would never again play in the World Cup , a decision he would later change . 1970 World Cup Pelé was called to the national team in early 1969 , he refused at first , but then accepted and played in six World Cup qualifying matches , scoring six goals . The 1970 World Cup in Mexico was expected to be Pelé \\'s last . Brazil \\'s squad for the tournament featured major changes in relation to the 1966 squad . Players like Garrincha , Nilton Santos , Valdir Pereira , Djalma Santos and Gilmar had already retired . However , Brazil \\'s 1970 World Cup squad , which included players like Pelé , Rivelino , Jairzinho , Gérson , Carlos Alberto Torres , Tostão and Clodoaldo , is often considered to be the greatest football team in history . The front five of Jairzinho , Pelé , Gerson , Tostão and Rivelino together created an attacking momentum , with Pelé having a central role in Brazil \\'s way to the final . All of Brazil \\'s matches in the tournament ( except the final ) were played in Guadalajara , and in the first match against Czechoslovakia , Pelé gave Brazil a 2–1 lead , by controlling Gerson \\'s long pass with his chest and then scoring . In this match Pelé attempted to lob goalkeeper Ivo Viktor from the half-way line , only narrowly missing the Czechoslovak goal . Brazil went on to win the match , 4–1 . In the first half of the match against England , Pelé nearly scored with a header that was saved by the England goalkeeper Gordon Banks . Pelé recalled he was already shouting \" Goal \" when he headed the ball . It was often referred to as the \" save of the century . \" In the second half , he controlled a cross from Tostão before flicking the ball to Jairzinho who scored the only goal . Against Romania , Pelé scored two goals , which included a 20-yard bending free-kick , with Brazil winning 3–2 . In the quarter-final against Peru , Brazil won 4–2 , with Pelé assisting Tostão for Brazil \\'s third goal . In the semi-final , Brazil faced Uruguay for the first time since the 1950 World Cup final round match . Jairzinho put Brazil ahead 2–1 , and Pelé assisted Rivelino for the 3–1 . During that match , Pelé made one of his most famous plays . Tostão passed the ball for Pelé to collect which Uruguay \\'s goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz took notice of and ran off his line to get the ball before Pelé . However , Pelé got there first and fooled Mazurkiewicz with a feint by not touching the ball , causing it to roll to the goalkeepers left , while Pelé went to the goalkeepers right . Pelé ran around the goalkeeper to retrieve the ball and took a shot while turning towards the goal , but he turned in excess as he shot , and the ball drifted just wide of the far post . Brazil played Italy in the final at the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City . Pelé scored the opening goal with a header after outjumping Italian defender Tarcisio Burgnich . Brazil \\'s 100th World Cup goal , Pelé \\'s leap of joy into the arms of teammate Jairzinho in celebrating the goal is regarded as one of the most iconic moments in World Cup history . He then made assists for Brazil \\'s third goal , scored by Jairzinho , and the fourth finished by Carlos Alberto . The last goal of the game is often considered the greatest team goal of all time because it involved all but two of the team \\'s outfield players . The play culminated after Pelé made a blind pass that went into Carlos Alberto \\'s running trajectory . He came running from behind and struck the ball to score . Brazil won the match 4–1 , keeping the Jules Rimet Trophy indefinitely , and Pelé received the Golden Ball as player of the tournament . Burgnich , who marked Pelé during the final , was quoted saying \" I told myself before the game , he \\'s made of skin and bones just like everyone else – but I was wrong \" . In terms of his goals and assist throughout the 1970 World Cup , Pelé was directly responsible for 53 % of Brazil \\'s goals throughout the tournament . Pelé \\'s last international match was on 18 July 1971 against Yugoslavia in Rio de Janeiro . With Pelé on the field , the Brazilian team \\'s record was 67 wins , 14 draws and 11 losses . Brazil never lost a match while fielding both Pelé and Garrincha . Style of play Pelé has also been known for connecting the phrase \" The Beautiful Game \" with football . A prolific goalscorer , he was known for his ability to anticipate opponents in the area and finish off chances with an accurate and powerful shot with either foot . Pelé was also a hard-working team player , and a complete forward , with exceptional vision and intelligence , who was recognised for his precise passing and ability to link up with teammates and provide them with assists . In his early career , he played in a variety of attacking positions . Although he usually operated inside the penalty area as a main striker or centre forward , his wide range of skills also allowed him to play in a more withdrawn role , as an inside forward or second striker , or out wide . In his later career , he took on more of a deeper playmaking role behind the strikers , often functioning as an attacking midfielder . Pelé \\'s unique playing style combined speed , creativity , and technical skill with physical power , stamina , and athleticism . His excellent technique , balance , flair , agility , and dribbling skills enabled him to beat opponents with the ball , and frequently saw him use sudden changes of direction and elaborate feints in order to get past players , such as his trademark move , the drible da vaca . Another one of his signature moves was the paradinha , or little stop . Despite his relatively small stature , , he excelled in the air , due to his heading accuracy , timing , and elevation . Renowned for his bending shots , he was also an accurate free-kick taker , and penalty taker , although he often refrained from taking penalties , stating that he believed it to be a cowardly way to score . Pelé was also known to be a fair and highly influential player , who stood out for his charismatic leadership and sportsmanship on the pitch . His warm embrace of Bobby Moore following the Brazil vs England game at the 1970 World Cup is viewed as the embodiment of sportsmanship , with The New York Times stating the image \" captured the respect that two great players had for each other . As they exchanged jerseys , touches and looks , the sportsmanship between them is all in the image . No gloating , no fist-pumping from Pelé . No despair , no defeatism from Bobby Moore . \" Pelé also earned a reputation for often being a decisive player for his teams , due to his tendency to score crucial goals in important matches . Reception and legacy Among the most successful and popular sports figures of the 20th century , Pelé is one of the most lauded players in the history of football and has been frequently ranked the best player ever . Among his contemporaries , Dutch star Johan Cruyff stated ; \" Pelé was the only footballer who surpassed the boundaries of logic . \" Brazil \\'s 1970 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Carlos Alberto Torres opined ; \" His great secret was improvisation . Those things he did were in one moment . He had an extraordinary perception of the game . \" Tostão , his strike partner at the 1970 World Cup ; \" Pelé was the greatest – he was simply flawless . And off the pitch he is always smiling and upbeat . You never see him bad-tempered . He loves being Pelé . \" His Brazilian teammate Clodoaldo commented on the adulation he witnessed ; \" In some countries they wanted to touch him , in some they wanted to kiss him . In others they even kissed the ground he walked on . I thought it was beautiful , just beautiful . \" Former Real Madrid and Hungary star Ferenc Puskás stated ; \" The greatest player in history was Di Stéfano . I refuse to classify Pelé as a player . He was above that . \" Just Fontaine , French striker and leading scorer at the 1958 World Cup ; \" When I saw Pelé play , it made me feel I should hang up my boots . \" England \\'s 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore commented : \" Pelé was the most complete player I \\'ve ever seen , he had everything . Two good feet . Magic in the air . Quick . Powerful . Could beat people with skill . Could outrun people . Only five feet and eight inches tall , yet he seemed a giant of an athlete on the pitch . Perfect balance and impossible vision . He was the greatest because he could do anything and everything on a football pitch . I remember Saldanha the coach being asked by a Brazilian journalist who was the best goalkeeper in his squad . He said Pelé . The man could play in any position \" . Former Manchester United striker and member of England \\'s 1966 FIFA World Cup-winning team Sir Bobby Charlton stated ; \" I sometimes feel as though football was invented for this magical player . \" During the 1970 World Cup , when Manchester United defender Paddy Crerand ( who was part of the ITV panel ) was asked ; \" How do you spell Pelé ? \" , he replied with the response ; \" Easy : G-O-D . \" Accolades Since retiring , Pelé has continued to be lauded by players , coaches , journalists and others . Brazilian attacking midfielder Zico , who represented Brazil at the 1978 , 1982 and 1986 FIFA World Cup , stated ; \" This debate about the player of the century is absurd . There \\'s only one possible answer : Pelé . He \\'s the greatest player of all time , and by some distance I might add \" . French three time Ballon d\\'Or winner Michel Platini said ; \" There \\'s Pelé the man , and then Pelé the player . And to play like Pelé is to play like God . \" Diego Maradona , joint FIFA Player of the Century , and the player Pelé is historically compared with , stated ; \" It \\'s too bad we never got along , but he was an awesome player \" . Prolific Brazilian striker Romário , winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and player of the tournament ; \" It \\'s only inevitable I look up to Pelé . He \\'s like a God to us \" . Five-time FIFA Ballon d\\'Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo said : \" Pelé is the greatest player in football history , and there will only be one Pelé \" , while José Mourinho , two-time UEFA Champions League winning manager , commented ; \" I think he is football . You have the real special one – Mr . Pelé . \" Real Madrid honorary president and former player , Alfredo Di Stéfano , opined : \" The best player ever ? Pelé . Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are both great players with specific qualities , but Pelé was better \" . Presenting Pelé the Laureus Lifetime Achievement Award , former South African president Nelson Mandela said ; \" To watch him play was to watch the delight of a child combined with the extraordinary grace of a man in full . \" US politician and political scientist Henry Kissinger stated , \" Performance at a high level in any sport is to exceed the ordinary human scale . But Pelé \\'s performance transcended that of the ordinary star by as much as the star exceeds ordinary performance . \" After a reporter asked if his fame compared to that of Jesus , Pelé quipped , \" There are parts of the world where Jesus Christ is not so well known . \" The artist Andy Warhol ( who painted a portrait of Pelé ) also quipped , \" Pelé was one of the few who contradicted my theory : instead of 15 minutes of fame , he will have 15 centuries . \" In 2000 , the International Federation of Football History & Statistics ( IFFHS ) voted Pelé the World Player of the Century . In 1999 , the International Olympic Committee elected him the Athlete of the Century and Time magazine named Pelé one of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century . During his playing days , Pelé was for a period the highest-paid athlete in the world . Pelé \\'s \" electrifying play and penchant for spectacular goals \" made him a star around the world . To take full advantage of his popularity , his teams toured internationally . During his career , he became known as \" The Black Pearl \" ( A Pérola Negra ) , \" The King of Football \" ( O Rei do Futebol ) , \" The King Pelé \" ( O Rei Pelé ) or simply \" The King \" ( O Rei ) . In 2014 , the city of Santos inaugurated the Pelé museum – Museu Pelé – which displays a 2,400 piece collection of Pelé memorabilia . Approximately $ 22 million was invested in the construction of the museum , housed in a 19th-century mansion . In January 2014 , Pelé was awarded the first ever FIFA Ballon d\\'Or Prix d\\'Honneur as an acknowledgment from the world governing body of the sport for his contribution to world football . After changing the rules in 1995 , France Football did an extensive analysis in 2015 of the players who would have won the award if it was open for them since 1956—the year the Ballon d\\'Or award started . Their study revealed that Pelé would have received the award a record seven times ( Ballon d\\'or : Le nouveau palmarès ) . The original recipients , however , remain unchanged . In 2020 , Pelé was named in the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team , a greatest all-time XI . According to the RSSSF , Pelé is one of the most successful goal-scorers in the world , scoring 538 league goals , a total of 775 in 840 official games and a tally of 1,301 goals in 1,390 appearances during his professional senior career , which included friendlies and tour games . He \\'s ranked among the leading scorer in football history in both official and total matches . After his retirement in 1977 he played eight exhibition games and scored three goals . Personal life Relationships and children Pelé has married three times , and has had several affairs , producing several children . On 21 February 1966 , Pelé married Rosemeri dos Reis Cholbi . They had two daughters and one son : Kelly Cristina ( born 13 January 1967 ) , who married Dr . Arthur DeLuca , Jennifer ( b . 1978 ) , and their son Edson ( \" Edinho \" , b . 27 August 1970 ) . The couple divorced in 1982 . In May 2014 , Edinho was jailed for 33 years for laundering money from drug trafficking . On appeal the sentence was reduced to 12 years and 10 months . From 1981 to 1986 , Pelé was romantically linked with TV presenter Xuxa , which was influential in launching her career . She was 17 when they started dating . In April 1994 , Pelé married psychologist and gospel singer Assíria Lemos Seixas , who gave birth on 28 September 1996 to twins Joshua and Celeste through fertility treatments . The couple divorced in 2008 . Pelé had at least two more children from former affairs . Sandra Machado , who was born from an affair Pelé had in 1964 with a housemaid , Anizia Machado , fought for years to be acknowledged by Pelé , who refused to submit to DNA tests . Although she was recognised by courts as his biological daughter based on DNA evidence in 1993 , Pelé never acknowledged his eldest daughter even after her death in 2006 , nor her two children , Octavio and Gabriel . Pelé also had another daughter , Flávia Kurtz , in an extramarital affair in 1968 with journalist Lenita Kurtz . Flávia was recognised by him as his daughter . At the age of 73 , Pelé announced his intention to marry 41-year-old Marcia Aoki , a Japanese-Brazilian importer of medical equipment from Penápolis , São Paulo , whom he had been dating from 2010 . They first met in the mid-1980s in New York , before meeting again in 2008 . They married in July 2016 . Politics In 1970 , Pelé was investigated by the Brazilian military dictatorship for suspected leftist sympathies . Declassified documents showed Pelé was investigated after being handed a manifesto calling for the release of political prisoners . Pelé himself did not get further involved within political struggles in the country . In 1976 , Pelé was on a Pepsi-sponsored trip in Lagos , Nigeria , when that year \\'s attempted military coup took place . Pelé was trapped in a hotel together with Arthur Ashe and other tennis pros , who were participating in the interrupted 1976 Lagos WCT tournament . Pelé and his crew eventually left the hotel to stay at the residence of Brazil \\'s ambassador as they could not leave the country for a couple of days . Later the airport was opened and Pelé left the country disguised as a pilot . In June 2013 , he was criticised in public opinion for his conservative views . During the 2013 protests in Brazil , Pelé asked for people to \" forget the demonstrations \" and support the Brazil national team . Health In 1977 , Brazilian media reported that Pelé had his right kidney removed . In November 2012 , Pelé underwent a successful hip operation . In December 2017 , Pelé appeared in a wheelchair at the 2018 World Cup draw in Moscow where he was pictured with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Diego Maradona . A month later he collapsed from exhaustion and was taken to hospital . In 2019 , after a hospitalisation because of a urinary tract infection , Pelé underwent surgery to remove kidney stones . In February 2020 , his son Edinho reported that Pelé was unable to walk independently and reluctant to leave home , ascribing his condition to a lack of rehabilitation following his hip operation . In September 2021 , Pelé had surgery to remove a tumour on the right side of his colon . Although his eldest daughter Kely stated he was \" doing well \" , he was reportedly readmitted to intensive care a few days later , before finally being released on 30 September 2021 to begin chemotherapy . Public image Pelé is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person . After football In 1994 , Pelé was appointed a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador . In 1995 , Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso appointed Pelé to the position of Extraordinary Minister for Sport . During this time he proposed legislation to reduce corruption in Brazilian football , which became known as the \" Pelé law . \" The Brazilian President had eliminated the post of Sports Minister in 1998 . In 2001 Pelé was accused of involvement in a corruption scandal that stole $ 700,000 from UNICEF . It was claimed that money given to Pelé \\'s company for a benefit match was not returned after it was cancelled , although nothing was proven , and it was denied by UNICEF . In 1997 , he received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II at a ceremony in Buckingham Palace . Pelé also helped inaugurate the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals , alongside supermodel Claudia Schiffer . In 1993 , Pelé publicly accused the Brazilian football administrator Ricardo Teixeira of corruption after Pelé \\'s television company was rejected in a contest for the Brazilian domestic rights to the 1994 World Cup . Pelé \\'s accusations led to an eight-year feud between the pair . As a consequence of the affair , the President of FIFA , João Havelange , banned Pelé from the draw for the 1994 FIFA World Cup in Las Vegas . Criticisms over the ban were perceived to have damaged Havelange \\'s chances of re-election as FIFA \\'s president in 1994 . Pelé has published several autobiographies , starred in documentary films , and composed musical pieces , including the soundtrack for the film Pelé in 1977 . He appeared in the 1981 film Escape to Victory , about a World War II-era football match between Allied prisoners of war and a German team . Pelé starred alongside other footballers of the 1960s and 1970s , with actors Michael Caine and Sylvester Stallone . in 1969 , Pelé starred in a telenovela called Os Estranhos , about first contact with aliens . It was created to drum up interest in the Apollo missions . In 2001 , had a cameo role in the satire film Mike Bassett : England Manager . Pelé was asked to participate in the 2006 ESPN documentary film Once in a Lifetime : The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos , but declined when the producers refused to pay his requested $ 100,000 fee . In November 2007 , Pelé was in Sheffield , England , to mark the 150th anniversary of the world \\'s oldest football club , Sheffield F.C . Pelé was the guest of honour at Sheffield \\'s anniversary match against Inter Milan at Bramall Lane . As part of his visit , Pelé opened an exhibition which included the first public showing in 40 years of the original hand-written rules of football . Pelé scouted for Premier League club Fulham in 2002 . He made the draw for the qualification groups for the 2006 FIFA World Cup finals . On 1 August 2010 , Pelé was introduced as the Honorary President of a revived New York Cosmos , aiming to field a team in Major League Soccer . In August 2011 , ESPN reported that Santos were considering bringing him out of retirement for a cameo role in the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup , although this turned out to be false . The most notable area of Pelé \\'s life since football is his ambassadorial work . In 1992 , he was appointed a UN ambassador for ecology and the environment . He was also awarded Brazil \\'s gold medal for outstanding services to the sport in 1995 . In 2012 , Pelé was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Edinburgh for \" significant contribution to humanitarian and environmental causes , as well as his sporting achievements \" . In 2009 , Pelé assisted the Rio de Janeiro bid for the 2016 Summer Olympics . In July 2009 he spearheaded the Rio 2016 presentation to the Association of National Olympic Committees of Africa General Assembly in Abuja , Nigeria . On 12 August 2012 , Pelé was an attendee at the 2012 Olympic hunger summit hosted by UK Prime Minister David Cameron at 10 Downing Street , London , part of a series of international efforts which have sought to respond to the return of hunger as a high-profile global issue . Later on the same day , Pelé appeared at the closing ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London , following the handover section to the next host city for the 2016 Summer Olympics , Rio de Janeiro . In March 2016 , Pelé filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois seeking US $ 30 million in damages claiming violations under the Lanham Act for false endorsement and a state law claim for violation of his right of publicity . The suit alleged that at one point , Samsung and Pelé came close to entering into a licensing agreement for Pelé to appear in a Samsung advertising campaign . Samsung abruptly pulled out of the negotiations . The October 2015 Samsung ad in question included a partial face shot of a man who allegedly \" very closely resembles \" Pelé and also a superimposed high-definition television screen next to the image of the man featuring a \" modified bicycle or scissors-kick \" , often used by Pelé .

The award was originally intended to be based upon votes in a web poll , but after it became apparent that it favoured Diego Maradona , many observers complained that the Internet nature of the poll would have meant a skewed demographic of younger fans who would have seen Maradona play , but not Pelé . FIFA then appointed a \" Family of Football \" committee of FIFA members to decide the winner of the award together with the votes of the readers of the FIFA magazine . The committee chose Pelé . Since Maradona was winning the Internet poll , however , it was decided he and Pelé should share the award .

It has a seating capacity of 50,033 , making it the third largest football stadium in Portugal . Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado , the stadium was constructed to replace Porto 's former ground , the Estádio das Antas , along with becoming one of the host venues for the UEFA Euro 2004 final tournament . The inauguration took place on 16 November 2003 with a friendly match against Barcelona , setting an attendance record of 52,000 spectators . A UEFA category four stadium , it has held several international club and national team competition matches , including the 2019 UEFA Nations League Final and 2021 UEFA Champions League Final . Construction and inauguration Construction works began in late 2001 , and were completed in November 2003 , some months after what was expected , since in February 2002 , Porto mayor Rui Rio changed the estate distribution , criticizing the plan for including high-scale housing and shopping for the area . These actions forced the chairman of FC Porto , Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa , to halt all building operations , which were only resumed after a consensus was reached . Designed by Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado and built by Portuguese contractor Somague , it cost €97,755,318 , of which €18,430,956 was subsidized by the government . To help underwrite costs , each stand carries one or two sponsor names : Super Bock ( south ) , tmn ( east ) , meo ( west ) , and Coca-Cola ( north stand ) . Away fans are placed in the right corner of the upper tier of the east stand , while home Ultra groups , Super Dragões and Colectivo Ultras 95 , occupy the south stand and the north stand , respectively , like on the old stadium . The stadium was inaugurated on November 16 , 2003 , with a match against FC Barcelona , which featured the debut of a 16-year-old Lionel Messi in the Spanish side . Porto won 2–0 with goals by Derlei and Hugo Almeida . Due to severe turf problems , however , Porto was forced to return and play in the old Estádio das Antas , until the turf was replanted by mid-February 2004 . The stadium is characterized by a frame of 21 000 m2 of azulejos . Naming Prior to the inauguration , the stadium 's name was debated internally between elements of Porto 's administration , with various alternatives in consideration , such as retaining the old name , Estádio das Antas ( officially , unlike the former stadium ) , or name it after some of the club 's biggest historical figures like former player Artur de Sousa Pinga , manager José Maria Pedroto or president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa , the latter being , the one with most gathered consensus but ended dismissed by the president himself . After a deliberation period , the name Estádio do Dragão was revealed to the general public . International matches Portugal national team matches The following national team matches were held in the stadium . UEFA Euro 2004 Constructed to become one of the venues of the UEFA Euro 2004 tournament , it staged the inaugural match between hosts Portugal and eventual winners Greece , as well as three group stage , one quarterfinal , and one semifinal fixtures . 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals One of the venues of the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals . 2021 UEFA Champions League Final The final originally planned at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul , but was moved due to travel restrictions by England government caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey , the final hosts were shifted back a two-year , with Istanbul instead hosting the 2023 final . Other uses A major source of income granted by the infrastructure is the planned capability to monetize on organizing events outside of regular football matches . Those extend from business meetings , congresses , summits , festivals , expos and other sports competitions . For example , the ROC committee picked the stadium to host the 2009 Race of Champions South Europe Regional Final , therefore , the grass pitch was converted into an asphalt course in order to accommodate the race . The 2019 ESSMA Summit is also noteworthy by having joined several clubs , leagues and federations representatives together at the venue to discuss matters on the developments and trends of the football industry . In addition , through different music promoters and specialized event management companies , the stadium already served as a concert venue to four international tour schedules from recognized musical artists along with selected opening acts . Access and transportation Access by vehicle is possible through the VCI ( Via de Cintura Interna ) , a roadway that passes right next to the stadium , granting a direct connection . In the event of coming from the city center , driving down the main Alameda da Antas is another viable route towards the destination . In spite of this , the recommendation is the use of the public transports , which results in a better flux of public movement around the perimeter . Having its own station combined with the infrastructure , the metro functions as the main way of reaching the stadium , with different lines linking the various city areas and a direct connection to the international Francisco Sá Carneiro Airport . Alternatively , the STCP bus service also grants routes for the purpose and there are 150 bicycle parking spots available . In popular media The stadium was relicensed in FIFA 22 and returned to EA Sports prominent video game franchise .

Often described as one of the preeminent actors of his generation , he received numerous accolades throughout his career which spanned over four decades , including three Academy Awards for Best Actor , making him the first and only actor to have three wins in that category , and the third male actor to win three competitive Academy Awards for acting , the sixth performer overall . Additionally , he has received two Golden Globe Awards , three Screen Actors Guild Awards and four British Academy Film Awards . In 2014 , Day-Lewis received a knighthood for services to drama . Born and raised in London , Day-Lewis excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre before being accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years . Despite his traditional training at the Bristol Old Vic , he is considered a method actor , known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles . Displaying a \" mercurial intensity \" , he would often remain completely in character throughout the shooting schedules of his films , even to the point of adversely affecting his health . He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry , having starred in only six films since 1998 , with as many as five years between roles . Protective of his private life , he rarely grants interviews , and makes very few public appearances . Day-Lewis shifted between theatre and film for most of the early 1980s , joining the Royal Shakespeare Company and playing Romeo Montague in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night \\'s Dream . Playing the title role in Hamlet at the National Theatre in London in 1989 , he left the stage midway through a performance after breaking down during a scene where the ghost of Hamlet \\'s father appears before him—this was his last appearance on the stage . In 1984 , he appeared in The Bounty before gaining critical attention for his performances in Stephen Frears \\' My Beautiful Laundrette ( 1985 ) and James Ivory \\'s A Room with a View ( 1986 ) . He then assumed leading man status in Philip Kaufman \\'s The Unbearable Lightness of Being ( 1988 ) , My Left Foot ( 1989 ) , receiving his first Academy Award and British Academy Film Award for Best Actor , Michael Mann \\'s historical war film The Last of the Mohicans ( 1992 ) , Jim Sheridan \\'s courtroom drama In the Name of the Father ( 1993 ) and Martin Scorsese \\'s period romance The Age of Innocence ( 1993 ) . Following his performance in The Boxer ( 1997 ) , Day-Lewis retired from acting for three years , taking up a new profession as an apprentice shoe-maker in Italy . He returned to acting in 2000 , reuniting with Scorsese in the historical crime film Gangs of New York ( 2002 ) , winning a British Academy Film Award and receiving an Academy Award nomination . He won the Academy Award and British Academy Film Award for Best Actor for Paul Thomas Anderson \\'s period drama There Will Be Blood ( 2007 ) and Steven Spielberg \\'s biographical drama Lincoln ( 2012 ) . After a decade , Day-Lewis reunited with Anderson for Phantom Thread ( 2017 ) , for which he was also nominated for an Academy Award . He then announced his retirement following the completion of the film . Early life and education Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis was born on 29 April 1957 in the Kensington district of London , the second child of poet Cecil Day-Lewis ( 1904–1972 ) and his second wife , actress Jill Balcon ( 1925–2009 ) . His older sister , Tamasin Day-Lewis ( born 1953 ) , is a television chef and food critic . His father , who was born in the Irish town of Ballintubbert , County Laois , was of Protestant Anglo-Irish descent , lived in England from age two , and was appointed Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom . Day-Lewis \\'s mother was Jewish ; her Jewish ancestors were immigrants to England in the late 19th century , from Latvia and Poland . Day-Lewis \\'s maternal grandfather , Sir Michael Balcon , became the head of Ealing Studios , helping develop the new British film industry . The BAFTA for Outstanding Contribution to British Cinema is presented every year in honour of Balcon \\'s memory . Two years after Day-Lewis \\'s birth , he moved with his family to Crooms Hill in Greenwich via Port Clarence , County Durham . He and his older sister did not see much of their older two half-brothers , who had been teenagers when Day-Lewis \\'s father divorced their mother . Living in Greenwich ( he attended Invicta and Sherington Primary Schools ) , Day-Lewis had to deal with tough South London children . At this school , he was bullied for being both Jewish and \" posh \" . He mastered the local accent and mannerisms , and credits that as being his first convincing performance . Later in life , he has been known to speak of himself as a disorderly character in his younger years , often in trouble for shoplifting and other petty crimes . In 1968 , Day-Lewis \\'s parents , finding his behaviour to be too wild , sent him as a boarder to the independent Sevenoaks School in Kent . At the school , he was introduced to his three most prominent interests : woodworking , acting , and fishing . However , his disdain for the school grew , and after two years at Sevenoaks , he was transferred to another independent school , Bedales in Petersfield , Hampshire . His sister was already a student there , and it had a more relaxed and creative ethos . He made his film debut at age 14 in Sunday Bloody Sunday , in which he played a vandal in an uncredited role . He described the experience as \" heaven \" for getting paid £2 to vandalise expensive cars parked outside his local church . For a few weeks in 1972 , the Day-Lewis family lived at Lemmons , the north London home of Kingsley Amis and Elizabeth Jane Howard . Day-Lewis \\'s father had pancreatic cancer , and Howard invited the family to Lemmons as a place they could use to rest and recuperate . His father died there in May that year . By the time he left Bedales in 1975 , Day-Lewis \\'s unruly attitude had diminished and he needed to make a career choice . Although he had excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre in London , he applied for a five-year apprenticeship as a cabinet-maker . He was turned down due to lack of experience . He was accepted at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School , which he attended for three years along with Miranda Richardson , eventually performing at the Bristol Old Vic itself . At one point he played understudy to Pete Postlethwaite , with whom he would later co-star in the film In the Name of the Father ( 1994 ) . John Hartoch , Day-Lewis \\'s acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic , recalled : Career 1980s During the early 1980s , Day-Lewis worked in theatre and television , including Frost in May ( where he played an impotent man-child ) and How Many Miles to Babylon ? ( as a World War I officer torn between allegiances to Britain and Ireland ) for the BBC . Eleven years after his film debut , Day-Lewis had a small part in the film Gandhi ( 1982 ) as Colin , a South African street thug who racially bullies the title character . In late 1982 , he had his big theatre break when he took over the lead in Another Country , which had premiered in late 1981 . Next , he took on a supporting role as the conflicted , but ultimately loyal , first mate in The Bounty ( 1984 ) . He next joined the Royal Shakespeare Company , playing Romeo in Romeo and Juliet and Flute in A Midsummer Night \\'s Dream . In 1985 , Day-Lewis gave his first critically acclaimed performance playing a young gay English man in an interracial relationship with a Pakistani youth in the film My Beautiful Laundrette . Directed by Stephen Frears , and written by Hanif Kureishi , the film is set in 1980s London during Margaret Thatcher \\'s tenure as Prime Minister . It is the first of three Day-Lewis films to appear in the BFI \\'s 100 greatest British films of the 20th century , ranking 50th . Day-Lewis gained further public notice that year with A Room with a View ( 1985 ) , based on the novel by E . M . Forster . Set in the Edwardian period of turn-of-the-20th-century England , he portrayed an entirely different character : Cecil Vyse , the proper upper-class fiancé of the main character . In 1987 , Day-Lewis assumed leading man status by starring in Philip Kaufman \\'s adaptation of Milan Kundera \\'s The Unbearable Lightness of Being , in which he portrayed a Czech surgeon whose hyperactive sex life is thrown into disarray when he allows himself to become emotionally involved with a woman . During the eight-month shoot , he learned Czech , and first began to refuse to break character on or off the set for the entire shooting schedule . During this period , Day-Lewis was regarded as \" one of Britain ’ s most exciting young actors \" . He and other young British actors of the time , such as Gary Oldman , Colin Firth , Tim Roth , and Bruce Payne , were dubbed the \" Brit Pack \" . Day-Lewis progressed his personal version of method acting in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan \\'s My Left Foot . It won him numerous awards , including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor . Brown , known as a writer and painter , was born with cerebral palsy , and was able to control only his left foot . Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin , where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities , some of whom had no speech . During filming , he again refused to break character . Playing a severely paralysed character on screen , off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair , and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires , all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown \\'s life , including the embarrassments . Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him . It was rumoured that he had broken two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks , something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival . Day-Lewis returned to the stage in 1989 to work with Richard Eyre , as the title character in Hamlet at the National Theatre , London , but during a performance collapsed during the scene where the ghost of Hamlet \\'s father appears before him . He began sobbing uncontrollably , and refused to go back on stage ; he was replaced by Jeremy Northam , who gave a triumphant performance . Ian Charleson formally replaced Day-Lewis for the rest of the run . Earlier in the run , Day-Lewis had talked of the \" demons \" in the role , and for weeks he threw himself passionately into the part . Although the incident was officially attributed to exhaustion , Day-Lewis claimed to have seen the ghost of his own father . He later explained that this was more of a metaphor than a hallucination . \" To some extent I probably saw my father ’ s ghost every night , because of course if you ’ re working in a play like Hamlet , you explore everything through your own experience . \" He has not appeared on stage since . The media attention following his breakdown on-stage contributed to his decision to eventually move from England to Ireland in the mid-1990s , to regain a sense of privacy amidst his increasing fame . 1990s Day-Lewis starred in the American film The Last of the Mohicans ( 1992 ) , based on a novel by James Fenimore Cooper . Day-Lewis \\'s character research for this film was well-publicised ; he reportedly underwent rigorous weight training , and learned to live off the land and forest where his character lived , camping , hunting , and fishing . Day-Lewis also added to his wood-working skills , and learned how to make canoes . He carried a long rifle at all times during filming to remain in character . He returned to work with Jim Sheridan on In the Name of the Father in which he played Gerry Conlon , one of the Guildford Four , who were wrongfully convicted of a bombing carried out by the Provisional IRA . He lost 2st 2 lb ( 30 lb or 14 kg ) for the part , kept his Northern Irish accent on and off the set for the entire shooting schedule , and spent stretches of time in a prison cell . He insisted that crew members throw cold water at him and verbally abuse him . Starring opposite Emma Thompson ( who played his lawyer Gareth Peirce ) , and Pete Postlethwaite , Day-Lewis earned his second Academy Award nomination , third BAFTA nomination , and second Golden Globe nomination . Day-Lewis returned to the US in 1993 , playing Newland Archer in Martin Scorsese \\'s adaptation of the Edith Wharton novel The Age of Innocence . Day-Lewis starred opposite Michelle Pfeiffer , and Winona Ryder . To prepare for the film , set in America \\'s Gilded Age , he wore 1870s-period aristocratic clothing around New York City for two months , including top hat , cane , and cape . Although Day-Lewis was sceptical of the role , deeming himself \" too English \" for it , he accepted due to Scorsese directing the film . The film was critically well received , while Peter Travers in Rolling Stone wrote : \" Day-Lewis is smashing as the man caught between his emotions and the social ethic . Not since Olivier in Wuthering Heights has an actor matched piercing intelligence with such imposing good looks and physical grace . \" In 1996 , Day-Lewis starred in the film adaptation of Arthur Miller \\'s play , The Crucible reunited with Winona Ryder , and starring alongside Paul Scofield , and Joan Allen . During the shoot , he met his future wife , Rebecca Miller , the author \\'s daughter . Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a grade of \" A \" , calling the adaptation \" joltingly powerful \" and noting the \" spectacularly \" acted performances of Day-Lewis , Scofield , and Allen . He followed that with Jim Sheridan \\'s The Boxer alongside Emily Watson , starring as a former boxer and IRA member recently released from prison . His preparation included training with former boxing world champion Barry McGuigan . Immersing himself into the boxing scene , he watched \" Prince \" Naseem Hamed train , and attended professional boxing matches such as the Nigel Benn vs . Gerald McClellan world title fight at London Arena . Impressed with his work in the ring , McGuigan felt Day-Lewis could have become a professional boxer , commenting , \" If you eliminate the top ten middleweights in Britain , any of the other guys Daniel could have gone in and fought . \" Following The Boxer , Day-Lewis took a leave of absence from acting by going into \" semi-retirement \" and returning to his old passion of wood-working . He moved to Florence , Italy , where he became intrigued by the craft of shoe-making . He apprenticed as a shoe-maker with Stefano Bemer . For a time , his exact whereabouts and actions were not made publicly known . 2000s After a three-year absence from acting on screen , Day-Lewis returned to film by reuniting with Martin Scorsese for Gangs of New York ( 2002 ) . He took on the role of villainous gang leader William \" Bill the Butcher \" Cutting , starring opposite Leonardo DiCaprio , who played Bill \\'s young protégé as well as Cameron Diaz , Jim Broadbent , John C . Reilly , Brendan Gleeson , and Liam Neeson . To help him get into character , he hired circus performers to teach him to throw knives . While filming , he was never out of character between takes ( including keeping his character \\'s New York accent ) . At one point during filming , having been diagnosed with pneumonia , he refused to wear a warmer coat , or to take treatment , because it was not in keeping with the period ; he was eventually persuaded to seek medical treatment . The film divided critics while Day-Lewis received plaudits for his portrayal of Bill the Butcher . Rotten Tomatoes \\'s critical consensus reads , \" Though flawed , the sprawling , messy Gangs of New York is redeemed by impressive production design and Day-Lewis \\'s electrifying performance . \" It earned Day-Lewis his third Oscar nomination , and won him his second BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . After Gangs of New York , Day-Lewis \\'s wife , director Rebecca Miller , offered him the lead role in her film The Ballad of Jack and Rose , in which he played a dying man with regrets over how his life had evolved , and over how he had brought up his teenage daughter . While filming , he arranged to live separately from his wife to achieve the \" isolation \" needed to focus on his own character \\'s reality . The film received mixed reviews . In 2007 , Day-Lewis starred alongside Paul Dano in Paul Thomas Anderson \\'s loose film adaptation of Upton Sinclair \\'s novel Oil ! , titled There Will Be Blood . The film received widespread critical acclaim , with critic Andrew Sarris calling the film \" an impressive achievement in its confident expertness in rendering the simulated realities of a bygone time and place , largely with an inspired use of regional amateur actors and extras with all the right moves and sounds . \" Day-Lewis received the Academy Award for Best Actor , BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role , Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama , Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role ( which he dedicated to Heath Ledger , who had died five days earlier , saying he was inspired by Ledger \\'s acting and calling the actor \\'s performance in Brokeback Mountain \" unique , perfect \" ) , and a variety of film critics \\' circle awards for the role . In winning the Best Actor Oscar , Day-Lewis joined Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson as the only Best Actor winner awarded an Oscar in two non-consecutive decades . In 2009 , Day-Lewis starred in Rob Marshall \\'s musical adaptation Nine as film director Guido Contini . The film featured a large ensemble of distinguished actresses , including Marion Cotillard , Penélope Cruz , Judi Dench , Nicole Kidman , and Sophia Loren . The film received mixed reviews , with overall praise for the performances of Day-Lewis , Cotillard , and Cruz . He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and the Satellite Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy for his role , as well as sharing nominations for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture and the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Cast and the Satellite Award for Best Cast – Motion Picture with the rest of the cast members . 2010s Day-Lewis portrayed Abraham Lincoln in Steven Spielberg \\'s biopic Lincoln ( 2012 ) . Based on the book Team of Rivals : The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln , the film began shooting in Richmond , Virginia , in October 2011 . Day-Lewis spent a year in preparation for the role , a time he had requested from Spielberg . He read over 100 books on Lincoln , and long worked with the make-up artist to achieve a physical likeness to Lincoln . Speaking in Lincoln \\'s voice throughout the entire shoot , Day-Lewis asked the British crew members who shared his native accent not to chat with him . Spielberg said of Day-Lewis \\'s portrayal , \" I never once looked the gift horse in the mouth . I never asked Daniel about his process . I did n\\'t want to know . \" Lincoln received critical acclaim , especially for Day-Lewis \\'s performance . It also became a commercial success , grossing over $ 275 million worldwide . In November 2012 , he received the BAFTA Britannia Award for Excellence in Film . The same month , Day-Lewis featured on the cover of Time magazine as the \" World \\'s Greatest Actor \" . At the 70th Golden Globe Awards , on 14 January 2013 , Day-Lewis won his second Golden Globe Award for Best Actor , and at the 66th British Academy Film Awards on 10 February , he won his fourth BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role . At the 85th Academy Awards , Day-Lewis became the first three-time recipient of the Best Actor Oscar for his role in Lincoln . John Hartoch , Day-Lewis \\'s acting teacher at Bristol Old Vic theatre school , said of his former pupil \\'s achievement : Following his third Oscar win , there was much debate about Day-Lewis \\'s standing among the greatest actors in film history . Joe Queenan of The Guardian remarked , \" Arguing whether Daniel Day-Lewis is a greater actor than Laurence Olivier , or Richard Burton , or Marlon Brando , is like arguing whether Messi is more talented than Pelé , whether Napoleon Bonaparte edges out Alexander the Great as a military genius . \" When Day-Lewis himself was asked what it was like to be \" the world \\'s greatest actor \" , he replied , \" It \\'s daft is n\\'t it ? It changes all the time . \" Shortly after winning the Oscar for Lincoln , Day-Lewis announced he would be taking a break from acting , retreating back to his Georgian farmhouse in County Wicklow , Ireland , for the next five years , before making another film . After a five-year hiatus , Day-Lewis returned to the screen to star in Paul Thomas Anderson \\'s historical drama Phantom Thread ( 2017 ) . Set in 1950s London , Day-Lewis played an obsessive dressmaker , Reynolds Woodcock , who falls in love with a waitress ( played by Vicky Krieps ) . Prior to the film \\'s release , on 20 June 2017 , Day-Lewis \\'s spokeswoman , Leslee Dart , announced that he was retiring from acting . Unable to give an exact reason for his decision , in a November 2017 interview , Day-Lewis stated : \" I have n\\'t figured it out . But it \\'s settled on me , and it \\'s just there ... I dread to use the over-used word \\'artist \\' , but there \\'s something of the responsibility of the artist that hung over me . I need to believe in the value of what I \\'m doing . The work can seem vital , irresistible , even . And if an audience believes it , that should be good enough for me . But , lately , it is n\\'t . \" On Day-Lewis \\'s retirement , Anderson stated , \" I would like to hope that he just needs a break . But I do n\\'t know . It sure does n\\'t seem like it right now , which is a big drag for all of us . \" The film and his performance were met with widespread acclaim from critics , and Day-Lewis was again nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor . Widely respected among his peers , in June 2017 , Michael Simkins of The Guardian wrote , \" In this glittering cesspit we call the acting profession , there are plenty of rival thesps who , through sheer luck or happenstance , seem to have the career we ourselves could have had if only the cards had fallen differently . But Day-Lewis is , by common consent , even in the most sourly disposed green rooms – a class apart . We shall not look upon his like again – at least for a bit . Performers of his mercurial intensity come along once in a generation . \" In 2020 , The New York Times ranked him third on its list of the 25 Greatest Actors of the 21st century . Personal life Protective of his privacy , Day-Lewis has described his life as a \" lifelong study in evasion \" . He had a relationship with French actress Isabelle Adjani that lasted six years , eventually ending after a split and reconciliation . Their son , Gabriel-Kane Day-Lewis , was born on 9 April 1995 , in New York City , a few months after the relationship ended . In 1996 , while working on the film version of the stage play The Crucible , he visited the home of playwright Arthur Miller , where he was introduced to the writer \\'s daughter , Rebecca Miller . They married later that year , on 13 November 1996 . The couple have two sons , Ronan Cal Day-Lewis ( born 1998 ) and Cashel Blake Day-Lewis ( born 2002 ) . They divide their time between their homes in Annamoe , County Wicklow , and Manhattan , New York . Day-Lewis has held dual British and Irish citizenship since 1993 . He has maintained his Annamoe home since 1997 . He stated : \" I do have dual citizenship , but I think of England as my country . I miss London very much , but I could n\\'t live there because there came a time when I needed to be private and was forced to be public by the press . I could n\\'t deal with it . \" He is a supporter of South East London football club Millwall . Day-Lewis is also an Ambassador for The Lir Academy , a new drama school at Trinity College Dublin , founded in 2011 . On 15 July 2010 , Day-Lewis received an honorary doctorate in letters from the University of Bristol , in part because of his attendance of the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in his youth . Day-Lewis has stated that he had \" no real religious education \" , and that he \" suppose [ s ] \" he is \" a die-hard agnostic \" . In October 2012 , he donated to the University of Oxford papers belonging to his father , the poet Cecil Day-Lewis , including early drafts of the poet \\'s work and letters from actor John Gielgud and literary figures such as W . H . Auden , Robert Graves , and Philip Larkin . In July 2015 , he became the Honorary President of the Poetry Archive . A registered UK charity , the Poetry Archive is a free website containing a growing collection of recordings of English-language poets reading their work . In June 2017 , Day-Lewis became a patron of the Wilfred Owen Association . Day-Lewis \\'s association with Wilfred Owen began with his father , Cecil Day-Lewis , who edited Owen \\'s poetry in the 1960s and his mother , Jill Balcon , who was a vice-president of the Wilfred Owen Association until her death in 2009 . In 2008 , when he received the Academy Award for Best Actor from Helen Mirren ( who was on presenting duty having won the previous year \\'s Best Actress Oscar for portraying Queen Elizabeth II in The Queen ) , Day-Lewis knelt before her , and she tapped him on each shoulder with the Oscar statuette , to which he quipped , \" That \\'s the closest I \\'ll come to ever getting a knighthood . \" Day-Lewis was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to drama . On 14 November 2014 , he was knighted by Prince William , Duke of Cambridge , in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace .

In his playing career he was nicknamed Der Kaiser ( \" The Emperor \" ) because of his elegant style , dominance and leadership on the field , and also as his first name \" Franz \" is reminiscent of the Austrian emperors . He is widely regarded to be one of the greatest players in the history of the sport . A versatile player who started out as a midfielder , Beckenbauer made his name as a central defender . He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper ( libero ) . Twice named European Footballer of the Year , Beckenbauer appeared 103 times for West Germany and played in three FIFA World Cups and two European Championships . He is one of three men , along with Brazil \\'s Mário Zagallo and France \\'s Didier Deschamps , to have won the World Cup as a player and as a manager ; he lifted the World Cup trophy as captain in 1974 , and repeated the feat as a manager in 1990 . He was the first captain to lift the World Cup and European Championship at international level and the European Cup at club level . He was named in the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998 , the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002 , the Ballon d\\'Or Dream Team in 2020 , and in 2004 was listed in the FIFA 100 of the world \\'s greatest living players . At club level with Bayern Munich , Beckenbauer won the UEFA Cup Winners \\' Cup in 1967 and three consecutive European Cups from 1974 to 1976 . The latter feat made him the first player to win three European Cups as captain of his club . He became team manager and later president of Bayern Munich . After two spells with the New York Cosmos he was inducted into the U.S . National Soccer Hall of Fame . Beckenbauer led Germany \\'s successful bid to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup and chaired the organizing committee . He worked as a pundit for Sky Germany , and for 34 years as a columnist for the tabloid Bild , both until 2016 . In August 2016 , it was announced Beckenbauer was being investigated for fraud and money laundering as part of the 2006 World Cup . The investigation was closed without a verdict in 2020 as the statute of limitations expired . Early years Franz Beckenbauer was born in the post-war ruins of Munich , the second son of postal-worker Franz Beckenbauer , Sr . and his wife Antonie ( née Hupfauf ) . He grew up in the working-class district of Giesing and , despite his father \\'s cynicism about the game , started playing football at the age of nine with the youth team of SC Munich \\'06 in 1954 . Originally a centre forward , he idolised 1954 FIFA World Cup winner Fritz Walter and supported local side 1860 Munich , then the pre-eminent team in the city , despite their relegation from the top league , the Oberliga Süd , in the 1950s . \" It was always my dream to play for them \" he would later confirm . That he joined the Bayern Munich youth team in 1959 , rather than that of his favourites 1860 Munich , was the result of a contentious Under-14 youth tournament in nearby Neubiberg . Beckenbauer and his teammates were aware that their SC Munich \\'06 club lacked the finance to continue running its youth sides , and had determined to join 1860 Munich as a group upon the tournament \\'s conclusion . However , fortune decreed that SC Munich and 1860 would meet in the final and a series of niggles during the match eventually resulted in a physical confrontation between Beckenbauer and the opposing centre-half . The ill-feeling this engendered had a strong effect upon Beckenbauer and his teammates , who decided to join Bayern \\'s youth side rather than the team they had recently come to blows with . In 1963 , at the age of 18 , Beckenbauer was engulfed by controversy when it was revealed that his then girlfriend was pregnant and that he had no intention of marrying her ; he was banned from the West German national youth team by the DFB and only readmitted after the intervention of the side \\'s coach Dettmar Cramer . Club career Beckenbauer made his debut with Bayern in a Bundesliga promotion play-off match on the left wing against FC St . Pauli on 6 June 1964 . In his first season in the Regionalliga Süd ( \" Regional League South \" , then the second level in Germany ) , 1964–65 , the team won the league and eventually promoted to the Bundesliga . Bayern soon became a force in the new German league , winning the German Cup in 1966–67 and achieving European success in the Cup Winners \\' Cup in 1967 . Beckenbauer became team captain for the 1968–69 season and led his club to their first league title . He began experimenting with the sweeper ( libero ) role around this time , refining the role into a new form and becoming perhaps the greatest exponent of the attacking sweeper game . During Beckenbauer \\'s tenure at Bayern Munich , the club won three league championships in a row from 1972 to 1974 and also a hat-trick of European Cup wins ( 1974–76 ) which earned the club the honour of keeping the trophy permanently . Since 1968 Beckenbauer , has been called Der Kaiser by fans and the media . The following anecdote is told ( even by Beckenbauer himself ) to explain the origin : On the occasion of a friendly game of Bayern Munich in Vienna , Austria , Beckenbauer posed for a photo session right beside a bust of the former Austrian emperor Franz Joseph I . The media called him Fußball-Kaiser ( football-emperor ) afterwards , soon after he was just called Der Kaiser . However , according to a report in the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag , this explanation is untrue , though very popular . According to the report , Beckenbauer fouled his opposite number , Reinhard Libuda from Schalke 04 , in the cup final on 14 June 1969 . Disregarding the fans \\' hooting , Beckenbauer took the ball into the opposite part of the field , where he balanced the ball in front of the upset fans for half a minute . Libuda was commonly called König von Westfalen ( king of Westphalia ) , so the press looked for an even more exalted moniker and invented Der Kaiser . In 1977 , Beckenbauer accepted a lucrative contract to play in the North American Soccer League with the New York Cosmos . He played with the Cosmos for four seasons up to 1980 , and the team won the Soccer Bowl on three occasions ( 1977 , 1978 , 1980 ) . Beckenbauer retired after a two-year spell with Hamburger SV in Germany ( 1980–82 ) with the win of the Bundesliga title that year and one final season with the New York Cosmos in 1983 . In his career , he appeared in 754 competitive club matches . International career Beckenbauer won 103 caps and scored 14 goals for West Germany . He was a member of the World Cup squads that finished runners-up in 1966 , third place in 1970 , and champions in 1974 , while also being named to the tournament all-star team in all three editions . He also won the 1972 European Football Championship and finished as runners-up in the 1976 edition . Beckenbauer \\'s first game for the national team came on 26 September 1965 . 1966 World Cup Beckenbauer appeared in his first World Cup in 1966 , playing every match . In his first World Cup match , against Switzerland , he scored twice in a 5–0 win . West Germany won their group , and then beat Uruguay 4–0 in quarter-finals , with Beckenbauer scoring the second goal in the 70th minute . In the semi-finals , the Germans faced the USSR . Helmut Haller opened the scoring , with Beckenbauer contributing the second of the match , his fourth goal of the tournament . The Soviets scored a late goal but were unable to draw level , and West Germany advanced to the final against hosts England . The English won the final and the Jules Rimet Trophy in extra time . The Germans had fallen at the final hurdle , but Beckenbauer had a notable tournament , finishing tied for third on the list of top scorers—from a non-attacking position . The team returned to a heroes \\' welcome in their homeland . 1970 World Cup West Germany won their first three matches before facing England in the second round in a rematch of the 1966 final . The English were ahead 2–0 in the second half , but a spectacular goal by Beckenbauer in the 69th minute helped the Germans recover and equalise before the end of normal time and win the match in extra time . West Germany advanced to the semi-finals to face Italy , in what would be known as the Game of the Century . He dislocated his shoulder after being fouled , but he was not deterred from continuing in the match , as his side had already used their two permitted substitutions . He stayed on the field carrying his dislocated arm in a sling . The result of this match was 4–3 ( after extra time ) in favour of the Italians . Germany defeated Uruguay 1–0 for third place . 1972 European championship Beckenbauer became captain of the national side in 1971 . In 1972 , West Germany won the European Championship , beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final . 1974 World Cup The 1974 World Cup was hosted by West Germany and Beckenbauer led his side to victory , including a hard-fought 2–1 win over the hotly favoured Netherlands side featuring Johan Cruyff . Beckenbauer and fellow defenders man-marked Cruyff so well that the Dutch were never quite able to put their \" Total Football \" into full use . Beckenbauer became the first captain to lift the new FIFA World Cup Trophy after Brazil had retained the Jules Rimet Trophy in 1970 . This also gave West Germany the distinction of being the first European national team to hold both the European Championship and World Cup titles simultaneously ( two other countries have done it since : France in 2000 , and Spain in 2010 ) . 1976 European Championship In the 1976 competition , West Germany again reached the final , where they lost on penalties to Czechoslovakia . Beckenbauer was named in the Team of the Tournament . Beckenbauer retired from international football in 1977 , at the age of 31 , following his move to New York Cosmos . Managerial career On his return to Germany , Beckenbauer was appointed manager of the West German national team to replace Jupp Derwall on 12 September 1984 . He took the team all the way to the final of the 1986 World Cup , where they lost to the Diego Maradona inspired Argentina . In 1990 , before the German reunification , Beckenbauer managed the last German team without East German players in a World Cup , winning the final 1–0 , against Argentina , in a rematch of the previous World Cup final . Beckenbauer is one of three men ( with Mario Zagallo , and Didier Deschamps ) to have won the Cup as player and as manager , and he is the first man and one of only two ( with Didier Deschamps ) to have won the title as team captain as well as manager . Beckenbauer then moved into club management , and accepted a job with Olympique de Marseille in 1990 but left the club within one year . Marseille eventually won the 1990–91 French championship and ended runner-up of the 1990–91 European Cup . From 28 December 1993 until 30 June 1994 , and then from 29 April 1996 until 30 June of the same year , he managed Bayern Munich . His brief spells in charge saw him collect two further honours – the Bundesliga title in 1994 and the UEFA Cup in 1996 . In 1994 , he took on the role of club president at Bayern , and much of the success in the following years has been credited to his astute management . Following the club \\'s decision to change from an association to a limited company , he has been chairman of the advisory board since the beginning of 2002 . He stepped down as president of Bayern in 2009 , being succeeded by long-time general manager Uli Hoeneß . In 1998 , he became vice-president of the German Football Association . At the end of the 1990s , Beckenbauer headed the successful bid by Germany to organize the 2006 FIFA World Cup . He chaired the organizational committee for the World Cup and was a commentator for the Bild-Zeitung . FIFA inquiries and ban In June 2014 , Beckenbauer was banned by FIFA Ethics Committee for 90 days from any football-related activity for allegedly refusing to cooperate with an inquiry into corruption dealing with the allocation of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar . He protested the ban , as he had requested the questions that were put to him be in German and in writing . The ban was lifted after Beckenbauer agreed to participate in FIFA \\'s inquiry . In February 2016 , Beckenbauer was fined CHF 7,000 and warned by FIFA Ethics Committee for failing to cooperate with the inquiry in 2014 . In March 2016 , the Ethics Committee opened formal proceedings against Beckenbauer regarding the awarding of the 2006 FIFA World Cup . In October 2019 , Black Mirror Leaks published email correspondence of Russian member of Parliament , Sergey Kapkov , where Beckenbauer and his adviser , Fedor Radmann , were named as recipients of €3 million for their votes in favour of Russia as host of the 2018 World Cup . Both allegedly received an additional €1.5 million in success fees after the 2018 cup was allocated to Russia . In 2021 , FIFA closed its ethics inquiry against Beckenbauer as the statute of limitations expired . Legacy Beckenbauer is widely considered to be one of the greatest footballers in the history of the game . He is the only defender in football history to win the Ballon d\\'Or twice . He is often credited as having invented the role of the modern sweeper or libero , a defensive player who intervenes proactively in the offensive game of his team . Named European Footballer of the Year twice , Beckenbauer was chosen on the World Team of the 20th Century in 1998 , and the FIFA World Cup Dream Team in 2002 . An icon in Germany , and one of only three men to have won the World Cup both as a player and as a manager , Beckenbauer was lauded by former German chancellor Gerhard Schröder for winning the World Cup as a player in 1974 , winning as manager in 1990 , and for playing a leading role in Germany \\'s success of achieving host status of the 2006 World Cup . Media During his playing career , Beckenbauer \\'s popularity was such that he was included as a character in Monty Python \\'s sketch \" The Philosophers \\' Football Match \" as the sole genuine player and a \" surprise inclusion \" to the German team . During the match , between famous Greek and German philosophers , instead of actually playing football , the \" players \" walk in circles contemplating philosophy , while \" asking questions \" , a popular phrase used by English football commentators , much to the confusion of Beckenbauer . In a 2013 advertisement for South Korean company Samsung , Beckenbauer appeared as the manager of a Galaxy XI of football players from around the globe , and hands the captain \\'s armband to Lionel Messi . Beckenbauer features in EA Sports \\' FIFA video game series ; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends . Personal life Beckenbauer has been married three times and has five children , one of whom , Stephan , was a professional footballer , who died after a long illness on 31 July 2015 , at the age of 46 . After appearing in an advertisement for a big mobile phone company , Beckenbauer specifically requested the number 0176 / 666666 for his mobile phone . However , he soon was flooded with phone calls by men who thought it was a phone sex number ( in German , \" 6 \" translates to \" sechs \" , sounding similar to the word sex ) .

Often , roots revivals include an addition of newly composed songs with socially and politically aware lyrics , as well as a general modernization of the folk sound . The term roots revival is vague , and may not always refer to identical events . Characteristics associated with a roots revival include : Popularization of previously non-mainstream folk music Adaptation of folk styles to pop ( or rock ) structures Invention of new formats like bands where only solo acts had existed before Introduction of new instruments Composition of works by those who perform them , as opposed to folk tunes mostly passed down orally ( see singer-songwriter ) Incorporation of politically aware lyrics , often critical of a government , religion , or other authority , or society in general Lyrics are the first from the nation to express more than simple desires and problems , and are often seen as the embodiment of a national character or literary tradition ( in comparison to the legendary American songwriter , such composers are often said to be the \" Bob Dylan \" of a particular variety , as in Wannes Van de Velde is the Belgian Bob Dylan ) Roots revival performers will often come from very different social and economic backgrounds compared to the people whose style of music they are popularizing . With such a vague and variable definition , roots revival could be seen as referring to the creation of any kind of pop music industry , though there are countries with well-developed pop traditions that have not had a period referred to as a roots revival ( such as Jamaica , India , Cuba , and Kenya ) . For example , homogenized pop has long had its fans in most every country in the world , but many of these nations have created their own indigenous pop styles out of folk music ; this process could be called a roots revival , though in some cases the folk musics in question were still widespread and did not need to be revived . History The British folk revival was an academic movement to transcribe and record traditional British songs during the late 19th and early 20th century . Pioneers of this movement were the Harvard professor Francis James Child ( 1825–96 ) , compiler of The English and Scottish Popular Ballads ( 1882–92 ) , Sabine Baring-Gould ( 1834–1924 ) , Frank Kidson ( 1855–1926 ) , Lucy Broadwood ( 1858–1939 ) , and Anne Gilchrist ( 1863–1954 ) . The Folk Song Society was founded in 1898 to promote this new endeavour . A major figure in this movement was Cecil Sharp who was the most influential on the repertoire of subsequent performers and defining the nature of folk song . His lectures and other publications attempted to define a musical tradition that was rural in origin , oral in transmission and communal in nature . The American folk music revival , which focused on culture and entertainment , began in the 1930s and 1940s . During the Great Depression , folk music styles were disseminated around the country , as Delta blues , Latino and Cajun musicians , and itinerant honky tonk singers spread to cities like Chicago , Los Angeles , and New York City . The growth of the music industry in the same period was also important ; higher potential profits from music placed pressure on artists , songwriters , and label executives to replicate previous hit songs . This meant that musical fads , such as Hawaiian slack-key guitar , never died out completely , since a broad range of rhythms , instruments , and vocal stylings were incorporated into disparate popular genres . The movement became global in the 1960s and 1970s . In most cases , the folk music being revived was not quite extinct , though some had n\\'t been played for years or was moribund ; such cases include the Celtic music of Cornwall and the Isle of Man , for example . In other cases , such as Cameroon and the Dominican Republic , no revival was necessary as the music remained common , and was merely popularized and adapted for mainstream audiences at home and abroad . Roots revivals Algerian music : Beginning as early as 1964 , gaining steam in the 1970s and continuing through the 1980s , a mainstream raï revival occurred , and pop-raï stars like Khaled and Chaba Fadela gained worldwide audiences ; the same period saw similar trends occur among Kabyle musicians such as Idir , Ferhat and Lounis Ait Menguellet , who popularized the native sounds of their people Belgian music : Starting early in the 1960s , a wave of popular folk-based performers emerged , led by Wannes Van de Velde , who drew primarily on Flemish traditions . By the 1980s , popular bands included Brabants Volksorkest and the folk rock band Kadril . Beninese music : Artists like Tohon Stan have created a popular version of Benin \\'s numerous styles of indigenous folk music , such as tchink-system , a derivative of the funeral genre of tchinkoumé Cambodian music : The early 1960s saw a revival of classical music and dance , inspired by Princess Norodom Buppha Devi and led by Sinn Sisamouth , though the rise of the Khmer Rouge largely ended this trend . Cameroonian music : Beginning with bikutsi in the 1950s and continuing with makossa into the end of the 20th century , Cameroon \\'s popularized folk musics have become among the most prominent in Africa . Messi Me Nkonda Martin undoubtedly did the most to evolve bikutsi from its folk origins into a popular style using electric guitars and other importations , while Manu Dibango brought makossa to new audiences around the world . Chinese music : Partially as a reaction against attempts by the Communist government to use traditional styles to drum up patriotism and loyalty , the 1970s saw the creation of Chinese rock and Cantopop ( in Hong Kong ) , both of which made some use of native folk styles , especially in vocal techniques . The leader of Chinese rock is undoubtedly Cui Jian . Ivorian music : Ernesto Djédjé \\'s ziglibithy style incorporates a number of folk genres from across Côte d\\'Ivoire , a diverse country with hundred of ethnic groups ; Djédjé \\'s most immediate influence was the folk rhythms of the Bété . Croatian music : By the 1980s , Croatian pop-folk had seen some mainstream success , and a wave of bands appeared , inspired by Vještice , who combined Međimurje folk music with rock in an innovative fusion of sounds . Czech music : In 1966 , the Porta Festival was held , and a wave of singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Pete Seeger arose . Danish music : In contrast to its neighbors , Denmark did not see a Roots revival until the late 1990s , when performers like Morten Alfred Høirup gained a widespread following in the country . Dutch music : The late 1960s saw a revival of Dutch folk music , led by performers like Gerard van Maasakkers ; popularity was limited , and soon ended , though region of Friesland has maintained a strong traditional music scene . Egyptian music : The city of Cairo is the most important center for Egyptian music , which includes a variety of popularized folk styles , including northern sawahii and southern saiyidi . Finnish music : Finland \\'s folk styles include a variety of national genres and ballads , while the traditional rhyming sleigh songs rekilaulu have become an integral part of many pop singers . In 1967 , the Savonlinna Opera Festival , the first of several similar festivals , contributed to a revival of Finnish opera and other more traditional styles . French music : Though many of France \\'s regional styles have seen popularization , the most vibrant scene is undoubtedly the traditional music of Brittany . The region boasts a uniquely Celtic heritage , which has been emphasized by the revival since its beginnings in the early 1970s , led by Alan Stivell . Corsican music has also seen a revival , though with little popular success , concurrent with the rise of Corsican nationalism in the 1970s . In the same way Occitan music , has also seen a revival with Occitan nationalism and reviviscence of occitan speaking in 60 \\'s ( politic crisis with Gaullists to a clash with French linguistic imperialism and conservative politics ) See also the Québécois under Canadian music . Gambian music : By the 1970s , Gambian musicians were mostly playing popular merengue or other styles . A visit by pop band The Super Eagles to London to record saw a change , as they were encouraged to continue their practice of Gambian folk . The band became known as Ifang Bondi , and their music was called Afro-Manding blues . Garifuna music : Starting in the 1970s and continuing into the following decades , the Garifunas , an Afro-Caribbean people found throughout Central America , began turning to their native punta sound and creating popular styles like punta rock , which found an audience across the area . Pen Cayetano was the most important figure in this scene . German music : Following the 1968 student revolution in West Germany , singer-songwriters playing a kind of expressive , melancholy music with traditional influences became popular . Due to governmental interference , East Germany did not see much of this influence until the mid-1970s . Ghanaian music : Ghana is best known for the highlife style of music , which has been popular throughout the 20th century . By the late 1960s , however , the pop scene was dominated by generic guitar bands that imitated Western acts . The 1971 Soul to Soul festival , however , featured a number of African American musicians ( like Wilson Pickett and Tina Turner ) , which had the effect of legitimizing African culture , thus causing a major roots revival that brought highlife to international audiences . Greek music : The late 1960s and early 1970s coup repressed rembétika , a style which had developed earlier in the century . This oppression ironically created a major boom in popularity for the genre , which became associated with political resistance and rebellion . Singer-songwriters like Dionysis Savvopoulos also became wildly popular , and were seen as voices of the Greek nation . Music of Israel : Early Zionist settlers in Palestine , as far back as the 1880s , sought to create a new mode of Jewish folk music that was based on Biblical musical modes that had long since been abandoned . These composers , who included Matityahu Shelem , Yedidiah Admon , and many others , drew on Yemenite , Arabic and other antique sources to create a unique style that they considered a revival of ancient Jewish music . The songs that they and their followers composed constitute a canonical body of folk music called \" Songs of the Land of Israel . \" These songs are still widely performed today by popular artists . Another example of roots revival in Israel is the preservation of regional Jewish musical styles . The music of North African and Middle Eastern Jewish communities has morphed into an eclectic new style called \" Muzika Mizrahit \" . Folksongs in Yiddish and Ladino have been revived and recorded by artists like Chava Alberstein and Yehoram Gaon . Yair Dalal incorporates stylistic elements of the music of his native Iraq in his synthetic musical style . Italian music : The diverse regions of Italy are home to dozens of varieties of folk music . By the 1950s , their popularity was declining rapidly and a group of musicians and musicologists founded organizations like Istituto de Martino and Nuovo Canzoniere Italiano to help preserve folk cultures . The following decade saw a revival of a number of traditions , including Ciccio Busacca \\'s fusions of Sicilian folk styles , central Italy \\'s jazzy modern folk , pioneered by Canzoniere del Lazio , the re-appearance of the lira through the work of Re Niliu , the popularization of diverse genres of northern Italian music and some of the work of world-famous tenor Enrico Caruso , who revitalized Naples \\' canzone napoletana tradition . In contrast to many other countries \\' , Italy \\'s roots revival has resulted in very little mainstream success . Japanese music : Though elements of traditional Japanese music can be found in some rock and pop from the country , the only major roots revival was Okinawan , and began in the late 1980s . Popularized Okinawan folk music includes genres like kawachi ondo and goshu ondo . Korean music : In the early 1970s , a genre called t\\'ong guitar developed , performed by singer-songwriters inspired by the likes of American Bob Dylan and Joan Baez . Korean folk has seen little popular success , though there has been some for the pansori , nongak and sanjo styles . Latvian music : Its traditional long suppressed or appropriated by the Soviet Union , Latvia \\'s kokles ( an instrument similar to a box zither ) was revived and popularised in the 1970s , led by traditional suiti kokle player Jānis Poriķis and ethnomusicologist Valdis Muktupāvels . Lithuanian music : The Soviet Union had sponsored some music festivals , such as the dainų šventės , but did not allow for much lyrical or musical innovation , and kept all songwriters from experimenting with politically aware and dissident lyrics . An active cultural rebellion occurred in the 1960s , based around a series of national music festivals and concerts . Malian music : Cuban music had become extremely popular in Mali by the 1960s , and little folk music could compete . The country \\'s second president , however , Moussa Traoré , encouraged the growth of a Malian music industry , resulting in a revival of some kinds of folk music , and a popularization led by Salif Keita . Later Fanto Sacko \\'s bajourou music and wassoulou music also became popularized . However , by the 1980s , Malian pop had lost most traces of its folk origins and was simply dance music , even topping the European charts ; another roots revival occurred , led by Guinean acoustic singer and kora player Jali Musa Jawara . Mozambiquan music : Music was used in the 1960s by the independence movement in Mozambique . Leaders in this movement encouraged the growth of a national music industry . By the 1970s , native forms of music , such as marrabenta , had been popularized . Russian music : Starting in about 1966 , a group of bards arose , most prominently including Vladimir Vysotsky , and Vyacheslav Shchurov organized a number of concerts for folk singers . This led to a revival and revitalization of Russian folk songs , a trend which continued in ensuing decades . Sami music : The Sami , an indigenous people found in central and northern Scandinavia , northern Finland and northwestern Russia , have a tradition of folk songs called joiks , which have been popularized by the likes of Mari Boine , who remains a legend in the field . Slovenian music : in the 1950s , the so-called \" folk popular music \" emerged with groups like Avsenik and Lojze Slak band , based on modernized Slovenian-style polka . In the 1980s , a completely different trend emerged , based on more archaic folk music , usually from specific regions ; and it was popularized by groups like Istranova ( Slovenian Istria ) and singer Vlado Kreslin ( Prekmurje ) . Latin America , Portugal and Spain Argentine music : In the 1960s , Andean nationalism was spreading across Argentina , Chile , Bolivia and Peru . Argentina \\'s nativist scene includes landmark performers like Mercedes Sosa and Atahualpa Yupanqui , who helped spawn the nueva canción scene . Bolivian music : The 1950s saw an increase in nationalist identity surrounding the Quechua and Aymara peoples , and a number of intellectuals began associating themselves with folk music , clothing , cuisine and other elements . By the mid-1960s , a folk revival was blossoming , led by Edgar Jofré . Brazilian music : Beginning in the 1950s and continuing for several decades , a multitude of Brazilian styles ( most importantly samba ) and imported American jazz combined to create the wildly popular bossa nova scene . This soon evolved into the politically charged Tropicalia genre , which starred controversial and acclaimed singer-songwriters Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil . Chilean music : In the early to mid-1960s , the burgeoning nueva canción movement spread throughout Chile , Argentina , Bolivia and Peru , featuring a wave of singer-songwriters who incorporated folk elements and nationalist lyrics , often critical of governmental authorities , and achieved great acclaim . Violeta Parra is sometimes viewed as the founder of the scene , for she popularized Quechua and Aymara songs and provided an outlet for performances by future luminaries like Victor Jara . Cuban music : By the 1960s , Cuban music had seen international success in the form of pop-mambo , chachacha and other genres , and many artists were disillusioned with these styles , which were seen as watered-down . A vanguard of singer-songwriters like Silvio Rodríguez and Pablo Milanés arose , composing politically aware songs in a style that came to be called Nueva Trova . Dominican music : Merengue had been popular in the Dominican Republic for decades since evolving out of confusing folk origins , but did not truly become a form of pop music until the early 1960s , when legends like Johnny Ventura brought the music to new audiences at home and abroad . Spanish music was incorporated into Spanish Baroque music in the harpsichord works of Soler . Later composers such as Albeniz , Falla , Rodrigo and Giuliani used the dance rhythms of Spain . The classical guitarists Andrés Segovia , John Williams and Julian Bream popularised the music through their recordings . Current popular folk musicians include Susana Seivane , Hevia and Milladoiro . A roots revival Nueva canción , which also evolved into new form of socially committed music occurred in several Spanish-speaking countries . Portuguese music : In the 1960s and 1970s , José Afonso led a return to more traditionally styled fado music , which later evolved into a number of new song forms that incorporated socio-political lyrics and foreign influences . English-speaking countries Includes English and Celtic revivals For additional Celtic music , see the French section above Australian music : Beginning in the 1980s , Australian Aborigines began turning to their native styles of folk music , which were updated , creating popular bands and styles like Aboriginal rock . Canadian music : Though some artists , like The Band , Neil Young and Joni Mitchell , had been integral parts of the 1960s American folk rock scene , Canada has seen its own distinctive revival of styles . This includes the late 1970s scene in Maritime Canada , which glorified the area \\'s Celtic heritage and was led by regional legends Figgy Duff and Stan Rogers , as well as the mid-1960s Quebecois revival led by Gilles Vigneault . There were also revivals of Acadian , Inuit and other folk styles . In the 1950s and 1960s dedicated folk music collectors spread out across the country to record traditional music . The songs and tunes were popularized on public radio by performers such as Alan Mills , Stu Davis , Marg Osborne , and the Travellers . A number of musicians who grew up listening to this traditional music became singer-songwriters in the 1970s ; for example , Gordon Lightfoot and Ian and Sylvia . English music : There were two folk music revivals in England . The first , led by Cecil Sharp , was academic . It involved the collection of songs and tunes and their publication in journals . It was at its peak about 1910 . The second revival involved large-scale public performances of English music , beginning with the appearance of the Copper Family at the Royal Albert Hall in 1952 , together with a proliferation of folk clubs meeting mainly in the upper rooms of public houses . Starting in the late 1960s the songs were performed in a contemporary style ; this was the origin of the British folk rock style . Irish music : There was a revival of Irish folk music that began in the early 20th century , based both in Dublin and Ireland , though the longer-lasting and more famous revival began in 1955 with the album \" The Lark in the Morning \" , whose recording was supervised by Diane Hamilton and which featured Liam Clancy and Tommy Makem prior to their involvement with the influential but U.S.-based Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem . Later famous groups include The Dubliners ( founded 1962 ) , The Chieftains ( 1963 ) , Ceoltóirí Chualann , and Clannad ( 1973 ) . Later , singer-songwriters such as Christy Moore were inspired by American popular folk singers , and they took to modernizing and adapting Irish music for modern audiences . The result was a dramatic change from folk traditions , including the introduction of the bouzouki and influences including soul and rock . Scottish music : The Scottish folk revival begin in 1951 when Hamish Henderson created the People \\'s Festival . The Boys of the Lough were one of the first instrumental Celtic groups to tour the world . US music : The American Folklore Society was founded in 1888 . Some members , including Frank Clyde Brown , George Lyman Kittredge , and John Lomax began collecting and recording \\'trivial \\' music of minority groups . During the late 1920s and early 1930s , performers such as A . P . Carter , Bascom Lamar Lunsford , Lesley Riddle , and Woody Guthrie specifically began to seek out traditional songs to incorporate them into their performance repertoire . A traditional music revival started the American folk music revival that began in the 1940s and led to a new genre , contemporary folk music . A group of American archivists and researchers that included John A . Lomax , his son Alan Lomax , poet Carl Sandburg , musician Charles Seeger , and others collected , recorded , and published old ballads , prison songs , Appalachian folk music and black blues . A number of performers influenced by traditional music , such as Pete Seeger , Josh White , Burl Ives , and The Weavers , enjoyed considerable commercial success in the 1940s , leading to a broader commercial revival in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with performers such as The Kingston Trio , Joan Baez , and Peter , Paul and Mary selling millions of record albums . The folk revival in the US led to the creation of folk rock , a new genre that drew on songs and themes associated with folk music and arranged them with rock ‘ n ’ roll instruments . Many of the early artists and groups associated with the genre began as folk musicians , most notably Bob Dylan , Simon & Garfunkel , Roger McGuinn of the Byrds , and Jerry Garcia of The Grateful Dead . The 21st century saw a smaller revival of Appalachian folk music with the release of the 2000 motion picture soundtrack to \" O Brother , Where Art Thou ? \" . Singers such as Gillian Welch and Alison Krauss and the bluegrass performer Ralph Stanley were featured on the album . Transnational : During the 2010s , folk-inspired acts began to score chart hits in the UK , US and beyond . Most notably the UK group Mumford & Sons won the Grammy ( US National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences award ) for best album in 2013 . References Further reading General Bakan , Michael B .

Folk music genres', 'Hernán Jorge Crespo ( ; born 5 July 1975 ) is an Argentine professional football coach and former player . A prolific striker , Crespo scored over 300 goals in a career spanning 19 years . At international level , he scored 35 goals and is Argentina \\'s fourth highest goalscorer behind only Sergio Agüero , Gabriel Batistuta and Lionel Messi . He played in three FIFA World Cups : 1998 , 2002 , 2006 . At club level , Crespo was the world \\'s most expensive player , when he was bought by Lazio from Parma in 2000 for €56 million ( £35.5 million ) . He was top scorer in the 2000–01 Serie A with 26 goals , playing for Lazio . Crespo \\'s awards include three Serie A scudetti , a Copa Libertadores , a Premier League title and an Olympic Games silver medal . In 2004 , he was named by Pelé in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players . Crespo never received a red card during his career . Club career River Plate Crespo made his debut with River Plate during the 1993–94 season , scoring 13 goals in 25 league appearances as River Plate won the Apertura league title . In 1996 , he helped River win the Copa Libertadores , scoring twice in the home leg of the final in Buenos Aires . Parma Crespo left River Plate for Parma on 14 August 1996 after he won the silver medal with Argentina at the 1996 Summer Olympics and finished as the top scorer with six goals . He failed to score in his first six months at the club and was routinely booed , with head coach Carlo Ancelotti coming in for much criticism for keeping faith with the selection of Crespo . His faith , however , vindicated – Crespo went on to score 12 times in 27 matches in his first Serie A season and Parma finished runners-up to Juventus . The turning point was the standing applause he received for his brace against Cagliari in March 1997 . Parma won the 1998–99 Coppa Italia and he scored the opening goal in Parma \\'s 3–0 UEFA Cup final victory over Marseille . He had scored 80 goals in four seasons . Lazio In 2000 , Lazio broke the then-world transfer record by paying £35 million ( they paid £16 million in cash and transferred Matías Almeyda and Sérgio Conceição ) to acquire Crespo , who in turn finished as Serie A \\'s top scorer with 26 goals . Lazio , however , failed to defend its league title in 2001 , and the following season , Crespo suffered from some injuries , while new signings Jaap Stam and Gaizka Mendieta failed to live up their reputations , following the departures of playmakers Juan Sebastián Verón and Pavel Nedvěd . Crespo was left without the attacking support he had enjoyed in 2001 , but still scored a respectable haul of goals . Lazio \\'s financial problems , however , forced the club to sell several players , and following Alessandro Nesta \\'s transfer to A.C . Milan , speculation over Crespo \\'s future intensified . Inter Milan On 31 August 2002 , Crespo , expected to shine again after suffering from injuries , signed with Inter Milan as a replacement for the ex-player Ronaldo for a €26 million fee and Bernardo Corradi . Lazio later re-valued Corradi to €5.5 million . Inter was short of strikers after the highly rated Mohamed Kallon was injured in August , and only Álvaro Recoba and Christian Vieri , together with reserves Bernardo Corradi and Nicola Ventola , were available . Crespo scored seven goals in three appearances , along with nine goals in 12 Champions League matches , until he was sidelined for four months by injury in early 2003 . Chelsea Crespo was transferred to Premier League club Chelsea on 26 August 2003 for a fee of reported £16.8 million which also created a controversy in alleged false accounting . Following the transfer , Christian Vieri , Crespo \\'s former strike partner at Inter , claimed that the club are essentially \" weakening \" by selling players of such caliber . He made his league debut on 30 August 2003 as a substitute for Adrian Mutu in a 2–2 home draw against Blackburn Rovers . On 16 September 2003 , Crespo made his European debut , replacing Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in the 2003–04 Champions League group stage , which ended in a 1–0 away win after a late goal from William Gallas against Sparta Prague . Four days later , he scored his first goals , a double , in a 5–0 away victory against Wolverhampton Wanderers . Crespo made 31 appearances ( including 19 in the league ) in all competitions , scoring 12 goals . A.C . Milan ( loan ) After José Mourinho took over as Chelsea manager for the 2004–05 season , Crespo became surplus to Chelsea \\'s plans following the arrival of Didier Drogba and was loaned to A.C . Milan , as requested by then-manager Carlo Ancelotti . He scored a total of ten league goals , and scored twice in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final in a defeat to Liverpool . In scoring a Champions League goal with Milan , Crespo became the first player to score with five teams in the competition , doing so with each of the sides he had played for since moving from South America to Europe in 1996 . Return to Chelsea After Chelsea \\'s failed attempts to land a big-name striker during the summer of 2005 , Mourinho needed competition for striker Didier Drogba and decided to recall Crespo from A.C . Milan , convincing him that he had a future in England . Crespo made his first return appearance in a 2–1 FA Community Shield win over Arsenal . He scored his first league goal of 2005 against newly promoted Wigan Athletic in the 93rd minute of Chelsea \\'s season opener in a 1–0 win , with a left foot curler into the top corner from 25 yards . The 2005–06 league title was Crespo \\'s first league title victory in European football . Return to Inter Milan Second spell ; loan from 2006 to 2008 Though he scored 13 goals in all competitions and won the 2005–06 Premier League , Crespo requested a return to Italy in order to rejoin A.C . Milan , but Chelsea refused and announced that Crespo would remain a Chelsea player until the club accepted a suitable offer for him . On 7 August 2006 , Crespo joined Inter on a two-year loan . He scored his 125th Serie A goal against Siena on 2 December 2006 , and his 200th career goal in Europe on 2 April 2007 . On 13 May , Crespo scored a hat-trick to help Inter defeat Lazio 4–3 and win the Scudetto . Third spell ; permanent deal Crespo was released from Chelsea on 3 July 2008 , following the expiration of his contract , and was signed by Inter on a one-year contract for free . In the 2008–09 season , under José Mourinho , his former manager in Chelsea , Crespo only made 13 Serie A appearances , including two starts . He was excluded from the Champions League squad . Genoa Following the expiration of his contract at Inter , Crespo was quickly snapped up by Genoa , taking Diego Milito \\'s place , who moved in the opposite direction . On 8 June 2009 , it was reported that Crespo had a medical check to formalize his transfer . Crespo cited his ambition to make the Argentina 2010 World Cup squad as one of his key reasons for making the move to Genoa . On 13 September , Crespo scored his first goal of the 2009 season against Napoli . Return to Parma and retirement In January 2010 , Crespo returned to Parma after the club agreed the deal with Atalanta and Genoa . Crespo replaced Nicola Amoruso who left for Atalanta , while Atalanta \\'s Robert Acquafresca moved to Genoa to replace Crespo . The Argentine striker returned after ten years to Parma . Crespo scored just once before the season \\'s end , against Livorno . The striker enjoyed a more successful 2010–11 season , scoring 11 goals . In doing so , he became Parma \\'s top scorer for a fourth time , which remains a post-war club record . Despite mounting speculation of his departure , Crespo signed a one-year contract extension on 30 June 2011 . However , a lack of first-team opportunities saw Crespo and Parma mutually agree to terminate his contract on 2 February 2012 , although he did vow to return to the city he had fallen in love with . He is the club \\'s all-time record goalscorer with 94 goals in 201 appearances . Although Crespo was signed to play in Bengal Premier League Soccer in late January 2012 , with a salary of £533,000 for the two-month tournament , the competition never got underway . He clarified that his career as a footballer had finished in November 2012 . International career Crespo won his first cap for Argentina in a friendly match against Bulgaria in February 1995 . He was a member of the Argentina side that finished runners-up in the 1995 King Fahd Cup , the predecessor to the FIFA Confederations Cup . In 1996 , Crespo was a member of the Argentina men \\'s football squad for the Olympic Games . Crespo helped take Argentina to the final with braces against Spain in the quarter-final and Portugal in the semi-final . However , Argentina lost the final to Nigeria , despite Crespo scoring his sixth goal of the tournament from the penalty spot . Crespo scored his first goal for the Argentina senior team in a 1998 World Cup qualifier against Ecuador and hit a hat-trick against FR Yugoslavia in a pre-World Cup friendly . Crespo was called up to the final roster for the 1998 World Cup but only made one substitute appearance , as Gabriel Batistuta led the Argentine attack . Crespo \\'s attempt was saved by David Seaman in the second round penalty shoot-out with England , but Argentina progressed 4–3 . During qualification for the 2002 World Cup , Crespo was top scorer for Argentina with nine goals as they topped the South American group . During the finals , Batistuta was again preferred to Crespo as Argentina \\'s starting centre forward . Crespo appeared as a substitute in all three group matches , including the final match against Sweden , which Argentina needed to win in order to qualify for the second round . Though Crespo scored an 88th-minute equaliser , it was not to be enough and Argentina were eliminated . After the 2002 World Cup , Batistuta retired from international football , and Crespo took over as Argentina \\'s number 9 . During the 2006 World Cup qualifying stage , Crespo scored seven times , including two goals in Argentina \\'s 3–1 win over arch-rivals Brazil in Buenos Aires , which sealed qualification and made him Argentina \\'s career scoring leader in World Cup qualifiers . Crespo scored Argentina \\'s first goal of the 2006 World Cup in their opening match against the Ivory Coast . He also scored in the next game against Serbia and Montenegro ( 6–0 ) and the second round match against Mexico . However , Argentina \\'s run was ended as they were knocked out by host nation Germany on penalties in the quarter-final . Crespo \\'s final appearances for Argentina came at 2007 Copa América . He scored twice in Argentina \\'s 4–1 victory over the United States in their Group C opener , tying Diego Maradona \\'s team scoring record . He then overtook Maradona in Argentina \\'s second match , scoring a penalty kick against Colombia . However , he substituted immediately after converting the kick due to injury and missed the remainder of the tournament . After the Copa América , Crespo did not receive any further call-ups to the national team and ended his international career with 35 goals in 64 matches , being currently Argentina \\'s fourth highest goalscorer of all-time . Style of play Crespo was a fast , tenacious , powerful , and complete striker , who possessed good technique , composure in possession , and an eye for goal ; he also excelled in the air . A prolific and opportunistic goal-scorer , he was capable of finishing well both with his feet and with his head , and was known for his ability to score acrobatic goals . He was also effective off the ball due to his work-rate , tactical intelligence , and attacking movement , which he often used to provide depth for his team or create space for his teammates ; he was also capable of linking up well with other forwards . Due to his goalscoring ability and wide range of skills , he is regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation , and as one of Serie A \\'s best ever foreign players . Despite his ability , he faced several injuries throughout his career , which limited his playing time at times . Nicknames While commonly known as Hernán , Crespo was christened Hernando Jorge Crespo , after his grandfather of the same name . His most common nickname is \" Valdanito \" , after legendary compatriot striker Jorge Valdano , as he was thought to be his heir due to their similar appearance and eye for goal . He is also called , although less often , \" El Polaco \" ( or \" The Pole \" ) because his grandmother was Polish . Media Crespo was sponsored by sportswear company Nike and appeared in Nike commercials . In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan , Crespo starred in a \" Secret Tournament \" commercial ( branded \" Scorpion KO \" ) directed by Terry Gilliam , appearing alongside footballers such as Thierry Henry , Ronaldo , Francesco Totti , Ronaldinho , Luís Figo , Roberto Carlos and Hidetoshi Nakata , with former player Eric Cantona as the tournament \" referee \" . Post-playing and managerial career Coach : Parma and Modena On 12 November 2012 , Crespo announced that he would pursue a career in coaching and would begin work in early July 2013 . He served as youth coach for the Primavera team of Parma during the 2014–15 season . After the disbandment of Parma , on 30 June 2015 , Crespo was announced as the new manager of Serie B club Modena . He was sacked on 26 March 2016 , with the club one point above the relegation zone . Back to Parma On 22 June 2017 , Chinese businessman Jiang Lizhang bought 60 % of the stocks of Parma , and assigned Crespo as the new vice president of the club . He worked for Jiang \\'s company Desport as a technical adviser beforehand . On 2 January 2018 , with the club opting to remove the figure of vice-president from its board , Crespo was named new club ambassador . Banfield On 19 December 2018 , Crespo was appointed manager of Argentine Primera División side Banfield , on an 18-month deal . After finishing 16th in his first season , he was sacked five games into the next in September 2019 , having won just one of those games . Defensa y Justicia On 25 January 2020 , Crespo was appointed manager of Defensa y Justicia , also in the Argentine top tier . On 23 January 2021 , he led Defensa y Justicia to their first international trophy by winning the Copa Sudamericana after defeating Club Atlético Lanús by 3–0 . São Paulo On 12 February 2021 , Crespo was appointed manager of Brazilian Série A club São Paulo on a two-year deal . He made his debut 16 days later on the first day of the Campeonato Paulista , in a 1–1 home draw with Botafogo-SP . He won the title on 23 May , after a 2–0 aggregate victory over Palmeiras ; this was the club \\'s first honour in nine years and the first in the competition since 2005 . On 13 October 2021 , Crespo left São Paulo on a mutual agreement . The club were 13th in the national league after 25 games , and he was replaced by team icon Rogério Ceni . Personal life In May 2005 , Crespo married equestrian Alessia Andra Rossi , with whom he has three children . She is Romanian .

Football is in theory a very simple game , as illustrated by Kevin Keegan \\'s famous assertion that his tactics for winning a match were to \" score more goals than the opposition \" . However , well-organised and well-prepared teams are often seen beating teams with supposedly more skillful players , even over time . Coaching manuals and books generally cover not only individual skills but tactics as well . Some of the tactics include using a 4-4-2 formation ( signifying 4 defenders , 4 midfielders and 2 strikers ) which is often regarded as the standard formation , a formation of 5-4-1 which is more defensive and a 4-3-3 formation which allows for more attacking play . General principles Width and depth are both principles of offence and defence as follows : Width in attack : The attacker tries to divide the defence by spreading strike points across a broad front , rather than attempting to force advances through narrow channels . This may involve play from the wings , or rapidly shifting into open lanes/open space when approaching the goal . Mainly using wingers , often gaps are made between defenders using the width . These gaps can be used to feed the ball to strikers . Width in defence : The defender counters , trying to contract and deny width . Attackers are \" shepherded \" or channeled into narrower or more crowded avenues of approach Depth in attack : The attacker uses depth by moving men up from the rear , but may use a constant \" target striker \" or front man to always be present deep in the defence . Depth in defence : The defender also uses depth by marking supporting players in the opposing team , and holding back a man as cover for more advanced players , sometimes in a \" sweeper \" or \" libero \" role . Therefore , the attacking player with the ball wo n\\'t have anyone open for a pass . Alternatively , defenders may abandon depth temporarily to set an offside trap . Balance in defence : The defence attempts balanced coverage of vulnerable space . Defenders do not simply cluster on the right side for example , just because the ball is there at that time . Attacking tactics Attacking Pass and move : This is the most basic team tactic — as soon as the ball has come into possession of the player , they need to be quick to decide whether to pass it or not . If they do n\\'t pass it immediately , they need to move with it ; if they do pass it , they again need to move along , following the general ball movement . This can also be used to mean that once a player has passed the ball he does not remain stationary but moves into a position where he can receive the ball again and give more options to the player in possession . Give and go ( or combination passing ) : This is a basic tactic which is essentially the same as \\'pass and move \\' , and is an essential part of the \\'target man \\' style of play ( see below ) . The player in possession of the ball plays a pass to a teammate and then immediately seeks to move into space . If the player who passed the ball can \\'lose \\' his defensive marker ( either through pace , movement , superior fitness or a lack of awareness on the part of the defender ) he could then be free to receive a return pass and advance towards and possibly threaten the goal . When the ball is played by the receiving player immediately back to the first player this is known as a \\'One-Two \\' ( in British parlance ) Switching the attack : Using a \\'square \\' or \\'cross \\' pass across the whole width of the pitch to a player in plenty of space is a very effective way of both relieving pressure and building a fresh attack . The defending team will be required to adjust its positions and this usually creates spaces which can be exploited . In this example , the player numbered 1 has moved out of position , allowing more space for the opposing player . By playing the ball to the other side ( the curved line represents an aerial pass ) , the recipient of the pass finds themselves in space which can be exploited . The through ball ( slide rule pass ) : Using the space behind the opponent \\'s defensive line : Passes into this area have a number of pros : If an attacking player reaches the pass , taking care to avoid offside , he may get a 1-on-1 challenge with the goalkeeper , or be in an excellent position for a flank attack . Even if a defender reaches the pass first , the outcome could still be good for the attacking team . The defender will face his own goal , which could prompt him to give away a corner kick or a throw-in , make a risky pass to his team \\'s goalkeeper , or being put under heavy pressure near the corner flag . Typically , teams with faster attackers than the opponent \\'s defenders will try challenging this space , while the defending team in these cases will want to keep their defenders low when defending in order to give away as little space as possible between the defenders and the goalkeeper . The long through ball : This is a long , and usually high , pass from a teams \\' own half , over the heads of the other team \\'s defence . It is intended for the attacking players to chase and it is important that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked . The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of winning back the ball , taking control over it , and eventually getting a shot on goal . In the diagram , the ball ( red line ) is played in front of the furthermost forward , the dotted blue line showing their run . In this example , a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders ( black team ) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small . Using the space between the opponent \\'s defensive line and midfielder line ( \\'the hole \\' ) : A common build-up of attacks is to pass the ball into the space between the opponent \\'s defenders and midfielders . Normally , an attacker with his back to the goal will receive the pass . He will seek to turn with the ball , or distribute it to a player facing the goal , who optimally also is in front of the opponent \\'s midfielders - or even on the move into the space behind the opponent \\'s defenders . Triangular movement : This is a movement tactic that allows a safe and quick shifting of the offensive flanks while maintaining control of the ball . In a triangular play the ball is passed between three players to form a triangle . The triangle is then shifted to a different position when a new player is added . Many triangles can be created with various combinations of players with the intention of slowly moving the ball forward and never really compromising possession . This tactic works well when trying to gain control in the midfield . However , it can also be used for pure attacking purposes . The effectiveness of this tactic lies in the fact that defenders are unable to quickly \\'adapt \\' to the other attacker \\'s style of play . Swapping of the wing men : Sometimes , a team with two flexible ( position wise ) wide men will allow them to interchange as the game progresses . The aim of this is to confuse the defenders who are assigned to mark them , thus maybe leading to opportunities as the defender tries to find their man in set pieces ( corners , free kicks etc. , where the man may be in a totally different position and thus evade his grasp ) . Also , if the wingers are different types of player ( one favouring crossing from deep positions whilst the other is prone to trying to dribble past their marker for example ) , then it might be to exploit a weakness in the opposing defender . Strong side overloads : An offensive attack can pressure the defense on to one side of the pitch by running most of its attackers and midfielders to one side letting a wing player or defender come to the opposite side with little or no coverage . The ball is then crossed or passed to that unmarked player for a free or near free shot . Using a target man : This tactic is useful when the team possesses a quality striker who has the ability of taking on the whole defence on his own . He will usually occupy two defenders , thus making the defence more vulnerable . Combined with two fast wingers , this tactic may give the 4-man defence potential problems . The team may also benefit from a target man at set pieces . The target man , can use give/go tactics described earlier , can attempt to \" knock down \" high passes to teammates or can simply try to outpower and outmuscle opposition defenders to create scoring opportunities for himself . Alan Shearer , Duncan Ferguson , Chris Sutton , Luca Toni , Nikola Žigić , Zlatan Ibrahimović , Peter Crouch , Didier Drogba , Miroslav Klose , Troy Deeney and Aleksandar Mitrović are all examples of strikers adept at playing this role . Set pieces Free kicks Free kicks and dead-ball restarts come into play following a foul or other infractions . Indirect free kicks must be touched by another player before any shot is taken . Direct free kicks can be made directly on goal . Offensive players attempt numerous tricks to beat the defenders , who often form a solid wall of players directly in front of the goal . Attackers may attempt to blast the ball through the defensive wall , or curl it over or around using spin . A less common idea is to hit the ball powerfully and straight along the floor , since the defenders in the wall usually jump to try and prevent a shot being lifted over their heads . However , this tactic has become less effective in the modern game , as defending teams usually assign one player to lie down behind the wall to block any low attempts . David Beckham , Juninho , Siniša Mihajlović , Ronaldinho , Zico , Andrea Pirlo , Pierre van Hooijdonk , Neymar , Roberto Carlos , Francesco Totti , Lionel Messi , Álvaro Recoba , Cristiano Ronaldo , Rivaldo , Juan Román Riquelme , Steven Gerrard , Wayne Rooney , Sejad Salihović , Rogério Ceni , Michel Platini , Alessandro Del Piero , Thierry Henry , Roberto Baggio , Diego Maradona , Frank Lampard , Leighton Baines , Wesley Sneijder , Luis Suárez , Christian Eriksen , Reto Ziegler Miralem Pjanić , Trent Alexander-Arnold and Gareth Bale are widely known to score from free kick positions . Throw-ins How throw-ins are best handled depends on where it is : In one \\'s own half the aim of a throw-in may be to retain possession in order to build up the next attack . The throw may or may not go toward the opponents \\' goal ; the most unmarked player may be a full-back who is behind the ball . Such a throw followed by a quickly taken \\'switch \\' pass can be an effective tactic . Under pressure however , the ball is often thrown up the line , toward the opponents \\' goal line to gain as much ground as possible . If the thrower is unmarked , a simple tactic is to take a short throw to the feet or chest of a marked player who immediately returns the ball to the thrower . In the last third of the pitch a player with a long throw can put pressure onto the defenders by throwing the ball deep into the opponents \\' penalty area , resulting in somewhat similar tactics to a corner kick or a free kick situation , but with the added advantage of avoiding the offside trap that could be used by opponents in a free kick , as an attacking player can not be offside from a throw in ( the same applies for corner kicks ) . Players well known for their long throwing skills are Rory Delap , Giorgio Chiellini and Morten Gamst Pedersen . Goal kicks A goal kick is an important \\'set piece \\' that will occur many times in a game and yet few teams practice it . If taken quickly the kick may be taken short to a full-back who has run into a wide position . Although this may gain little ground it retains the all-important possession of the ball . A longer kick to the midfield is more common and it is vital that the midfield unit are in a position to receive it . Some goalkeepers may take advantage of no offside rule while taking a Goal Kick to quickly pass the ball to a striker while the opposite team is still repositioning . One of the best examples of this tactic is Ederson Moraes of Manchester City , who often takes advantage of his strong and precise long kick to catch the opposition off guard . Corners A corner kick ( or \" corner \" ) is a real goal scoring opportunity and it is essential to know who is the best at taking a good corner from both the left and right side of the pitch . A good corner will be aimed high across the goal and may be \\'bent \\' towards or away from the goal . At least one of the forwards should be on or close to the goal line when the kick is taken . Another tactic on a corner is to let the best shooter stay in the back \" trash \" position and have the defence worried about those up front . The player taking the corner kick makes a small pass back to the trash shooter who has time and space to take a good shot . Defensive tactics All eleven players on the pitch have a defensive role . Which roles they are assigned , depends on tactics . In principle , there are two ways of defending , zone defence and man-to-man defence . In a zone defence , defensive players mainly move in relation to each other , whereas a man-to-man defence mainly moves in relation to opposing players . Whenever defensive players are given , or give themselves , a larger degree of freedom , hybrids of the two are seen . First , second and third defenders The first defender has the main responsibility for what the opponent in possession does , seeking to obstruct dangerous passes . The initial few seconds after a team has lost the ball are important , as the newly-defending team in these seconds will be poorly organised defensively . Wise first defending will contribute to the defending team managing to organise before the opponents attack . The first defender should usually be the player closest to the opponent holding possession , but needs to be at the defending side of him in order to do an effective job . He or she should keep a distance of about two metres , although the ideal distance will vary with each situation . The point is to pressure the opponent as much as possible without giving him a large possibility of a dribble . As a dribble is n\\'t as dangerous when the defending team is well organised , the distance may be shorter in these cases . Analogously , the distance should be increased if the defence is poorly organised . In certain cases , the first defender should attempt a tackle . Often , however , this will increase the probability of being dribbled and passed . The direction in which to move towards the opponent with possession of the ball may be the shortest direction . However , it may be of value to curve the defensive run , in order to channel ( also called \" show \" ) the opponent in a certain direction . If the defensive team is well organised , he should be channelled ( \" shown \" ) towards the centre of the pitch . In the case of temporarily poor defensive organisation , however , he should be channelled towards the line . The second defender is for security if the first defender is passed . In that case , he takes over as first defender , and ideally one of the third defenders takes over as second defender . The team should be organised in a manner to make this transition as fast as possible . The typical ideal distance between the second and first defender is about six metres , but this will vary strongly from situation to situation . The most important factor is the opponent \\'s speed . If he is moving fast , the distance should be longer . If he is standing still , the second and first defender may in some cases join forces and work as two first defenders . The job of the third defender is to provide deep cover . He is generally in a stand-off position relative to the first and second defenders and tries to view the \" big picture \" , keeping watch for new opponents moving up , and covering vulnerable gaps if the first and second defenders are bypassed . The sweeper role is sometimes conceived as that of a third defender , but every defensive player not immediately engaging the ball has the obligation to adjust his positioning to guard against dangerous situations and to plug vulnerable gaps . While the role of first and second defenders are rather similar , the third defenders \\' role is very different in zone defence and man-to-man defence . Also , their organisation will vary with formation . The zone defence In zone defence , second and third defenders and midfielders are organised in two lines , in the transverse direction of the field , thus organising a defender line and a midfielder line , the midfielder line working as an \" outer shield \" for the defenders . The lines should be as straight as possible , although the first defender and in some cases the second defender may rush out of it to pressure the opponent with the ball . A straight line of defenders may prevent spaces behind some of them due to the offside rule . Also , even in zone defence , some opponents , for example those moving into dangerous space , may temporarily need to be marked . The man-to-man defence ideology holds that almost all opponents need to be marked at all times , although they will have to keep an eye on zone considerations as well , and usually a sweeper will be given a free defensive role . In practice , however , every defence will be a mix of zone defence and a man-to-man defence , although often with heavy leanings towards one or the other . The number of players in the defender and midfielder lines is given by the number of football formations . Some formations use midfield anchors to stop attacks between the two lines . Attackers usually also play a role in pressurising defenders , in order to give them less time to find good passing alternatives . The lines should be shifted sideways depending where the ball is . The third defenders should keep a sensible distance to each other , depending on the width the opponent \\'s attacking players are distributed in . Depth considerations The distance between the defender line and the midfielder line should be kept constant at about 15 metres . However , the defensive line should back up and thus increase this distance , stand off , when there is no pressure on the opponent in possession , as this increases the possibility of a through ball . With tough pressure on the opponent , the distance may be reduced to below 15 metres . Also , as opponents move in close to the penalty area , the defending team will be forced to move their midfielders ever closer to their defenders . When organised , the defending team will offer no resistance until the attacking team has advanced to a certain height on the pitch . The pressure height , or at which depth the midfielders should start acting as first and second defenders , depends on a lot of factors . For example , as higher pressure is more tiring , it demands players with good stamina . In general , a defensive-minded team will tend to stay lower , thus diminishing defensive risks as opponents get less space . This however , also gives them a longer way to the goal in the event of a break and counter-attack , making the long through ball a typical alternative . The man-to-man defence In a man-to-man defence system , a single defender follows his opponent wherever he goes . Extremely tight marking can be achieved in this way and star players can often be neutralised in a game by use of a dedicated \" shadow \" . Since the man-to-man defence will take defenders in any part of the field , interceptions and broken plays will often offer opportunity for quick counter-attack . The Italian teams of the 1970s and 1980s often used this approach with impressive results . The weakness of the man-to-man defence is depth when fresh attackers move up . The man-to-man defence also allows defenders to be drawn out of position , opening gaps for other attackers in vulnerable areas . This was Italy \\'s fatal weakness in the 1970 Final , according to some analysts . To overcome this problem with depth , the man to man defence may use a \\'sweeper \\' , who is a central defender and has a free role , i.e . has not been assigned a player to mark . He sometimes takes up a position slightly behind the other defenders , as his defensive role often is to \\'sweep up \\' any attacks that break through the defence and as such he adds valuable depth to the defensive unit . Usually the sweeper will be the controller of the defence . They will determine where the back line should be at any given time . Zone defence does not require a sweeper role , and as many teams have changed their tactics on this , sweepers are today rare . Defending at set pieces Free-kicks from short range At free-kicks from short range , particularly when defending a direct free-kick , a wall of defensive players is lined up . The number of players who form the wall depends on the angle and distance from the goal , the opponent \\'s assumed shooting skills , and the need to mark opponents to whom the ball might be passed . The wall is usually set up at the direction of the defending goalkeeper to block a direct shot at the near post . The goalkeeper is normally positioned nearer the far post . In order to increase the difficulty for the free-kick taker to kick the ball over the wall and into the goal it is common for the players in the wall to jump vertically when the kick is taken . Defending indirect free-kicks provides different difficulties for the defending team . The wall must be prepared to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker , and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team \\'s practised set-plays . Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill . Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective . Corner kicks and other crosses At corner kicks , and at direct free kick , indirect free kick or throw-ins that are likely to become a cross , most teams use man-on-man marking , even those which otherwise play zone defence . Each player is given an opponent to mark , in advanced football they usually have been assigned an opponent before the match . Substituting at the time of a defensive set piece is regarded as unwise , as play may be started before the substitute has come into marking position . A few teams use the tactic of gathering defenders on one line on corner kicks and similar situations , in effect giving them the responsibility for zones instead of particular opponents . Penalty kicks In the case of a penalty kick , no defending players except the goalkeeper are allowed within the penalty area or within ten yards of the penalty spot and 18 yards of the goal line . A significant number of players should , however , be placed right outside the penalty area , alert to advance into the area and clear any deflection . For this purpose , sometimes the attacking team will nominate two players to run at the goal from either side of the penalty spot ; timing their run so that they only enter the penalty area once the kick has been taken will hopefully give them the first opportunity at gathering the ball if it is saved by the goalkeeper . This tactic is rarely seen , however , since the likelihood of the ball being saved and then falling into the path of the attacking player is small . A particular tactic that can be used by the goalkeeper involves trying to distract the penalty taker by drawing his concentration away from striking the ball cleanly . Such tactics normally involve moving one \\'s body , or body parts , in an extravagant manner , or through verbal comments . Famous examples of where this worked successfully include Bruce Grobbelaar in the 1984 European Cup final , and Jerzy Dudek in the 2005 Champions League Final . \" Forward \" versus \" collapsing \" defences Some teams use forward defending , aggressively challenging the ball when on the defensive in any part of the field . Others rely on a \" collapsing \" style , that falls back deep into its own half when the opponent is in possession of the ball . The \" forward \" policy can put immense physical and psychological pressure on opponents , and is aimed at slowing down or breaking up attacks early . It has more physical demands however , and may spread a defensive formation more thinly . The \" collapsing \" approach is more economical in physical demand , and provides a packed back zone to thwart attacks . However it sometimes creates large gaps in midfield , and invites the opposing team to dribble forward and to take shots from long range ; if the opposing team is good at the two aforementioned skills then goals will be conceded freely . The most extreme form of \" forward \" defending , Gegenpressing ( , \" counter-pressing \" ) , invented by Ralf Rangnick and exemplified by teams managed by German managers such as Jürgen Klopp and Thomas Tuchel , requires each attacker to press the opposition immediately upon loss of possession . Defending with the ball Clearing is when the player in possession of the ball is pressed hard , often near his own goal , and chooses to shoot the ball away with low precision simply in order to get out of a dangerous situation . When opponent pressure is extremely high , the ball is often cleared to a corner kick or to a throw-in . Clearing long , but into opponent control , may give the defence time and the opportunity to organise , including setting up the correct formation and pressure height . If the attack was high up the field , such as in or near the penalty area , defenders will thus quickly push out , and attackers will then be forced to retreat in order to avoid offside in the next move . Clearing may be combined with an attempt to hit a long pass or a long through ball . Players high up in the field who are pressed hard , and who are eager to avoid a counter-attack , may in some instances combine clearing with a shot . A team composed of good passers and mobile players with good positioning skills may more often try to avoid clearing , as their skills make it easier to make shorter passes and thus retaining possession until they get out of a difficult situation . Retaining possession in this way may also be regarded as a longer-term way of defending , as the opposing team can not attack when they do n\\'t have the ball . With the ball , the team applying this tactic can simply pass the ball between each other - as in the possession football style , but with little or no intention of building up an attack , thus decreasing the risk of a break . The major benefits of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents . Meanwhile , by knocking the ball around , opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire . And should an opportunity suddenly arise , defence may be quickly switched to attack . A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high , short passes between the players are required . This significantly narrows the gap between the attack , midfield and defence ( usually , the latter is forced to push up ) . So if the opponent gains possession , a long ball could effectively open up the defence . Similarly , if it is the attack and midfield that need to drop back , the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back . Substitutions In FIFA competitive 11-a-side matches , teams are allowed to make up to five substitutions during the game . The rules of the competition state that all players and substitutes be named before kick-off and anyone not named in the starting lineup who takes to the field of play is considered a substitution . In non-competitive matches , the use of substitutes must be determined before the match begins , except in friendly international matches , where no more than six substitutes may be brought on . The most tired players are generally substituted , but only if their substitutes are well trained to fill in the same role , or if the formation is transformed at the same time to accommodate for the substitution . Coaches often refrain from substituting defensive players in order not to disrupt the defensive posture of the team . Instead , they often replace ineffective attackers or unimaginative midfielders in order to freshen up the attacking posture and increase their chances of scoring . For a team that is losing a game , a fresh striker can bring more benefit in circumventing an opposed defence line composed of relatively tired players . For a team that is winning a game , a fresh midfielder or a defender can bring more benefit in strengthening the defence against the opposition \\'s attackers ( who may be fresh substitutes themselves ) . In this situation , it is usually imaginative attacking flair players who are replaced by tough-tackling defensive midfielders or defenders . Injured players may also need to be substituted . For each injured player who must be substituted , the team loses one more opportunity to influence things later in the game to their favour . Notable examples Football coaches and technical manuals such as Soccer Skills and tactics , and The Soccer Coaching Bible , often use visual symbols and diagrams to demonstrate the principles described above , and to link principles to historical games . The following examples combine technical coaching observations with championship play descriptions at the World Cup level as in Brian Glanville \\'s World Cup , ( 1994 ) . The written descriptions are diagrammed for the reader to better understand various football tactics and skills as they are applied in the real world , at the highest levels . Combined team play using width and depth : Brazil vs Italy , 1970 Final Beating a defence using width and depth . Astute use of the principles of width and depth led to the final goal of the 1970 World Cup , considered by many to be the best combined team effort in Cup history . Almost all the players of Brazil touched the ball in this effort that penetrated one of the tightest defences ever seen , the famous Italian catenaccio \" padlock \" defence . The Italians used four defenders , plus a sweeper , Pierluigi Cera , behind the \" back four . \" They relied on a counter-attacking game , deploying three midfielders and two strikers , and closely marked opponents man to man . This tight system however involved a \" collapsing \" approach that while packing the Italian penalty area and denying the Brazilian forwards much space , left relatively large gaps in midfield . See \" Standing Off \" defensive discussion above . Brazil \\'s superb skills exploited this weakness , showing especially that any defence ( whether man to man , zone or other variants ) can be beaten using the principles of both width and depth . The weakness of the man to man system was also exposed . Italian left back Giacinto Facchetti dedicated himself to winger Jairzinho , shadowing him tightly wherever he went . Jairzinho cunningly moved off the right flank , opening gaps for others to follow as can be seen below . See \" Switching the attack \" and \" Swapping wing men \" above for discussion of this aspect of offensive tactics . Italian defence pulled left in quick sequence . Brazilian midfielder Clodoaldo began the move with a weaving dribble out to the left flank , that beat three men and essentially pulled the Italian defence in that direction . A fatal gap was thus eventually opened up for the run of fullback Carlos Alberto Torres on the right . Clodoaldo eased the ball to the Rivelino moving up on the left . Rivellino quickly played the ball forward to Jairzinho , who crossed the field to appear on the left flank . Movement in center \" freezes \" Italian defence . Almost without pause the powerful Jairzinho began a weaving run . Facchetti played Jairzinho well , backing off the ball , and squeezing him inside where it was more crowded . Good defenders will \" channel \" ( see discussion above ) an attacker into areas with less space . So far , all seemed safe for Italy . Facchetti covered well , as did the other Italian defenders . There were two extra men as insurance in the back as Jairzinho began his run . Depth is also a principle of defence , and the sweeper system ( or other arrangements ) provides such . As Jairzinho accelerated , the ever dangerous striker Tostão began a sprint up the middle , drawing his defender with him , diverting the Italian defence and making more room for Jairzinho . Younger players should note the movement off the ball by Brazil . Increasingly squeezed inside , Jairzinho \\'s run nevertheless drew the defence to him and he eased the ball to Pelé in the centre . Always dangerous , Pelé paused and shaped to make a dribble . Overlapping defender exploits principle of depth to cap the move . For the Italian defence , there was still no cause for undue alarm . Pelé seemed well covered , and there was still the sweeper at the back as insurance behind the defence . Nevertheless , Pelé \\'s feint , combined with the previous moves , kept Italian focus frozen in the middle , attracting the attention of three men , and he casually slipped the ball right- to Carlos Alberto who was thundering up from the rear , totally unmarked . Pelé played the ball well ahead of Alberto , using space intelligently , so that the fast fullback ran on and shot without pausing , in full stride , smashing the ball into the Italian net . So effective was Brazil \\'s use of width , that no Italian defender is even within reasonable striking distance of Alberto until the last moment . The principle of width stretched and drew the Italian defence . The principle of depth—fresh men moving up from the rear—allowed Brazil to exploit the gaps created by width . Penetration and envelopment in attack : Banks versus Pelé , Mexico 1970 Penetration in attack- the forward or through pass : To the footballer , the penetration pass is one of the first methods learned in attack , whether it be the simple \" kick and chase \" of the youth leagues , or the exquisite through-balls by today \\'s world class stars . Penetration by pass is the quickest method of advancing the ball towards the enemy goal . When well executed , it can yield spectacular results . Penetration in attack however requires more than mere passing . Players without the ball must move into space , and must time their runs so as not to be caught offside . Envelopment in attack : the central cross . Attacking an opposing side from the flanks using crosses from the wings is among the oldest and most effective football tactics . An attack from the flanks uses width to stretch an opposing defence creating gaps in the goal area to be exploited . While the direction of the lateral cross is not as straightforward as the through-ball , both types of passes serve to split an enemy defence , in view of striking at the vital central area of the goal . This example , the legendary confrontation between keeper Gordon Banks of England and Pelé of Brazil , captures the two types of attack in one snapshot . It also serves to illustrate the difficulties in defending against both types of passes . Two pass types - one great defensive save . The powerful running of Brazil \\'s right winger Jairzinho set the stage , with initial direction by captain Carlos Alberto . Sprinting down the flank , Jairzinho pounced on an excellent through pass from Alberto , accelerated past Cooper the English back , and lofted a high arcing cross to Pelé in the centre . Pelé headed down powerfully and was already raising his arms in triumph when Banks leaped to his right \" like a salmon over a fall \" Pelé said later , and somehow flailed the bouncing ball over the crossbar , saving a sure goal . The Brazilian forward said it was the greatest save he had ever seen . Offensively , this play demonstrates how both types of passes can divide and stretch a defence . Jairzinho \\'s running and cross was set up by an excellent forward pass , and his centre to Pelé capped a move that should have resulted in a goal , were it not for the extraordinary skill of English keeper , Gordon Banks . Offside traps are one way to defend against both pass types , but the ultimate solution is defensive depth and sound goalkeeping . The two-man combination Using the two-man combination . The 2-man combination pass , variously called the wall pass , the \" one-two \" , the \" give and go \" and other local names , is among the simplest yet most powerful team techniques in football . It requires a fair level of individual skill to pull off , yet this should not stop coaches from introducing it early in the higher youth leagues , nor should players from these leagues neglect it in favour of the all too easy \" kick and chase \" . There are two ways to execute it : ( a ) pass and run to space for the return pass without pausing or ( b ) pass then pause briefly to gauge opposing reaction before running into an open spot for the return . In tight conditions , the first method is better , while the second can be used where there is a bit more space to operate . Power of the two-man combination : Netherlands vs Brazil , 1974 . Simple as it is , the 2-man move can penetrate the teeth of the densest , most negative opposition . Peru brought it to a high art on the World Cup stage in 1970 , under their coach Didi , Brazil \\'s former midfield general of 1958 and 1962 . Time after time Peruvian forwards like Cubillas , Gallardo , and Sotil put a central combination on the floor that sliced through the opposition and created countless dangerous situations . The Dutch team of 1974 were also disciples of the two-man combination . The diagram here shows the first Dutch goal in the 1974 game that crushed Brazil \\'s repeat championship hopes - product of an exchange between Johan Neeskens and Johan Cruyff . A two-man move also set up the second goal for Cruyff in the game . Contrast with the \" hand \" of Diego Maradona below . Potential of the two-man combination : Maradona \\'s \" Hand of God \" goal – 1986 . The example shown below , the first goal of Diego Maradona against England in 1986 , is used to illustrate the potential of the move . Argentina utilised it frequently , being ideally suited to their crisp , quick , short passing style . As he had often done during the game , Maradona initiated the sequence with a quick dribbling run into the packed central area . Surrounded , he began a 2-man combo pass - slipping the ball to Jorge Valdano on the right , and then moving up for the reply . Valdano pivoted and attempted to return , but conditions were too tight . Hodge , the English midfielder , intercepted and rather dangerously , attempted to tap the ball back to his keeper , Shilton . The rest is well known . Maradona and Shilton raced towards the floating ball , which connected with Maradona \\'s hand ( the so-called \" Hand of God \" goal ) , past Shilton , into the goal . While much controversy still surrounds the goal , Maradona \\'s run illustrates how even the tightest conditions can be pried open with the two-man exchange . It also illustrates how the simple two-man combination can create countless dangerous situations and force opponents into making errors . The three-man move Effectiveness of three-man strike teams . The three-man move is another very effective weapon in the attacking arsenal . It is distinguished from simple passing between players in that the initiator of the move finishes it with a shot on goal or a well-placed pass leading to a shot . It is thus a collaboration of three distinct players . Famous three-man strike teams are legendary in football , from the earliest days , through the famous Hungarian sides of the 1950s , to the \" clockwork orange \" of the Dutch masters in the 1970s , through the German , Italian , French , Argentinian , Brazilian , and other teams of the contemporary era . The three-man package can be more effective than the two-man combo because it gives more attacking options and causes more confusion in the defence . The initial pass can not be quickly cut off as in the two-man manoeuvre which really has only one option . Typically the second pass in the three-man move lures and diverts defenders on to false ground . This gives the initiator of the sequence time to run into an advantageous position . Triple player collaborations of course do not operate in isolation – they have other supporting players – but the tight three-man exchange still remains a fundamental pillar of successful attacking play . Brazil vs Uruguay 1970 – strike package : Jairzinho – Pelé – Tostão . The example below , is drawn from one of the most famous strike teams in World Cup history- Pelé , Tostão and Jairzinho . This goal , against Uruguay in the 1970 semi-final , captures the power of the move . The fast winger Jairzinho set the stage- dribbling down the right flank before finding Pelé ahead . Tightly marked , and with his back to the goal , Pelé immediately played a subtle pass to Tostão . The Brazilian center-forward drew the defence to him with a short dribble before finding Jairzinho again on the wing . This exchange of passes gave Jairzinho a lead on other defenders and he made the most of it – accelerating down the wing , selling a dummy ( letting the ball run after pretending to stop and play it ) on Uruguayan defender Matosas , and muscling him aside as he approached the enemy goal . Uruguayan keeper Mazurkiewicz came off his line but it was simply too late , as Jairzinho slotted the ball into the net . Of note in this sequence is the attacking space created by the tight exchanges between Jairzinho , Pelé , and Tostão . Even the Uruguayans , playing one of the most densely packed , solid defences seen in a World Cup could not stop it . Jairzinho is surrounded by opposing defenders when the sequence starts , but at the end , he only has one to deal with . Also of note is the unselfish passing of Brazilian striker Tostão , with his skill creating countless openings for his teammates throughout the 1970 tournament . The quick long-ball counter-attack Counter attacking Football involves a team withdrawing players into their own half but ensuring that one or two players are committed to the attack . One such example is the quick counter-strike mounted by England against Germany in the 1970 World Cup . Defensive midfielder Alan Mullery began the move , lofting a long through pass over the heads of three German defenders , to Newton on the right flank . Not pausing to admire his handiwork , Mullery kept moving up . Newton , a defensive player was placed in an excellent attacking position with few opponents to check his progress . Newton advanced on a short dribble , before producing a low , outstanding diagonal cross that found Mullery , who had sprinted into the goalmouth . Mullery finished what he had started , by driving the ball home past the German goalkeeper Sepp Maier . Tactically , this goal combines the power of the long pass with that of the two-man combination , and indeed , before his pass to Newton , Mullery had exchanged passes with Francis Lee before setting off on his final combination run . This move was pulled off by two normally defensively oriented players , showing that the long-ball counter-strike can be successful from a deep position on the field with any combination of skilled players . Free-kicks and set-pieces Indirect free-kicks can throw a defence into confusion when taken quickly , or in unexpected directions . The third goal of Brazil \\'s 1970 World Cup victory over Italy illustrates the method . Brazil \\'s midfield general Gerson Nunes approached rapidly and lofted the dead ball in a high arc almost from the midfield line . It found Pelé perfectly positioned near the Italian goal . The Brazilian headed down softly and accurately , straight into the path of the onrushing winger Jairzinho , who virtually walked the ball into the net . Italy \\'s catenaccio defence was caught out of position here , not only failing to neutralise Pelé , but providing little cover to stop Jairzinho . A rapid , daring set-piece kick will often accomplish this unbalancing of defences . Direct free-kicks are a key part of attacking in football , and can lead to many goals . Numerous feints and ruses are tried to fool the opposition , including having attackers join the \" wall . \" A successful free kick from the 1970 World Cup- Brazil vs Czechoslovakia , illustrates how the technique works . Brazilian forwards Jairzinho and Tostao cunningly joined the end of the defensive wall as the Czechs set it up . As Pelé backed off and feinted as if to take the kick , both Jair and Tostão began to move off , creating space . Roberto Rivelino ghosted in from the side to shoot powerfully into the gap for a goal . Moving into space – the diagonal run Moving into free space is one of the most critical skills that football players must develop . Attacking players must move off the ball into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success . Passes to space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to receive the ball and do something constructive with it . Skilled players are able to find seams between defenders , positioning themselves to receive a pass . This diagram shows a productive use of space by West Germany in the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final which led to Gerd Müller \\'s game-winning goal against the Netherlands . German midfielder Rainer Bonhof made a long diagonal run out to the right side of the field , putting put him clear of the Dutch opposition . Deep into the Dutch half , Bonhof received a ball from Jürgen Grabowski and beat Arie Haan . Bonhof sent a low cross in to Müller , who found the back of the net . Moving diagonally is one of the best offensive movements , whether at the near or far posts , or out to the wings farther back in midfield . Diagonal movement creates added space to maneuver , compared to simply running straight ahead or laterally . It also means that players must be willing to switch positions as the situation demands .

Football/Soccer Ball Skills Wiki', 'Pedro Telmo Zarraonandía Montoya ( 20 January 1921 – 23 February 2006 ) , known as Zarra ( , ) , was a Spanish football forward . He spent the majority of his career at Athletic Bilbao , from 1940 to 1955 , for whom he remains the top scorer in competitive matches with 335 goals . Zarra signed for Athletic after playing one season for Erandio . He became a prolific goalscorer in his 15 seasons at the club , winning the Pichichi Trophy as the highest scorer in La Liga on six occasions . During his career , Zarra scored a total of 251 league goals , a Spanish record that lasted nearly six decades before being broken by Lionel Messi . His 81 goals in the Copa del Rey remain a record . Despite his goalscoring records , he only played for Spain 20 times . Even so , he still managed to score 20 goals , including four in one match as Spain beat Switzerland 6–3 on 18 February 1951 . He also scored his country \\'s winning goal against England in the 1950 World Cup finals as Spain reached the final four—their best performance in the competition until winning the 2010 FIFA World Cup 60 years later . After leaving Athletic in 1955 , he played for one year with SD Indautxu and another with Barakaldo CF before retiring . He died of a heart attack on 24 February 2006 , aged 85 . The Zarra Trophy for the highest-scoring Spaniard in La Liga is awarded in his memory . Life Childhood and first steps Zarra was born on 20 January 1921 at the Asúa train station in Erandio , Biscay . He was the son of Telmo Zarraonandía , an engineer and head of Asúa station , and Tomasa Montoya . Zarra was the seventh of ten children , five of them boys . When he was young , Zarra used to play football with his neighbours . While other children had homemade or improvised balls , Zarra had access to a real ball , as two of his brothers played football in La Liga with Arenas de Getxo : Tomás , a goalkeeper and the oldest sibling , and Domingo , who died during the Spanish Civil War . His father did not like Zarra playing football , because \" it was enough with two brothers in the practice of this game . \" But Zarra liked the sport and began playing for several local teams , including Asia and Pitoberese . At that time , he was nicknamed \" Telmito the fearful \" , as he would play cautiously , being ashamed and self-conscious of his skill . Zarra signed his first professional contract with SD Erandio Club of the Second Division , and was incorporated into team during the 1937–38 season . Later he was recruited to a team from Biscay to play a friendly match against a team assembled from Guipuzcoa , during which Zarra scored seven goals in a 9–0 win . Around this time , Athletic Bilbao was looking for players to rebuild the team , which had been disbanded years before in the chaos caused by the Civil War . The team began recruiting young , promising players from Erandio for their team for the 1940–41 season . Professional stage and early successes Zarra debuted with Athletic Club on 29 September 1940 , in a league match against Valencia CF . The game ended in a 2–2 draw , with Zarraonandía scoring both goals for his team ( including his first league goal , scored 17 minutes into the game ) . During the 1941–42 season Zarra temporarily left Athletic Bilbao to join the army . He was dispatched to Ceuta , and played some friendly matches with the team there . Upon his return to Bilbao , Zarra experienced one of the biggest disappointments of his career while playing in the final of the Copa del Rey against Barcelona . They had reached the end of normal time and neither team had managed to score . During extra time , Zarra had an opportunity to score against rival goalkeeper Miró , but he missed the shot ; consequently , Barça won the match and Cup . The 1942–43 campaign was one of the most important for both Zarra and Athletic Bilbao . Athletic reached the Copa del Rey final after having defeated Atlético Madrid and FC Valencia . There they met Real Madrid and this time , Zarra was able to redeem himself by scoring the only goal in the final , winning the year \\'s cup in addition to the league title . Zarra \\'s first serious injury occurred in the 1943–44 season in a match against Barcelona . He broke his clavicle and was unable to play for a while . Once recovered , Zarra was able to return to the pitch and celebrate with a Copa del Rey title , helping Athletic record a 2–0 win over Valencia . In the 1944–45 season , with Athletic again facing Valencia in the Copa del Rey final , four minutes from time a Valencia player fell to the ground . Zarra made a move to trample the fallen player , as a joke , and he was sent off by the referee . This expulsion was the first and only he suffered throughout his career . Despite this , Athletic took the title that year thanks to a goal by Rafael Iriondo that made the score 3–2 . Zarra experienced the best moments of his career in the 1944–45 season with his first Pichichi Trophy , marking 20 goals scored in 26 matches . He would go on to win this award on five other occasions ( 1946 , 1947 , 1950 , 1951 and 1953 ) . 1945–1953 On 11 March 1945 , Zarra was selected by the Spanish coach Jacinto Quincoces to join the Spanish national team for a friendly match against Portugal in Lisbon . On 6 May of that year he played against Portugal again , and scored two of the four goals that won the match . On 28 May 1950 , Zarra again played in another Copa del Rey final , this time against Real Valladolid after Valencia CF was disbanded . During the final , he scored four of the goals that won the game for his team . He opened the scoring at 14 minutes , but by end of regulation time the match was drawn . During extra time , Zarra scored a hat trick as Athletic won the cup . With those four against Valladolid , Zarra holds the record for highest number of goals scored in a Cup final . Once qualified , the Spanish team played matches against the United States , Chile , and England in the 1950 FIFA World Cup . He scored one of the goals in a 2–0 win over Chile in the second match . Zarra referred to the third game , against England , as \" the game of the century . \" Zarra \\'s goal past the English goalkeeper Bert Williams won the match and sent Spain through at the expense of England . This goal , perhaps the most famous scored by Zarra , gave the victory to the Spanish team in their first World Cup semi-finals . In the 1950–51 season Zarra was able to score 38 goals in 30 league games , a Spanish record that stood until the 2010–11 season . This record was also achieved by the Mexican Hugo Sánchez , although he scored his 38 goals over the course of 38 matches . During the 1951–52 season Zarra suffered his most serious injury of his career , on 25 November 1951 in a game against Atlético Madrid , when the opposing goalkeeper fell on Zarra \\'s leg . An operation was required for full recovery , which kept him out for the rest of the season . On his return in the 1952–53 season , he played 29 games and scored on 25 occasions , giving a scoring average of 0.86 from both seasons . Last years and retirement On 29 April 1954 , Zarra received a tribute and benefit match in Madrid ( played between two regional selections ) in recognition of his long career in Spanish football . This event was attended by several VIPs from the world of football , including Alfredo Di Stéfano , Antonio Puchades , Estanislao Basora , Piru Gaínza , Eduardo Manchon , and Cesar Lesmes . Zarra was nearing the end of this career and watched as young , promising Athletic players took over his role on the team , including a young player named Eneko Arieta , who would become his successor . Zarra ended his Athletic career at the end of the 1954–55 season . From then on he devoted himself to playing for several teams in the Second Division until his official retirement from the game in 1957 ; however , he continued playing football with the veteran players of Biscay , donating the money collected from these games to charities .

Fans may also use football chants to slight the opposition , and many fans sing songs about their club rivals , even when they are not playing them . Sometimes the chants are spontaneous reactions to events on the pitch . Football chants can be simple , consisting of a few loud shouts or spoken words , but more often they are short lines of lyrics and sometimes longer songs . They are typically performed repetitively , sometimes accompanied by handclapping , but occasionally they may be more elaborate involving musical instruments , props or choreographed routines . They are often adaptations of popular songs , using their tunes as the basis of the chants , but some are original . Football chants are known to have been used by fans from the late 19th century onwards , but developed into the current popular forms in the 1960s . Football chants can be historic , dating back as early as the formation of the club popularly sung down the years and considered the anthems for these clubs . They may also be popular for only a relatively short time , with new chants being constantly created and discarded . The tradition of football chants vary from country to country and team to team , but some chants are common to many clubs and popular internationally . Football chants may be considered one of the last remaining sources of an oral folk song tradition . History Football chants may be considered modern examples of traditional storytelling and folk songs . According to folk singer Martin Carthy , football chants are \" the one surviving embodiment of an organic living folk tradition . \" It is also a unique public expression of collective identity , and football chants may be seen as modern examples of the folk tradition blason populaire where a group vocalise their identity as well as their rivalry against another group . Early chants Football fans \\' vocalisations came in the forms of cries , chants and songs in the 19th century . War cries were known to have been used by football fans from the 1880s onwards , with the earliest recorded in Scotland after the Scottish Cup final of 1887 . The first known song which references football , \" The Dooley Fitba \\' Club \" later known as \" \\'Fitba \\' Crazy \" , was also written in the 1880s by James Curran , although it was intended for the music hall rather than the terrace . It was also recorded in the 1890s that Sheffield United fans had adopted a music hall song , the \" Rowdy Dowdy Boys \" , while Southampton fans sang a \" Yi ! Yi ! Yi ! \" chant based on a war cry . Blackburn Rovers fans were reported to have chanted \" We \\'ve won the cup before – many a time \" before their 1891 FA Cup Final match against Notts County . Composer Sir Edward Elgar wrote a football song in honour of the Wolverhampton Wanderers striker , Billy Malpass , after watching a match in February 1898 between Wolves and Stoke City . However , the anthem he wrote , \" He Banged The Leather For Goal \" , never caught on among fans on the terrace . The oldest football song in the world that is still in use today may be \" On the Ball , City \" , a song believed to have been composed in the 1890s by Albert T Smith , who became a director of Norwich City when the club was founded in 1902 . The song was adopted by fans of the club and it is still sung by Norwich \\'s fans . Such club song may have its origin in the public school system ( Norwich City was formed by a group of schoolteachers ) , while others have links with working-class music hall . Other early football chants still sung today include \" Pompey Chimes \" or \" Play up , Pompey \" sung by Portsmouth fans since the 1920s ( an early form is believed to have been sung at the Fratton Park ground in 1899 , therefore it is arguably older than \" On the Ball , City \" ) , and \" Blaydon Races \" , a Geordie folk song from 1862 , which was adopted by Newcastle United fans in the 1930s . Some of the songs sung at football ground by the 1920s were modified from popular music hall songs , for example \" Kick , Kick , Kick , Kick , Kick it \" from \" Chick , Chick , Chick , Chick , Chicken \" and \" Keep the Forwards Scoring \" from \" Keep the Home Fires Burning \" . Chants that referenced players were also heard on the terrace ; for example , \" Give it to Ballie \" chanted by Swansea fans in reference to a player name Billy Ball who played for the club in 1912-1920 . Football chants in the early years were club-specific and they were generally friendly or jocular in tone . Songs with sectarian overtones , however , had been sung at matches between Rangers and Celtic in the 1920s , which became more overtly confrontational in later decades , raising the possibility that sectarianism may have been the origin of oppositional chanting and singing at football matches . Fans of the early period also had a limited repertoire of chants , which become more varied as singing was encouraged by the use of brass bands before games and the community singing movement that arose in the 1920s ( the tradition of singing \" Abide with Me \" at FA Cup finals started in this period ) . 1960s developments While various elements of football chants were already present in the early period , it was in the 1960s that the nature of football chants started to change and modern football chants emerged to become an integral part of fan culture and experience . The catalyst for the change may be due to a number of factors ; one suggestion is the growth and evolution of youth culture in this period which , together with popular music started being played over the public announcement system at matches instead of brass bands , encouraged fans to start their own singing based on popular tunes . Another suggestion is the mixing of fan cultures from different countries through international football competitions that started to be broadcast internationally – the exposure to intense chanting by South American and Italian fans during the 1962 and 1966 World Cups may have encouraged British fans who were previously more reserved to do the same . They also picked up different type of chants from other countries ; Liverpool fans for example , may have used a Brazilian chant \" Brazil , cha-cha-cha \" from the television broadcast of the 1962 World Cup , and turned it into the \" Li-ver-pool , [ clap , clap , clap ] \" chant . Chants became more extensive in the 1960s , and popular songs became increasingly common as the basis of chants as fans adapted these songs to reflect situations and events relevant to them . Chanting the name of the team , chants for players and managers started to become prevalent . Liverpool supporters , particularly those on the Kop , were known for modifying songs in the early 1960s to suit their own purposes , and this practice quickly spread to fans of other clubs who created their own versions after hearing these chants . Liverpool fans , for example , honoured their player Ian St John with \" When the Saints Go Marching In \" , a song that was also adopted by other clubs . Fans of many clubs now have a large and constantly evolving repertoire of chants in addition to a smaller number of songs closely associated with their club . A more controversial aspect of this period of change was that abusive chants targeted at rival team or fans also became widespread . These may be taunts and insults aimed at the opposition teams or players to unnerve them , or obscene or slanderous chants targeted at individuals . A sampling of English football chants in the late 1970s found these types of chants to be the most numerous . Threats of violence may also be made to their rivals in chants ; although such threats were rarely carried out , fights did occur which , together with increasing level of hooliganism in that period , gave these threats a real edge . Some abuses are racial in nature ; for example , anti-Semitic chants directed at Tottenham Hotspur began in the 1960s , also against the Argentine club Atlanta ( commonly heard in the 1960s but may have begun as early as the 1940s ) , and against Ajax in the 1970s . Racist insults directed at black players began to be heard in the 1970s and 1980s in England and Spain when black players started appearing in their leagues in increasing numbers . Concerns over the abusive nature of some of these chants later led to measures in various countries to control them , for example , the British government made racist and indecent chants an offence in the UK in 1991 . In Italy , the Mancino law had been used to prosecute fans for inciting racism . Despite efforts to stop them , some chants remain an issue around the world , such as the \" Eh puto \" chant used by Mexican fans , and racist chants in many countries . International spread As the sport of football spread to other country , so did its associated fan culture of football chants . Many countries , however , have developed their own tradition of football songs and chants ; for example , most Italian clubs have their own official hymns , often written specially for the club by a prominent singer or composer who is a fan of the club . Many countries also have football chants dating from the early part of the 20th century , and football chants created in different countries may be specific to the local culture . Hand-clapping chants were popular in South American countries such as Brazil before it spread to other countries . Some chants originated from other sports ; for example , the \" two , four , six , eight ! \" chant that was used for sports in the United States from the early 20th century was adopted by football fans in the UK in the 1950s . The \" Olé \" chant from bullfighting is believed to be first used in Brazil for Garrincha in 1958 , and a different version , the \" Olé , Olé , Olé \" chant , was first heard at a league game in Spain in 1982 and became popular in that country , while another version quickly spread around Europe in 1986 and became widely popular around the world . As football fans travel to other countries on away international matches , and international broadcasts of football matches are common , fans from around the world often picked up chants from other clubs and countries , and some chants spread in an organic manner and become popular internationally . An example is the chant based on \" Seven Nation Army \" by The White Stripes — it was first adopted by fans of Belgian Club Brugge KV in 2003 , their chant was then picked by Italian fans , and it was made an unofficial anthem for the Italy national football team in the 2006 FIFA World Cup , following which it spread to other football clubs around the world as well as beyond football into other sports and events . Common types of chants A wide variety of football chants exist , some of the more popular ones may be grouped into the following types : Anthems – These are songs that are closely associated with a club , and are commonly sung by fans to express their collective identity . Unlike other types of chants that are variations of widely-used chants , these songs tend to be unique to a particular club . The best-known example may be \" You \\'ll Never Walk Alone \" sung by Liverpool fans , although it has also been adopted by a few other clubs such as Celtic and Borussia Dortmund . Other notable club anthems include \" Blue Moon \" ( Manchester City ) , \" I \\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles \" ( West Ham ) , \" No one likes us , we do n\\'t care \" ( Millwall ) , \" Stern des Südens \" ( Bayern Munich ) , and \" Cant del Barça \" ( Barcelona ) . Some anthems are written specially for the club , for example \" Marching On Together \" for Leeds United , and more recently \" Hala Madrid y nada más \" for Real Madrid , but many are popular songs that for whatever reason have become identified with the club . Engagement with the team – These chants come in various forms . They may be expression of pride or loyalty in the club or team , or identity as fans of the club . At the simplest , the chants may just be repetitions of the name of the team , often with clapping ( e.g . clap , clap , clap 3× , clap 4× , [ name of club ] ) , or they may identify themselves , e.g . \" We are the [ name for fans or home stand ] \" . These also includes songs commonly sung at the club , such as \" When the [ name of team ] Go Marching In \" . The chants may also praise the team , individual players or managers . Typically popular tunes are used for this type of chants , for example , \" There \\'s only one [ name of player ] \" sung to the tune of \" Guantanamera \" , \" Super [ name of player or team ] \" , or the \" Olé , Olé , Olé \" chant . The chants may give encouragement to the team , for example , \" Come on you [ name of team ] \" , \" Vamos [ name of team ] \" , \" Allez [ name of team ] \" . They may be expression of confidence and optimism , suggesting that their team will win a game , the league , be promoted , or win a major cup tie at venues such as Wembley.There may also be expressions of dissatisfaction , such as criticism of the team when they are performing poorly , or calling for the manager to resign , and occasionally against the owner of the club . Insults , threats or expressions of hatred or mockery directed at the opponents – There are large variations in this type of chants . The chants may target the team ( for example , \" Stand up if you hate [ name of team ] \" , \" You \\'re shit \" ) . Chants may be aimed at individual players or managers , and these can range from the amusing to the offensive or obscene . For example , \" Who Ate All the Pies ? \" may be used against a player considered fat , or racist chants directed at black players . Chants may sometimes reflect players or managers in the news , or they may be made-up accusations directed against them that can be sung in either a humorous or offensive manner . Chants may target fans or home grounds of the opponents ( e.g . \" My garden shed is bigger than this \" or \" Is this a library \" ) , and may also refer to events in their rivals \\' club history , sometimes in highly offensive manner . Fans may also use parodies of their rivals \\' anthems , for example , singing \" sign on , sign on ... you \\'ll never get a job \" to the tune of \" You \\'ll Never Walk Alone \" started at a time when there was high unemployment in Liverpool . Reactions to events that happened on the pitch or off the pitch , these may be in celebration of a goal ( e.g . \" two-nil \" ) or aiming to disrupt , or are expressions of boredom . They may also be comments about the officials such as the referees ( e.g . \" the referee \\'s a wanker \" ) , or the policing . Atmospheric chants – Sounds aimed at creating interest or excitement in the game without any specific message , such as long drawn-out \" oooooh \" and \" arrrrrgh \" , or \" la la la la la ... \" Spoken chants Some chants are spoken , sometimes accompanied by percussion . These chants may simply consist of the name of the team and/or words of encouragement . The chants may also be in a call-and-response format . For example , Chile national football team fans will do a routine whereby one group of fans will chant \" Chi-Chi-Chi \" , and another group will respond \" Le-Le-Le \" . For the Indonesia national football team one group of fans will chant \" In-Do-Ne-Sia \" with an air horn and hand clap in response . \" Garuda Di Dadaku \" is sung by fans when Indonesia plays at home . Popularised at the Sydney Olympics and used by Australian football supporters everywhere is the \" Aussie Aussie Aussie , Oi Oi Oi \" chant between two groups of supporters . It is a derivation of Welsh rugby chant \" Oggy Oggy Oggy \" , which was also adapted by Chelsea supporters in tribute to Peter Osgood . Other examples include the United States \\' \" I believe that we will win ! \" and FC Metalist Kharkiv \\'s \" Putin khuilo ! \" . Some chants consist simply of a loud shout or whoop with a hand clap , sometimes led by a drum beat that gets increasingly faster , such as the Viking Thunder Clap made popular by fans of Iceland . Similar chants have been performed by fans of teams such as Motherwell and Lens , and a version called \" Boom Boom Clap \" has been used by fans of North American clubs such as Seattle Sounders and Toronto since 2008 as well as the American national teams . Fighting chants \" You \\'re Gon na Get Your Fucking Head Kicked In \" , sometimes pluralised to \" You \\'re Gon na Get Your Fucking Heads Kicked In \" , is a football chant originating in England . It is also used as a case study in psychology and sociology . The chant is often used as an intimidatory chant towards the opposing fans rather than as an actual threat of violence , but there have been a number of occasions when it has led to a fight between fans . The chant is sometimes used after the opposition have scored . It is now considered to be a dated chant with little current usage in English football culture despite being in common use in the 1970s and 80s . Chants based on hymns and classical music Several football chants are based on hymns , with \" Cwm Rhondda \" ( also known as \" Guide me , O thou great redeemer \" ) being one of the most popular tunes to copy . Amongst others , it has spawned the song \" You \\'re not singing anymore ! \" , \" We support our local team ! \" , and \" I will never be a Blue ! \" . Various teams have used the \" Glory Glory \" chant ( used by \" Tottenham Hotspur \" , \" Leeds United \" , \" Manchester United \" , etc . ) , to the tune of the \" Battle Hymn of the Republic \" . Hibernian were the first team to popularise the song with the release of a record by Hector Nicol in the 1950s ( \" Glory Glory to the Hibees \" ) . The Stars and Stripes Forever is often sung with the words \" Here we go , here we go , here we go ! \" . There have been various adaptations of \" When The Saints Go Marching In \" ( e.g . by fans of Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur ) , and the tune of Handel \\'s Hallelujah chorus . Many football crowd chants/songs are to the tune of \" La donna è mobile \" from Giuseppe Verdi \\'s opera Rigoletto , for example the chant by Derby County fans in honour of Fabrizio Ravanelli of \" We \\'ve got Fabrizio , you \\'ve got fuck allio \" . Italian tifosi employ various operatic arie , especially those by Giuseppe Verdi , for chants . For Parma \\'s home matches at the Stadio Ennio Tardini , during the entry of the teams in the field , Aida \\'s triumphal march resounds as Verdi is a symbol of the city . Italian Torino fans sing their signature chant Toro alè to the tune of French anthem \" La Marsellaise \" . The anthem theme was first popularized as a chant by A.S . Roma \\'s curva sud after a 3-1 match win against Juventus on 30 January 1977 . The anthem has also been modified by the RC Lens fans . French PSG fans sing a rendition of \" Flower of Scotland \" . Arsenal fans have been singing \" Good old Arsenal \" to the tune of Rule Britannia since the 1970-71 season when they won the double . Chants based on spirituals and folk songs Some chants are based on spirituals . \" We shall not be moved \" and \" He \\'s Got the Whole World in His Hands \" are both used by fans . An example of the latter \\'s use was \" He \\'s got a pineapple on his head \" aimed at Jason Lee due to his distinctive hairstyle . The song was later popularised by the television show Fantasy Football League . Christmas carols have also been used as chants like with the theme of \" O Tannenbaum \" by the likes of Manchester United or Chelsea fans . The tune to the Shaker song \" Simple Gifts \" has spawned many terrace chants including \" Carefree \" , a chant associated with Chelsea , though it was originally Chesterfield fans who adapted this . It was also used for a Tottenham song abusing Sol Campbell after his move to Arsenal in 2001 and was sung by Manchester United fans , in honour of Park Ji-Sung . \" Sloop John B \" has been popular amongst English football fans since the mid-2000s . It was adopted by the supporters of English non-league team F.C . United of Manchester as a club anthem in 2007 . Since then more high-profile teams have followed suit , usually with different lyrics for their own teams , most notably Watford , with Newcastle , Blackpool , Middlesbrough and Hull also adopting the song as their own . It was perhaps most famously sung by Phil Brown , the manager of Hull City FC , shortly after Hull had avoided relegation from the Premiership in 2009 . The tune from the song \\'s chorus is often sung with alternative lyrics , particularly \" He scores when he wants \" , \" You know what you are \" and \" We know what we are \" . Some Rangers fans sing a version expressing Anti-Irish sentiment in the lyrics , with the chorus notably replaced by \" Your famine is over , why do n\\'t you go home ? \" . The Geordie folk song \" Blaydon Races \" is associated with Newcastle United . Other folk songs to have their lyrics altered include \" The John B . Sails \" to \" We Won it 5 Times \" by Liverpool fans , \" She \\'ll Be Coming \\'Round the Mountain \" to \" We \\'ll Be Coming Down the Road \" by the Scotland national team and Liverpool fans , \" My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean \" , \" The Wild Rover \" and \" Camptown Races \" , which is used for \" Two World Wars , One World Cup \" , whilst Birmingham City fans sing \" Keep Right on to the End of the Road \" . The melody of \" Bella ciao \" is often used as a chant by Italian ultras groups of Salernitana , Cosenza Calcio , A.S . Livorno and also outside of Italy like with Aris Thessaloniki , AEK Athens F.C . or Paris Saint-Germain F.C . fans , as well as the Timbers Army of MLS \\' Portland Timbers . The song was also adapted by Brazilian fans during World Cup 2018 to tease and taunt Argentina about their possible exit in the first round , which eventually did not occur , with references to Argentinian players Di María , Mascherano , and Messi ( Brazil and Argentina have a well-known football rivalry ) . Italian tifosi are strongly used to sing mocks based on national , and internationally famous folk tunes , like L\\'uva fogarina , Oh ! Susanna and Alouette . \" The Fields of Athenry \" is a widely used anthem by Irish sports fans , sang particularly at rugby and football matches . The song was adopted and reworked by Liverpool fans as \" The Fields of Anfield Road \" . Chants based on popular music Popular music is the most common source of football chants . In the United Kingdom , music hall songs such as \" My Old Man ( Said Follow the Van ) \" , \" Knees Up Mother Brown \" , \" I \\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles \" , \" I Came , I Saw , I Conga \\'d \" and \" Two Little Boys \" have long been used as the basis of terrace chants . Popular standards such as \" Winter Wonderland \" , Scott Joplin \\'s \" The Entertainer \" , and the 1958 Eurovision entry \" Volare \" are also widely adapted to suit players and managers . The Cuban song \" Guantanamera \" became popularly used as a chant in the UK as a version by The Sandpipers charted soon after the 1966 World Cup , commonly in the form of \" There \\'s only one [ player \\'s name ] \" . The tune \" Tom Hark \" is often played at many stadiums following a goal by the home team and for chants such as \" Thursday Nights , Channel 5 \" , whilst \" Que Sera , Sera ( Whatever Will Be , Will Be ) \" by Doris Day is generally reserved for matches where the venue of the final is Wembley Stadium . The rhythm , rather than the melody , of \" Let \\'s Go ( Pony ) \" by The Routers is widely used for clapping , drumming or banging by fans worldwide . Music of the 1960s influenced terrace chants . \" Ring of Fire \" by Johnny Cash and \" That \\'s Amore \" by Dean Martin have been used by several sets of fans . \" Lola \" by The Kinks , and \" Hi Ho Silver Lining \" by Jeff Beck have been adapted by several clubs - most prolific of these include Aston Villa , Sheffield Wednesday and Wolverhampton Wanderers . \" All You Need Is Love \" , \" Hey Jude \" and \" Yellow Submarine \" by The Beatles are often used . Songs from musicals have become very popular as football chants , such as \" Chim Chim Cher-ee \" from the 1964 musical Mary Poppins . Some early songs became popular as football chants later , for example the Venezuelan song \" Moliendo Café \" popular in early 1960s first became used as a chant in Argentina in the late 1970s , which spread to Italy as \" Dale Cavese \" chants in 2006 and then later to clubs around the world . The emergence of funk and disco in the 1970s also made its mark on the terraces with songs such as \" Go West \" by the Village People and \" Oops Up Side Your Head \" by The Gap Band remaining popular amongst fans . \" Ai n\\'t Nobody \" by Rufus and Chaka Khan has been used by Arsenal fans and others . Music popular in the 1980s and 1990s is also used widely . Chants have been based on \" Just Ca n\\'t Get Enough \" by Depeche Mode , \" Love Will Tear Us Apart \" by Joy Division , \" Pop Goes the World \" by Men Without Hats , the Band Aid song \" Do They Know It \\'s Christmas ? \" , \" Papa \\'s Got a Brand New Pigbag \" by Pigbag and \" This Is How It Feels \" by Inspiral Carpets . Other chants have used tunes from on pop songs include \" Three Lions \" , the official England anthem for Euro \\'96 and Manic Street Preachers song \" If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next \" . More recent releases to have their music appropriated include \" Seven Nation Army \" by The White Stripes , which became highly popular across nations . A number of songs became popular in the 2010s , an example being \" Freed from Desire \" , which is used to celebrate particular players – it was first popularised as \" Will Grigg \\'s on Fire \" , then used for others such as \" Vardy \\'s on Fire \" and \" Grizi \\'s on Fire \" . An Italian disco song \" L\\'estate sta finendo \" became popular among European clubs such as Napoli , Juventus , Porto , Atlético Madrid and others as \" Un giorno all\\'improvviso \" , later picked up Liverpool fans , who created their own version as \" Allez Allez Allez \" for their 2017–18 UEFA Champions League campaign , and it then spread to other British clubs in the 2018–2019 season . In late 2017 , \" September \" by Earth , Wind & Fire had a big impact in English stadia . Chants based on advertising jingles , nursery rhymes and theme tunes Football crowds also adapt tunes such as advertising jingles , nursery rhymes and theme tunes . \" The Farmer in the Dell \" known in some regions as \\'The Farmer Wants A Wife \\' , provides the famous chant of \" Ee Aye Addio \" , a tune which also provides the first bars of the 1946 be-bop jazz classic \" Now \\'s The Time \" , by alto saxophonist Charlie Parker . The marching tune \" When Johnny Comes Marching Home \" is also used a basis for songs , such as \" His Armband Said He Was a Red \" , sung by Liverpool fans in honour of Fernando Torres while he was still at the club . Chelsea fans then adapted the chant to match their own colours when Torres was transferred to the London club in 2011 , with \" He \\'s now a Blue , he was a Red . \" Manchester United used the song to describe Torres and his looks too after he missed an open goal . United also used the song about John O\\'Shea after he scored a goal against Derby in the Carling Cup in 2009 . The children \\'s song \" Ten Green Bottles \" became \" Ten German Bombers \" , to the tune of \" She \\'ll Be Coming \\'Round the Mountain , \" both songs used by English fans to their main rivals , Germany . The nursery rhyme \" This Old Man \" is sung by both supporters of Manchester United and Manchester City . The theme from Z-Cars has been used in Everton \\'s Goodison Park ground since 1962 . Theme tunes which have been used as chants include Heartbeat and The Banana Splits . Club-specific songs Some football teams also have songs which are traditionally sung by their fans . The song \" You \\'ll Never Walk Alone \" from Carousel is associated heavily with Liverpool . In 1963 , the song was covered by Liverpool group Gerry and the Pacemakers , which prompted the song \\'s adoption by the Kop . At this time , supporters standing on the Spion Kop terrace at Anfield began singing popular chart songs of the day . The mood was captured on camera by a BBC Panorama camera crew in 1964 . One year later , when Liverpool faced Leeds in the FA Cup final , the travelling Kop sang the same song and match commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme commended the \" Liverpool signature tune \" . Fans of West Ham United were said to have adopted the song \" I \\'m Forever Blowing Bubbles \" at Upton Park in the mid-1920s , although no record of West Ham fans singing the song existed until 1940 . \" Marching on Together \" is played and sung at Elland Road by supporters of Leeds United , and is one of the few club songs specifically written for the football club in question , being an original composition by Les Reed and Barry Mason . It was first released as the B-Side to Leeds United to coincide with the 1972 FA Cup Final . Manchester City has been strongly associated with the classic popular song \" Blue Moon \" since the late 1980s . The song is now an established and official part of the club \\'s brand and culture : \\'Blue Moon \\' is also the name of the club \\'s leading fansite , images of a blue moon ( a moon that \\'s blue in colour , not the astronomical phenomenon ) appear on licensed and fan-made clothing and merchandise , and the team \\'s mascots are a pair of blue aliens from the moon named \\'Moonchester \\' and \\'Moonbeam \\' . \" Go West \" by the Village People has been co-opted by fans of Arsenal F.C. , using the words \" 1-0 to the Arsenal \" as a reference to the club \\'s defensive style of football under former manager George Graham . The same \" 1-0 to the Arsenal \" was also often sung , in ironic spirit , by fans of opposition by way of mocking their perceived boring style of play during this time .. The tune is also used by supporters of Leyton Orient with the words \" Stand Up for The Orient \" \" Sailing \" ( originally by the Sutherland Brothers , but most commonly associated with Rod Stewart ) is sung by Chesterfield fans , usually whenever the Spireites look to be \\'sailing \\' to victory . A much faster-tempo version of the melody is used by Millwall F.C . fans for their famous chant \" No one likes us , we do n\\'t care \" . Birmingham City adopted \" Keep Right on to the End of the Road \" by Sir Harry Lauder after the team sang it on the coach before the 1956 FA Cup Final Versus Manchester City , it was heard by the fans outside Wembley Stadium . The song was a favourite of Alex Govan who introduced to his teammates , and their manager Arthur Turner used the song as a pre-match ritual in their FA Cup run . It has been the Blues Anthem ever since . Supporters of Hibernian are known for singing \" Sunshine on Leith \" due to the song \\'s composers and performers The Proclaimers being well known Hibernian supporters and the song \\'s reference to Hibernian \\'s home in Leith and as such the song has become an unofficial club anthem . The club has in the past also played other songs by the pair at its home ground Easter Road , such as \" I \\'m on My Way \" , though none have the same association with the team that \" Sunshine on Leith \" does . Fans of Tottenham Hotspur sing Barry Manilow \\'s \" Ca n\\'t Smile Without You \" . Brighton & Hove Albion play \" Good Old Sussex by the Sea \" before each home game at Falmer Stadium , a tradition continued from their time at the \" Goldstone Ground . \" Stoke City fans have sung \" Delilah \" by Tom Jones since the 1980s . Supporters of Sheffield Wednesday regularly sing the words \" Honolulu Wednesday \" to the tune of \" Honolulu Baby \" ; a song which featured in the 1933 film Sons of the Desert starring Laurel and Hardy . Across the city , Sheffield United F.C . fans celebrate the start of home games with a chorus of The Greasy Chip Butty Song . Before every match , Nottingham Forest fans sing \" Mull of Kintyre \" , replacing \" Mull of Kintyre \" with \" City Ground \" , and \" Mist rolling in from the sea \" with \" Mist rolling in from the Trent \" . \" Mull of Kintyre \" has also been adopted by Charlton Athletic , with Valley , Floyd Road and the Thames similarly being referenced . \" Ca n\\'t Help Falling in Love \" has been adopted originally by Sunderland as well as several other teams including Huddersfield Town , Hull City , Preston North End , Rotherham United , Swindon Town , Swansea , AFC Wimbledon , and Columbus Crew . The Dave Clarke Five \\'s \" Glad All Over \" has been sung since the 1960s by Crystal Palace and is also used by several clubs after a home goal is scored , including Swindon Town . Gateshead supporters sing \" Trail of the Lonesome Pine \" from the film Way Out West . Sydney FC supporter group \" The Cove \" sing \" Rhythm of My Heart \" by Rod Stewart in the 23rd minute of every game as tribute to supporters who have died .

Chant Laureate On 11 May 2004 , Jonny Hurst was chosen as England \\'s first \" Chant Laureate \" . Barclaycard set up the competition to choose a Chant Laureate , to be paid £10,000 to tour Premier League stadia and compose chants for the 2004–05 football season . The judging panel was chaired by the Poet Laureate Andrew Motion , who said \" What we felt we were tapping into was a huge reservoir of folk poetry . \" Argentine fútbol chanting Eduardo Herrera suggests that soccer chanting in Argentina allows participants to create value around and give meaning to the idea of “ aguante , ” which is “ central in the construction of an ideal masculinity . ” “ Aguante ” translates to “ endurance ” or “ stamina ” in English . In practice , aguante is part of a masculine discourse that “ divides the world between ‘ real men ’ and ‘ not men . ’ Garriga Zucal and Daniel Salerno have identified three main signs of aguante . The first is “ alentar siempre , ” which means to show support for the team throughout the entire match by jumping or chanting , even through bad weather or poor performance by the team . Secondly , to show aguante , a man must show up to all the matches , including away games that require long , uncomfortable trips . Thirdly , a fan must withstand confrontation to demonstrate aguante , either through chanting at opposing fans or through physical fights . Participating in chanting or cantitos is a major way the barras bravas , or the most important militant groups of fans , can demonstrate aguante . The barras bravas , who are also known as the hinchada militante , stand throughout the game behind the goal and chant the entire time . These groups bring instruments to the matches in order to synchronize the chanting . The most prominent instrument is the bombo con platillo , which is a large bass drum with a diameter of 22-24 inches . The bombos con platillo are often decorated with the team \\'s colors and name and the name of the barra group , which is distinct from the team name . Along with these drums , other types of drums include Brazilian surdo drums , redoblantes ( snare drums ) , and repiques . The barras often have other percussion instruments , including scrappers , tambourines , cowbells , and agogo bells . In addition to percussion , most barras have at least three trumpet players , and many teams might add trombones or euphoniums . While the bombo players are always from the barras bravas itself , because of the advanced skill it takes to play the brass instruments , the barras sometimes hire outside brass players to play during a match . In the ensemble , one bombo player serves as the leader of the group , where he leads with exaggerated arm movements that are easy for the players to follow , but the leader of the chanting is often falls to another leader of the barras . They might lead by giving verbal or visual cues to the head bombo player , or they might just independently start a chant and expect the ensemble to follow .

The city is located northwest of Buenos Aires , on the west bank of the Paraná River . Rosario is the third-most populous city in the country , and is also the most populous city in Argentina that is not a capital ( provincial or national ) . With a growing and important metropolitan area , Greater Rosario has an estimated population of 1,750,000 . One of its main attractions includes the neoclassical , Art Nouveau , and Art Deco architecture that has been retained over the centuries in hundreds of residences , houses and public buildings . Rosario is the head city of the Rosario Department and is located at the heart of the major industrial corridor in Argentina . The city is a major railroad terminal and the shipping center for north-eastern Argentina . Ships reach the city via the Paraná River , which allows the existence of a port . The Port of Rosario is subject to silting and must be dredged periodically . Exports include wheat , flour , hay , linseed and other vegetable oils , corn , sugar , lumber , meat , hides , and wool . Manufactured goods include flour , sugar , meat products , and other foodstuffs . The Rosario-Victoria Bridge , opened in 2004 , spans the Paraná River , connecting Rosario with the city of Victoria , across the Paraná Delta . The city plays a critical role in agricultural commerce , and thus finds itself at the center of a continuing debate over taxes levied on big-ticket agricultural goods such as soy . Along with Paraná , Rosario is one of the few Argentine cities that can not point to a particular individual as its founder . The city \\'s patron is the \" Virgin of the Rosary \" , whose feast day is October 7 . History Early settlement Even though the city did not have a clear foundation date or any official acknowledgement thereof , most commentators state that Rosario was founded on 7 October 1793 with a local population of 457 inhabitants . Nonetheless , the town was officially declared a city on 3 August 1852 , at the time it was known as Pago de los Arroyos , that is , \" land of the streams \" , a reference to the several small rivers that traverse the southern region of Santa Fe , like the Ludueña Stream , the Saladillo Stream and others , emptying into the Paraná River . In 1689 , captain Luís Romero de Piñeda received part of the lands of the Pago de los Arroyos by royal decree , as payment for services to the Spanish Crown . Before that , the area was originally inhabited by various indigenous tribes , some of which lived in reducciones , a type of missions founded by Franciscans . These missions were ultimately attacked and destroyed by hostile tribes of the Chaco region . Romero de Piñeda established the first permanent settlement , an estancia — intended as farmland , not as a town . In 1719 , the Jesuits bought another part and established Estancia San Miguel . The area was still so scarcely populated that it had no central authority ; it was ruled from the provincial capital ( Santa Fe ) , and in turn from Buenos Aires . In 1724 , another colonial settlement was initiated by Santiago de Montenegro , who set up a mill , drew plans for the future town , built a chapel , and was appointed mayor in 1751 . The area of control of this local government extended northward from today \\'s Rosario ; only in 1784 was it divided into two smaller jurisdictions . On February 27 , 1812 , General Manuel Belgrano raised the newly created Argentine flag on the shores of the Paraná , for the first time . Because of this , Rosario is known as the \" Cradle of the Argentine Flag \" . The National Flag Memorial marks the occasion . 19th century The province of Santa Fe suffered greatly from the civil war that afflicted Argentina after 1820 . Demographic growth was relatively slow . During this period , Rosario was a small settlement and a stop on the way from the city of Santa Fe to Buenos Aires . In 1823 , it was elevated to the category of \" village \" ( Ilustre y Fiel Villa del Rosario ) . Charles Darwin travelled through the area in 1832 and described Rosario as \" a large town \" with about 2,000 residents . In 1841 , a decree of the caudillo and Governor of Buenos Aires , Juan Manuel de Rosas , banned navigation of the Paraná and Paraguay rivers to non-Argentine vessels , and thus shut off the Port of Rosario to foreign trade . On 25 December 1851 , a small group of locals and the military guard of the city declared their support for the rival caudillo Justo José de Urquiza . As a reward for their participation in the Battle of Caseros , triumphant Urquiza wrote to the governor of Santa Fe on 9 June 1852 asking for Rosario to be granted city status . Governor Domingo Crespo justified the request at the provincial legislative body , marking the geographically strategic position of the town for national and international trade , and on 5 August , Rosario was formally declared a city . Urquiza opened up the river for free international trade . The city \\'s economy and population expanded at an accelerated rate . By 1880 , Rosario had become the first export outlet of Argentina . During the last 15 years of the 19th century , the city more than doubled its population , in part due to immigration . By 1887 it had about 50,000 inhabitants , of whom 40 % were European immigrants , who brought new ideas from Europe and began to turn Rosario into a politically progressive city ( contrasting with the more conservative , aristocratic Santa Fe ) . During the second half of the 19th century , there was a movement promoting that the city of Rosario become the capital of the republic . Ovidio Lagos , founder of the oldest Argentine newspaper , La Capital , was one of the strongest proponents of this idea ( one of the main avenues in Rosario now carries his name ) . Rosario was indeed declared the federal capital on three occasions , but each time the law was vetoed by the Executive Branch ( once by Bartolomé Mitre and twice by Domingo Faustino Sarmiento ) . In 1911 , the French-owned railway company Ferrocarril Rosario y Puerto Belgrano opened a line between Rosario and Puerto Belgrano , Argentina \\'s main naval base . By 1926 , Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants , 47 % of them foreign , many coming from Europe in the wake of World War I . Contemporary history In 1969 , workers and students took to the streets and organized strikes in what has been dubbed the \" Rosariazo \" against the dictatorship . A few years later , in 1976 , the military dictatorship made hundreds of dissident citizens \" disappear \" in what is known as the Dirty War . In 1983 , Argentina returned to democratic rule , but in 1989 , hyperinflation caused the economic collapse of the country . In Rosario there were riots and looting episodes . Under the Menem administration , the situation worsened as the industrial sector of the city was dismantled by foreign competition , and agricultural exports stagnated . In 1995 , unemployment in the area reached 21.1 % and a large part of Rosario \\'s population fell below the poverty line . Since the recovery of the national economy that followed the 2001 collapse , Rosario \\'s economic situation has improved . The boom in agricultural exports has caused a large increase in consumer spending and investment . The Socialist Party has won mayoral races in the city in every election since Councilman Héctor Cavallero \\'s 1989 election . Cavallero \\'s successor , Hermes Binner ( elected in 1995 ) , was elected Governor of Santa Fe in 2007 and became the runner-up in the 2011 presidential election on the FAP ticket . Mayor Miguel Lifschitz \\'s administration , elected in 2007 , took advantage of the economic boom to invest heavily in public works as well as in public health ( which takes up about a quarter of the whole budget ) . Mayor Mónica Fein became , in 2011 , the first Socialist woman elected mayor in Argentine history . After the 1990s , Rosario became a major city of the illegal drug trade in Argentina , headed by a drug gang called \" Los Monos \" ( \" The Monkeys \" ) . Early during 2018 , it was estimated by national news sources that a turf war between local drug gangs ( \" Los Funes \" and \" Los Camino \" ) was costing an average of one life every twenty five hours . Government Rosario is ruled by an executive branch represented by a mayor ( seat : Palacio de los Leones ) , and a legislative branch , consisting of a Deliberative Council ( seat : Palacio Vassallo ) . The mayor is elected for a four-year term , and the Council renews half of its 21 members every two years . Municipal Centre District ( CMD ) Since 1997 , a municipal program of decentralization of legislative activities was carried out , materialized in 6 Municipal Centres of District ( Centre , North , South , West , Northwest and Southwest ) . The city is divided into six large administrative districts ( Center , North , Northwest , West , Southwest , and South ) , with Municipal District Centers that provide services to the population . For years , local people and institutions have been pushing the provincial government to grant Rosario the status of Autonomous City . Some , with the sponsorship of the governors of Santa Fe , Entre Ríos and Córdoba as well as other important politicians , have put forward a legislative project to move the National Congress to Rosario , to decentralize the national government . Since the return to democracy in 1983 , the mayors of Rosario were Horacio Usandizaga , Héctor Cavallero ( standing in for Usandizaga , then re-elected ) , Hermes Binner ( re-elected once ) , Miguel Lifschitz ( re-elected once ) , and , since December 2011 to December 2019 , Mónica Fein . Currently , the mayor is Pablo Javkin , whose term lasts from December 2019 to 2023 . From Cavallero on ( 1989 ) , the mayor has been a member of the Socialist Party , since December 2019 , Rosario \\'s mayor is from a different political party , ending more than 30 years of socialism . The city does not have a police force of its own ( it is served by the provincial police ) , but in 2004 it pioneered the creation of a special patrol force of unarmed officers called Guardia Urbana Municipal ( \" Municipal Urban Guard \" ) , which was later used as a model for Buenos Aires and other cities . Municipal statistics The municipality of Rosario comprises , of which are urbanized , in 6,306 housing blocks . Of this area , , 5.3 % is devoted to green spaces ( parks , boulevards , plazas ) , which gives over 10 m2 of green space per inhabitant . Electric power is supplied to the whole urban area and running water reaches 97 % of the population ( about 350,000 homes ) . Natural gas is provided to 227,152 homes . With the recovery of the national economy since 2002 , the city experienced a real-estate boom . In the period 2003–2006 , the construction sector added 2 million m2 , investing about $ 900 million . Despite this increased supply , both price and rent have increased sharply compared to the values during the 1990s . According to experts , this growth was propelled by the increased purchasing power of farmers around Rosario , helped by competitive exports , and the overall preference for safer investment options . Health Rosario has several public health centers : five municipal hospitals ( including a children \\'s hospital and an emergency hospital/trauma center ) and a municipal outpatient-only center , plus two large provincial hospitals ( Hospital Provincial and Hospital Centenario ) , and their associated primary care centers in the city proper and its metropolitan area . Economy Rosario is the centre of a metropolitan region whose economy is based on services and industry , generating the second-largest urban gross regional product of Argentina , after Greater Buenos Aires . The principal manufacturing sector is the agro industry , whose industries are placed in the northern and southern areas of Greater Rosario ; the investments over the last decade have transformed Rosario into a major role of processing oil of the world Many other sectors contribute to the diversified industrial offerings of the city . Rosario and its metropolitan area produce 20 % of the cars , 4 % of the domestic refrigerators , 80 % of the machinery for the food industry and 100 % of the auto bodies for long-distance buses made in Argentina . Other important sectors include the petrochemical sector , with three plants located in the suburbs of San Lorenzo and Port San Martin ; the chemistry sector , with plants for sulphuric acid , fertilizers , resins and other products ; the cellulose industry ; the meat industry ; ironworks ; auto parts ; the plants and equipment for bottled oil ; agricultural machinery ; and the materials and equipment for the construction industry . Worldwide international companies settled in Rosario include , among others , General Motors , Cargill , Unilever , John Deere , Petrobrás , ICI , Dow , Tenneco and Mahle . The main financial bank at the city of Rosario is the Municipal Bank of Rosario . Its central offices are located in the financial district , on San Martín St. , and there are several additional offices throughout the city . It is focused on small and medium enterprises and other organizations , especially through micro credits , and may be considered an \" ethical bank . \" The Municipal Bank was founded in 1896 to support the financial needs of the citizens and small businesses in the highly productive region of southern Santa Fe Province , centered in Rosario . At the time , the city had around 92,000 inhabitants and was already the most important port on the Paraná River . The idea of creating a municipal financial institution was expressed in 1893 by Mayor Floduardo Grandoli , citing the proliferation of \" centers of usury \" that exploited those in need of credit , especially the poor ( something not addressed by the profile of the Provincial Bank of Santa Fe , which granted loans only to demonstrably solvent persons ) . Acting on this , the municipal Counseling Commission passed a bill ( on 1 February 1895 ) dictating an \" Organic Charter of the Municipal Bank of Loans and Savings Accounts ; \" the bank opened exactly one year later . The seat of the bank was moved in 1905 . Its name was changed to its present form on 14 May 1940 by a municipal bill . Its location was moved again , for the last time so far , in 1986 . Following some political controversy , the bank in 2006 was capitalized by the municipality to comply with new regulations dictated by the Central Bank , and transformed into a joint stock company , with only 1 % of the stock belonging to the municipal state . A special clause was added , dictating that this minimum share is unchangeable , to prevent hypothetical attempts at privatization . The Rosario Board of Trade hosts the country \\'s largest commodity market , dealing in cereals and oilseeds , and also the largest futures exchange ( ROFEX ) . The banking sector includes the state-owned Municipal Bank of Rosario , with branches and offices throughout the city , and the central branch of the New Bank of Santa Fe . The largest technological center in Argentina – Polo Tecnológico Rosario ( PTR ) – is located in Rosario within La Siberia site . The center focuses mainly on research and development of the three following areas : biotechnology , software development , and telecommunications . It currently employs 3,500 people , and it is expected to grow 100 % by 2015 to become one of the largest in Latin America . Culture Rosario has many cultural activities in many artistic disciplines with national and international reach . The city has produced important personalities in the fields of music , painting , philosophy , politics , poetry , literature , medicine , and law . Among the city \\'s important theaters are El Círculo , Sala Lavardén , Broadway , Astengo Auditorium , and La Comedia . A cultural complex known as Puerto de la Música , designed by the modernist architect Oscar Niemeyer ( of Brasilia fame ) , is to be built along the banks of the Paraná River . If completed , it will be one of the largest centers for musical performance in Latin America . In 2012 , after years without progress , it was put on indefinite hold due to financial constraints . January 1995 saw the launch of the Rosario District Fishing Championship , held in the Parana River . Three years later , in 1998 , a 10-year-old Lionel Messi was crowned Junior Champion . The city has several museums , including Juan B . Castagnino Fine Arts Museum , Firma y Odilo Estévez Municipal Decorative Art Museum , Dr . Julio Marc Provincial Historical Museum , City Museum , and Museum of Contemporary Art of Rosario ( MACRo ) . The Dr . Ángel Gallardo Provincial Natural Sciences Museum was rebuilt after a fire in 2003 and re-opened at a new location in 2006 . Rosario also has a public astronomy complex , located in Urquiza Park , which consists of an observatory ( inaugurated in 1970 ) and a planetarium ( 1984 ) . The Fundación Italia is a cultural institution created in 1985 as a \" cultural bond with Italy \" . It has organized a Neapolitan music concert , performances of Madame Butterfly and numerous talks about the present and future of Argentina . Among the people invited to give these talks were economists Domingo Cavallo and Alfonso Prat Gay , renowned scholars Beatriz Sarlo and Silvia Bleichmar , journalists Alejandro Rozitchner and Jorge Asís , filmmaker Fernando Solanas and former presidents of Chile ( Ricardo Lagos ) , Argentina ( Eduardo Duhalde ) , and Uruguay ( Luis Alberto Lacalle Herrera ) .

Juan Álvarez Biblioteca Central General José de San Martín Biblioteca Municipal Francisco López Merino Biblioteca de la Legislatura de la Provincia Landmarks National Flag Memorial The National Flag Memorial in Rosario is a monumental complex built near the banks of the Paraná River . It was commissioned in 1944 and inaugurated on June 20 , 1957 – the anniversary of the death of Manuel Belgrano , creator of the Argentine flag , who raised it for the first time on an island in the river on February 27 , 1812 . The complex has a total area of about and was constructed using stone primarily sourced in the Andes . The structure was designed by the architects Ángel Guido and Alejandro Bustillo , and the monument was adorned with works by sculptors Lola Mora , Eduardo Barnes , Alfredo Bigatti , and José Fioravanti . The Memorial ( Monumento ) has three parts : the Tower ( Torre ) or mast , high , which commemorates the Revolution of May 1810 and houses Manuel Belgrano \\'s crypt in its base ; the Civic Courtyard ( Patio Cívico ) , which symbolizes the effort of the organization of the state ( the Courtyard is used for massive open-air shows ) , and the Triumphal Propylaeum ( Propileo Triunfal ) , representing the nation as organized after the 1853 Constitution . Under the Propylaeum there is the Honor Room for the Flags of America ( where the flags of all American nations are displayed ) . The complex faces Belgrano Avenue , and is delimited by Córdoba and Santa Fe Streets , the latter of which slopes down towards the river at this point . The Propylaeum can be accessed from the pedestrian passage called Pasaje Juramento ( \" Oath Passage \" ) , which starts at Buenos Aires St . between the municipal building ( Palacio de los Leones ) and the Cathedral , in front of Plaza 25 de Mayo ( May 25 Square ) . Statues flank the passage by famous sculptor Lola Mora . The Memorial and the National Flag Park located in front of it are the seat of the main celebrations of Flag Day on June 20 . The 50th anniversary of the inauguration of the complex , in 2007 , was marked by a special celebration and by the unveiling of a new lighting system . El Puerto de la Música will be a theater with a total capacity of 30,000 people located by the Paraná River . Architect Oscar Niemeyer came up with the concept by expanding the show from inside the theater to a much larger outside audience . The concrete curvilinear shape building with an area of is the first design of Oscar Niemeyer in Argentina . The project will be a distinctive part of Rosario \\'s skyline . Construction will begin at the end of 2010 and is expected to be completed by 2014 . Planetarium Located in Urquiza Park , Rosario \\'s Municipal Astronomical Complex is one of the principal astronomical centers of the region . The planetarium has a core team , together with its secondary elements , providing an artificial image of the sky through projections made on a fixed hemispherical dome that functions as a display . The assembly is installed in the Room \" Oscar Claudio Caprile \" , located in the heart of the magnificent building that is shaped like a comet . For its technical characteristics in terms of size , quality of sound and image , and interior comfort , this room is considered among the best in the world . The building in the shape of a comet forms a part of the complex that includes the \" Prof . Victor Capolongo \" observatory and the experimental science museum . The observatory Municipal Astronomical Observatory \" Prof . Victor Capolongo \" was inaugurated on June 18 , 1970 , and named its first director . The Observatory facilitates outreach , teaching , and research in the field of astronomy and related sciences and informs the public of phenomena that occur in the sky , such as eclipses , planetary configurations , passages of comets , etc . To that end , the Observatory has installed two telescopes . One Coudé refractor has a aperture and focal distance provided with Lyot \\'s monochromatic filter for solar observation . Another Cassegrain reflector has aperture , constructed by the Carl Zeiss company . There are realized observations and astronomical photography of all the visible celestial objects in Rosario \\'s sky , according to time of year and especially the Sun , the Moon , and the planets Jupiter , Saturn , Mars , and Venus . The asteroid 14812 Rosario was named in the city \\'s honor as a result . Experimental Science Museum This museum was inaugurated on September 24 , 1987 . It is the first in Argentina and differs from traditional museums , in that it has equipment and instruments to demonstrate the laws of nature , which can be interactively used by the general public . Thus , visitors of all ages can use telescopes and microscopes or experiment with lasers , sound mixers , radios of various types , computers , solar cells , etc . To complement this , exhibit panels have photographs and explanatory texts of science and technology : mathematics and computer science , engineering , physics , astronomy , astronautics , geology , chemistry , and biology . In addition , an important area is intended for periodic samples , such as the Space Age , energy : renewable and rational use , from sand to glass , among others . The museum staff is supported by contributions from the Ministry of Science and Technology Office , the Municipality of Rosario , and the contributions made by institutions and individuals . The museum audiovisual projections are made in the Video Sector Science , which has an area called \" CIENCIANIÑO \" ( ChildScience ) for children aged 4 to 10 . The museum works in the evening , similar to the Planetarium . Educational institutions at all levels are treated in shift assignments . Statue of Che Guevara The 4-metre-tall bronze statue of Che Guevara was unveiled on 14 June 2008 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of his birth . It is made from 75,000 bronze keys donated by Argentines nationwide and weighs 2.7 tons . The statue was made by artist Andrés Zerneri and is the first such monument to Guevara in his native Argentina . Demographics Demographic distribution Rosario is located in the Province of Santa Fe , Argentina . This metropolis has a population of about 1.2 million ( 1,159,004 est . ) , thus being Argentina \\'s third most populated urban settlement , after Córdoba . Greater Rosario comprises Rosario itself ( population about 910,000 ) and a large area around it , spreading in all directions except eastward ( because of the Paraná River ) . Directly to the south , it includes the city of Villa Gobernador Gálvez , with a population of about 75,000 , about from Rosario city center . To the west and south-west there are several smaller towns and cities ( Funes , Roldán , Pérez , Soldini ) ; Roldán is from the Rosario city centre . These settlements were incorporated into the metropolis due to their vicinity to major roads leading into Rosario , and many people living there habitually commute to Rosario . The farthest end is to the north , following the coast of the river ; from Rosario , one finds , in succession and usually merging into each other , the towns of Granadero Baigorria , Capitán Bermúdez , Fray Luis Beltrán , San Lorenzo ( already in a different departamento , with a population of over 40,000 ) , and Puerto General San Martín , the last being at a distance of from Rosario . The north of the Greater Rosario is one end of an area traditionally called Cordón Industrial ( \" Industrial Corridor \" ) , since it was traditionally a heavily industrialized productive region . The prelude to the economic crisis in the 1990s largely dismantled the industrial infrastructure and damaged agricultural exports . These sectors were largely revitalized by 2006 as the national economy continued to recover , but high levels of poverty and unemployment persist in the city \\'s western neighborhoods ( official surveys indicated that in 2011 , 6.5 % of the metro area population was under the poverty line ; and that in 2012 , 8.3 % of the labor force was unemployed ) . In 1876 the total population was 203,509 ; by 1926 , Rosario had 407,000 inhabitants , 47 % of them foreign , many having arrived from Europe in the wake of World War I . Most of these were Italian , and among them , a majority from the north-western region of Liguria . As of the 2010 Census , there were 1,193,605 people residing in the city and 31 surrounding districts , making Greater Rosario the third-largest metro area in Argentina even as its population growth has leveled off . The population density in Rosario proper was 6,680 inhabitants per square kilometer ( 17,300 per mi2 ) ; but , only about 2,400 per km2 ( 6,100 per mi2 ) in the suburbs . The 2010 Census also showed a relatively aged population . With 21 % under the age of fifteen and 17 % over sixty , the people have an age structure similar to those in many North American cities . They are , likewise , more elderly on average than Argentines as a whole ( of whom 25 % were under 15 and 14 % , over 60 ) . The ethnic make-up of Rosario changed in the late 19th century , when significant numbers of European immigrants arrived in the city . Prior to this the city \\'s population had been almost completely European-descent in ethnic origin . As Buenos Aires was the first landfall in Argentina for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1850s and 1890s , Rosario started to experience a diverse influx of people . The main contributors were Spain , Italy , France , Croatia , Poland , Russia , Romania , Ukraine , the Balkans ( especially Greece , Serbia and Montenegro ) , Switzerland , Germany , United Kingdom , Ireland , and Scandinavia ( especially Sweden ) . By the 1910s , 43 percent of the city population was non-native Argentine after immigration rates peaked . Most immigrants , regardless of origin , settled in the city or around Greater Rosario . However , in the first stages of immigration , some formed colonies ( especially agricultural colonies ) in different parts of the city , often encouraged by the Argentine government and/or sponsored by private individuals and organizations . Christianity is the dominant faith with Roman Catholicism as the most practiced , followed by Protestantism . Judaism is the second-most professed religion in the city as Rosario has one of the largest Jewish communities in Argentina . There is also a local Islamic society . Districts Rosario is divided into six districts , most named by location , although the easternmost is called Centre District for it includes the oldest part of the city , historically called Centro ( City Centre ) . The data given below are from the . Centre District Population : 261,047 Area : 20.37 km2 ( 11.45 % of the city ) Population density : 12,815 inhab/km2 Housing : 110,152 units North District Population : 131,495 Area : 35.02 km2 ( 19.6 % of the city ) Population density : 3,744 inhab/km2 Housing : 40,492 units Northwest District Population : 144,461 Area : 44.14 km2 ( 24.7 % of the city ) Population density : 3,273 inhab/km2 Housing : 41,740 units West District Population : 106,356 Area : 40.21 km2 ( 22.5 % of the city ) Population density : 2,645 inhab/km2 Housing : 31,625 units Southwest District Population : 103,446 Area : 20.19 km2 ( 11.3 % of the city ) Population density : 5,123 inhab/km2 Housing : 28,284 units South District Population : 160,771 Area : 18.76 km2 ( 10.5 % of the city ) Population density : 8,569 inhab/km2 Housing : 48,541 units Urban structure Centre District At Rosario city center , Córdoba Street is the main avenue . It begins at the Flag Memorial Park , climbs towards the district area , and becomes a pedestrian walk for seven blocks , between Plaza 25 de Mayo and Plaza Pringles . Along Córdoba Ave to the west Paseo del Siglo ( \" Walk of the Century \" ) was settled , with former houses of wealthy families , finally there is also the San Martín Square , and elsewhere , Plaza Montenegro ( on Peatonal San Martín , the pedestrian-only four blocks of San Martín Street ) and Plaza Sarmiento . Oroño Boulevard ( going north–south ) and Pellegrini Avenue ( east-west ) mark the boundaries of the town center together with the river . At their confluence starts the Parque de la Independencia , that houses the Juan B . Castagnino Fine Arts Museum , the Newell \\'s Old Boys football club , and the sports clubs Provincial and Gimnasia y Esgrima , as well as the horse racetrack and the former Sociedad Rural ( Rural Society ) . Towards the south , beyond Pellegrini Avenue , there are two more boulevards , 27 de Febrero and Seguí , and avenues Uriburu , Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez . To the west , after Oroño , there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia , Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue . The main barrios in the south are La Tablada , Parque Casado , Las Heras , Las Delicias and Las Flores . The city ends in the Saladillo Stream . Among the districts in the west are Echesortu , Belgrano , Triángulo , Moderno , Godoy and Fisherton . To the north-east there lie Pichincha , Ludueña , Lisandro de la Torre ( home of Rosario Central \\'s stadium ) and Empalme Graneros . Next to the stadium , there is the Parque Alem , and nearby the Sorrento thermal power plant . To the north lie the districts of Alberdi , La Florida ( with a popular beach resort of the same name ) , Parque Field ( built under US President John F . Kennedy \\'s Alliance for Progress development plans ) and Rucci . The main streets are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation , Rondeau Boulevard ( which leads to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge and the city of Granadero Baigorria ) . These are crossed by the avenues Las Tres Vías , Génova , Sorrento , and Puccio . An important part of Rosario \\'s urban character is its riverbank . The city recovered the riverbank of the Paraná not long ago , thanks to a reorganization of terrains formerly owned by the port and the national railroad system . Going from the center immediately north of the port , the riverbank is surrounded by a large number of parks ; Argentine flag Memorial , Parque de España , Parque de las Colectividades and Parque Sunchales . Greater Rosario Through the years , Rosario has spread in all directions . Towards the south , beyond Pellegrini , there are two more boulevards , 27 de Febrero and Seguí , and avenues Uriburu , Arijón and Battle y Ordóñez.To the west , after Oroño , there are the avenues Ovidio Lagos and Francia , Avellaneda Boulevard and Provincias Unidas Avenue . The main neighborhoods in the south are La Tablada , Parque Casado , Las Heras , Las Delicias and Las Flores . The city ends in the Saladillo Stream ( the natural border with Villa Gobernador Gálvez ) . This is just south of the great barrio Grandoli . Among the neighborhoods in the west are Echesortu , Belgrano , Triángulo , Moderno , Godoy , and Fisherton ( near the west end of the city , formerly the home of hierarchical personnel of English railroad companies established in Rosario ) . To the north-east there lie the neighborhoods of Pichincha ( a red-light district in the early 20th century , now home to an open-air antiquities fair : Mercado de antigüedades \" Feria Retro La Huella \" ) , Ludueña , Lisandro de la Torre ( home of the Rosario Central football club ) and Empalme Graneros ; these last three are in the influence area of the Ludueña Stream , now contained by underground piping , but until the 1980s a source of floods . Next to the Rosario Central stadium , there is a large park , Parque Alem , and not far from it , there stands the Sorrento thermoelectric power plant . North of the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood , there are Alberdi ( formerly an independent town ) , La Florida ( with a popular beach resort of the same name ) , and Rucci . The main streets in the north are Alberdi Avenue and its continuation , Rondeau Boulevard ( which leads to the north exit of the city , the access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge , and the town of Granadero Baigorria ) . These major arteries are crossed by several avenues : Las Tres Vías , Génova , Sorrento , and Puccio . Transportation Rosario \\'s strategic location is destined to become a significant transportation hub and as the bi-oceanic corridor that links the State of Rio Grande do Sul ( Brazil ) , an important component in global distribution and the core center of a key corridor in the Mercosur , the Common Market for the South . The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Rosario , for example to and from work , on a weekday is 50 min . 9 % of public transit riders , ride for more than 2 hours every day . The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 14 min , while 19 % of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day . The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is 4.3 km , while 4 % travel for over 12 km in a single direction . Road transport The Rosario public transport system includes buses , trolleybuses and taxicabs . The Rosario trolleybus system consists of only one main trunk line . It is presently operated by a government-owned corporation , SEMTUR ( Sociedad del Estado Municipal para el Transporte Urbano de Rosario , \" Municipal State Society for Rosario Urban Transport \" ) , as are some of Rosario \\'s other urban bus lines . Plaza Sarmiento is the hub of the city bus system , about 40 urban lines in the metropolitan area that provide service every 5 to 10 minutes . Bus fares are pre-paid by means of either a rechargeable plastic card or a disposable paper card with a magnetic stripe which can be bought from post offices , automatic vending machines , and private businesses . For occasional use , a larger fare can be paid using a coin machine in the bus unit . The interurban lines have differential fares , and some allow payment in cash only . The municipal administration is phasing out the paper cards , in favor of the plastic ones , during the second half of 2012 . The urban bus fleet was partially renewed during the recovery of the national economy , since 2003 , and consists of about 730 units . In 2005 the average age of the buses was five years and 11 months . Improvements in the economy have led to increased use of public transport and comparatively less use of bicycles . According to the Rosario Transportation Office , in 2005 there were about 11 million bus journeys per month , by 2007 , usage has climbed to 420,000 people every day ( 12.6 million per month ) . A significant number of buses run on natural gas , as it also happens in Argentina as a whole since the price of this fuel is quite low compared to the alternatives . The idea to transform all buses to this system did not prosper ; most buses run on heavily subsidized diesel fuel . In 2012 bus lanes were added to several pairs of parallel streets traversing the downtown area . Bus stops along these are spaced every three blocks instead of the usual two . For the most part , they leave room to only one additional , narrow lane on the left for cars and other vehicles . They can be used for taxis carrying passengers as well . They are exclusive for public transport during weekdays and on Saturday morning ; stopping or parking on the affected streets is forbidden , as well as right turns . Their implementation attracted opposition from residents and shop owners but was well received by habitual bus users since they reduce the time needed to get out of the crowded central area by a noticeable amount . Rosario has a medium-sized taxi fleet , with units painted black and outlined in yellow . Some belong to radio-taxi companies and can be reserved by telephone ; others only in the streets . As the economy of Argentina recovers , the capacity of the taxi fleet has been strained by higher usage . In September 2005 , the Deliberative Council approved the compulsory installation of radio-call systems in all taxi units , but this requirement has not been fulfilled . Rosario is also a major hub for long-distance overland transportation from the Mariano Moreno Bus Terminal , ( Terminal de Omnibus ) , across from the Patio de la Madera Convention and Exposition Centre complex , about 15 blocks west of Plaza San Martin . The transportation facility serves 73 bus companies in short , medium , and long-distance travel , carrying 1,100.000 passengers per month to 784 national and international destinations , which comprise most major domestic cities including Puerto Iguazú , Salta and Bariloche and international destinations such as Asunción , Paraguay , Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro , Brazil and Montevideo , Uruguay , destinations may be long but white-clad chauffeurs handle comfortable long-distance coaches with modern conveniences . Railway Rosario was one of the main cities chosen by the British and French railway companies that built and operated some of the railways in Argentina during the 19th and early 20th centuries , with more than 15 stations operating in the city . When the entire Argentine railway network was nationalised during the Presidency of Juan Perón , most of the stations ( by then under the administration of State-owned company Ferrocarriles Argentinos ) were closed for passenger services to reduce costs , leaving only a few active . After the railway privatization in the early 1990s during Carlos Menem \\'s presidency , the passenger services were considerably reduced . The lines operated by Nuevo Central Argentino ( NCA ) handle most of the cargo . Additionally , two private companies provided limited passenger services to several major cities . Trenes de Buenos Aires ( TBA ) ran weekly trains south to Retiro in Buenos Aires and north to Santa Fe . The company Ferrocentral also operated weekly trains south to Buenos Aires and northwest to Córdoba and Tucumán . Nowadays , passenger services to Rosario are being operated by state-owned company Trenes Argentinos , running trains to Rosario Norte with stop in Rosario Sur . The other station in the main district , Rosario Oeste , used to concentrate all the passenger services when railways were nationalised in 1948 , but currently operates for freight trains only . As of June 2021 , only two stations remain active for passenger services in the city .

However it never was constructed and the project was finally suspended after the controversy it generated among the citizens and the media critics because of the high costs it implicated . Trams The city once had a large tramway network with 192 km of track in the centre of the city , however this was abandoned in 1963 after fierce competition from bus transport in the city . The city now has two heritage tramways , one of which uses vintage trams converted to run on rubber tyres , while the other uses the original trams from the city refurbished to run on rails.Imágenes - El Tranvia del Bicentinario More recently , a metro system was proposed for the city , though this was shelved in favour of a new urban tramway network . The network is currently in the bidding process , with large firms like Siemens and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China bidding for its construction . It is expected to begin at the recently inaugurated Rosario Sur Station and run northwards through the city . Roadways Rosario is linked to the rest of the country by a number of roads : the Aramburu Highway ( southeast , to Buenos Aires ) , National Route 9 ( from Buenos Aires to Rosario and then north and west up to Jujuy and Bolivia ) , the Brigadier Estanislao López Highway ( north , to Santa Fe City ) , National Route 11 ( to the north of Santa Fe , Formosa and Paraguay ) , National Route 33 ( to the southwest of Santa Fe and the province of Buenos Aires , and then through National Route 7 to San Luis , Mendoza and Chile ) , National Route 34 ( north to Santiago del Estero , Tucumán and Bolivia ) , and National Route 174 ( east , to Entre Ríos , over the Rosario-Victoria Bridge ) . It is surrounded with an extensive system of two belt-highways called Circunvalación Motorway and A012 which in turn set the limits of the city . The beltway is and was built for traffic to avoid the congested city centre , allowing drivers to bypass the city going around it in a much shorter time . In its length , it intersects with National Route 9 , National Route 3 , National Route 34 , National Route 11 and National Route 174 . The official numbering system denotes this road as \" A008 \" but this denomination is mostly unknown by the locals as it is still called \" Avenida de Circunvalación 25 de Mayo \" ( \" 25 of May Beltway Avenue \" ) commemorating the May Revolution of 1810 . Some sections are named after different personalities by local decree . For example : The section from the east end on 27 Boulevard to the crossing of Ayacucho Street ( old exit to the Rosario-Buenos Aires Highway , now access to Provincial Route 21 ) , is called \" National Route A008 Tte . General Juan Carlos Sánchez \" by decree # 232 of 14 May 1981 . The section between National Route 9 and the exit to Santa Fe ( the state capital ) National Route 11 on the intersection with Rondeau Boulevard is called \" National Route A008 Dr . Constantino Razzetti \" by law # 25769 of 1 September 2003 . The A012 is the second beltway at the southeast of the city . It has a semi-circular length centered around the city , running as a long-length beltway . From the National Route 9 junction on km marker 278 , in the town of Esther , to the junction with National Route 11 on km marker 326 in the city of San Lorenzo it runs for . This road is popularly known as the Second Rosario Beltway , as it borders the metropolitan area of greater Rosario . Through National Decree 1595 of 1979 this road switched to federal control . Beforehand this road was called Provincial Route 16 . Airports The Rosario – Islas Malvinas International Airport is located west-northwest from the center of Rosario , a city in the Santa Fe Province of Argentina . The city of Funes lies directly to the west of the airport , and part of the city limit shares a border with the property of the airport grounds . The airport covers an area of 550 hectares ( 1359 acres ) and is operated by the Province of Santa Fe . Aeropuerto Internacional Rosario \" Islas Malvinas \" at Organismo Regulador del Sistema Nacional de Aeropuertos ( ORSNA ) The airport serves the Greater Rosario area and is the main hub for Sol Líneas Aéreas and is also served by Aerolíneas Argentinas , Pluna and Gol Transportes Aéreos . There are domestic flights within Argentina from Rosario to Buenos Aires , Córdoba , Mar del Plata ( via Buenos Aires ) , Mendoza ( vía Córdoba ) , Santa Fe and Villa Gesell ( via Buenos Aires ) cities as well as international services to , Porto Alegre , Brazil , and Punta del Este , Uruguay ( direct flight in summer and via Buenos Aires in fall , winter and spring ) . The airport is at an altitude of . Its longest runway measures . Port The Port of Rosario , is an inland port and a major goods-shipping centre of Argentina , located in the city of Rosario , province of Santa Fe , on the left-hand ( western ) shore of the Paraná River , about upstream from the Atlantic Ocean . At this point of the course of the Paraná River ( Kilometer 420 , Mile 260 ) , there is the depth transition between overseas and river navigation . The main channel of the river directly in front of the port has an advantageous configuration that allows preservation of a depth of with minor periodic dredging . This allows for downstream navigation of vessels up to Panamax standards . The Paraná is about wide at Kilometer 418 . It becomes wide downstream . The port is the largest of a series located in the several cities of the Greater Rosario that lie on the Paraná ; the last ( northernmost ) able of overseas traffic being Puerto General San Martín ( . It is part of the Bi-Oceanic Corridor , which joins the Atlantic with the Pacific Ocean via Buenos Aires , Rosario , Córdoba , and the Cuyo region ; going north–south it forms the axis of the Paraguay-Paraná Hydroway . It directly services the area of Santa Fe that produces a large portion of Argentine exports , and indirectly the whole Mercosur trade bloc . In 2003 the traffic in the port amounted to . Cargo from other parts of Argentina is brought into the port by the railway lines of the Nuevo Central Argentino , communicating with Córdoba ( west ) and Zárate , Buenos Aires ( south ) , as well as the multiple national and provincial roads and highways that converge in Rosario . Communication with the north-eastern part of the country was enhanced by the 2003 opening of the Rosario-Victoria Bridge , that joins the city with the province of Entre Ríos . The Rosario International Airport ( located west ) has also been refurbished to work with cargo traffic . Education Rosario is an important educational centre at a national and international level . It is the home of the National University of Rosario ( UNR ) since 1968 , which includes the Law Faculty , the Medicine Faculty , the Humanities Faculty and an advanced study centre called Ciudad Universitaria de Rosario ( university city of Rosario ) that is home to more than 10 colleges , among them the Faculty of Psychology , the Faculty of Political Sciences , and the Faculty of Architecture . It is also home of the Rosario Regional Faculty , a branch of the National Technological University ( UTN ) . All of these national colleges are free . In the city there are approximately 624 establishments destined for elementary levels and secondary education , the Technical Institute , which depends directly on the UNR . With a solid tradition as for university education , it is head of several academic institutions , and is public , and free access . Currently , there are some 80,000 University students at various institutions around the city , representing approximately 8.5 % of the whole inhabitants . This rate is one of the highest in Argentina . In Rosario , nearly 15 % of the population benefits from higher education degrees , or have undergone at least some University studies sometime . Rosario has private colleges , as the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina ( UCA ) , the Austral University , the University of the Latin American Educational Center ( UCEL ) , the Interamerican Open University ( UAI ) , the Italian University of Rosario ( IUNIR ) , the San Martin University and the University of Concepcion del Uruguay which are private institutions . Language Rosario is the third largest urban center where Rioplatense Spanish is spoken , after Buenos Aires and Montevideo . The local language evidences the typical linguistic features that characterize this dialect , notably the voseo ( use of vos instead of tú as pronoun for the second person singular ) and the sheísmo ( form of yeísmo where ll- and y- are pronounced as a voiceless ) . Although the español rosarino does not differ substantially from the other variants of the same dialect , it presents particularities easily noticeable by those who live in the other main populated areas of the region . One of the most notable characteristics of the language of Rosario \\'s area of influence is the process of aspiration and disappearance of the -s . When the -s is in implosive position , end of syllable or word followed by consonant , its sound becomes a soft and voiceless aspiration [ h ] ( the word obispo is pronounced o̞ˈβihpo̞ ) . In the popular and vulgar language , the final -s , -r , or -d are sometimes suppressed , although this phenomenon is commonly associated to sociocultural groups of lower formal education . Just as in Buenos Aires , the voseo is pronominal and verbal . The pronoun tú and its associated verbal forms are inexistent ( which is not the case of the Montevideo variant ) The tendency to add a final -s to the verbal forms of the second person plural ( vos fuistes , vos vinistes ) , which is rather common in Buenos Aires , is very unusual among Rosario natives . The intonation in Rosario is generally more neutral and monotonous than that of Buenos Aires . Even though the lexicon of Rosario and Buenos Aires is effectively identical , there are numerous terms and idioms that Rosario shares with the rest of the country ( even areas where a different dialect prevails ) but not with the capital , as well as other words and expressions that are unique to the rosarino speech , both formal and informal . The Rosarigasino is a type of Jerigonza ( game of words ) that originated in the city and was rather common in the informal speech during the 20th century . Although it has fallen into disuse , it has become a language of cult among certain local groups . Sports Rosario is the home of the football clubs Rosario Central ( founded 1889 ) and Newell \\'s Old Boys ( founded 1903 ) . Both play in Primera División Argentina . Central has won four National championships ( in 1971 , 1973 , 1980 and in 1987 ) , six National cups ( 1913 , 1915 , two cups in 1916 , 1920 and 2018 ) , and one international title : the Conmebol Cup ( in 1995 , precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana ) .Diario On Line \" Edición Nacional \" Newell \\'s has 6 National championships ( in 1974 , 1988 , 1991 , 1992 , 2004 and in 2013 ) and 3 National cups ( in 1911 , 1921 and in 1949 ) .

The city has average temperatures of maximum and minimum . The annual rainfall is . Rosario is usually warmer than other mainland Argentine capital cities in the winter . The lowest average in winter is . This is due in part to the city \\'s flat topography , its situation on the Paraná River bank , and the presence of high density of urbanization . Those conditions have created a microclimate known as urban heat island that often means that the city is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas . The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day and larger in winter than in summer , and is most apparent when winds are weak . However , snowfalls are extremely rare : the most recent occurrence of sleet in the CBD was on 9 July 2007 .

About 96 % of homes have a domestic telephone line , giving a total of 472,170 lines ; cell phone usage has also become pervasive , as happened in Argentina as a whole since the beginning of the 21st century , reaching over 86 % of the residents ( 866,000 mobile lines in July 2004 ) . This demand , boosted by low prices and sale promotions , and coupled with restrictions on the installation of antennas and alleged lack of investment by the providers , sometimes degrades the quality of the service . Most notably , the mobile network collapsed almost completely in the celebrations of Christmas , New Year \\'s Day and Friend \\'s Day in 2004 and 2005 . Notable people Notable people from Rosario include the revolutionary Che Guevara ; artist Lucio Fontana ; football players Lionel Messi , Ángel Di María , Maximiliano Rodríguez , Ángel Correa , Giovanni Lo Celso , Mauro Icardi , and Hugo Gutiérrez ; football coaches César Luis Menotti , Marcelo Bielsa and Gerardo Martino ; field hockey player Luciana Aymar ; rugby union players Juan Imhoff and Leonardo Senatore ; actor/comedian Alberto Olmedo and actress Libertad Lamarque ; jazz composer Gato Barbieri ; cartoonist Roberto Fontanarrosa ; singer-songwriter Fito Páez ; painter Antonio Berni ; operatic tenor José Cura ; writers Angélica Gorodischer and Patricio Pron ; film director Felipe Martinez Carbonell ; mathematician , Jana Rodriguez Hertz , and model Valeria Mazza .

Shevchenko played as a striker for Dynamo Kyiv , AC Milan , Chelsea and the Ukraine national team . He was most recently head coach of Serie A club Genoa . Shevchenko is considered one of the most lethal strikers to ever play the game . He is ranked as the seventh top goalscorer in all European competitions with 67 goals . With a tally of 175 goals scored for Milan , he is the second most prolific player in the history of the club , and is also the all-time top scorer of the Derby della Madonnina ( the derby between Milan and their local rivals Inter Milan ) with 14 goals . Furthermore , he is the all-time top scorer for the Ukrainian national team with 48 goals . Shevchenko \\'s career has been highlighted by many awards , the most prestigious of which was the Ballon d\\'Or in 2004 ( becoming the third Ukrainian , after Oleg Blokhin and Igor Belanov , to receive it ) . He won the UEFA Champions League in 2003 with Milan , and he has also won various league and cup titles in Ukraine , Italy and England . He was also a Champions League runner-up in 2005 and 2008 . He was named in the FIFA World XI for 2005 . In 2004 , he was named as one of the Top 100 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA \\'s 100th anniversary celebration . In his international career , the striker led Ukraine as captain to the quarter-finals in their first ever FIFA World Cup appearance in 2006 , and also took part at UEFA Euro 2012 on home soil . On 28 July 2012 , Shevchenko announced that he was quitting football for politics . He stood for election to the Ukrainian Parliament in the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election , but his party failed to win parliamentary representation . He returned to football in 2016 , as assistant coach of the Ukraine national team February to July , at the time led by Mykhaylo Fomenko . In July 2016 , Shevchenko was appointed Ukraine \\'s head coach , and led the nation to the quarter-finals at UEFA Euro 2020 . Early life Shevchenko was born in Dvirkivshchyna , Ukrainian SSR . He was born in the family of Praporshchik Mykola Hryhorovych Shevchenko . In 1979 , his family moved to the newly built neighbourhood in Kyiv – Obolon ( Minsk District was created in 1975 ) . In Kyiv , Shevchenko went to the 216th City School and in 1986 ( aged 9 ) enrolled into the football section coached by Oleksandr Shpakov . Because of the accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant , together with his sport group he was evacuated temporarily from the city . At an early age , he also was a competitive boxer in the LLWI Ukrainian junior league , but eventually he elected to move on to football . Club career Dynamo Kyiv In 1986 , Shevchenko failed a dribbling test for entrance to a specialist sports school in Kyiv , but happened to catch the eye of a Dynamo Kyiv scout while playing in a youth tournament , and was thus brought to the club . Four years later , Shevchenko was on the Dynamo under-14 team for the Ian Rush Cup ( now the Welsh Super Cup ) ; he finished as the tournament \\'s top scorer and was awarded a pair of Rush \\'s boots as a prize by the then-Liverpool player . Shevchenko started out his professional career at age 16 when he came on for only 12 minutes as a substitute in a 0–2 home loss to the Odessa second team Chornomorets-2 Odessa on 5 May 1993 . He was a substitute for the last six home games of the 1992–93 Ukrainian First League and did not score any goals . The next 1993–94 season at the second tier , Shevchenko was the top goal scorer for Dynamo-2 with 12 goals , and he made his first appearance in the starting XI . Shevchenko scored his first goal against Krystal Chortkiv at the home 1–1 draw on 7 October 1993 . During the same season , he recorded his first hat-trick in a home game against Artania Ochakiv on 21 November 1993 which Dynamo-2 won 4–1 . Shevchenko stayed with Dynamo-2 until the end of 1994 and once again he was called up for one game in late 1996 . He made his Vyshcha Liha debut for Dynamo squad on 8 November 1994 in an away game against Shakhtar Donetsk when he was 18 . It was actually his second game for the senior squad overall after he played a home game of National Cup competition on 5 November 1994 against Skala Stryi . That year Shevchenko became a national champion and became a cup holder with Dynamo . He won his second league title the next season , scoring 6 goals in 20 matches . He scored a hat-trick in the first half of a 1997–98 UEFA Champions League away match against Barcelona , which Dynamo won 4–0 ; no other visitor to the Camp Nou scored a Champions League treble until 2021 . His 19 goals in 23 league matches and six goals in ten Champions League matches ( including a hat-trick over two legs against Real Madrid ) were followed by 28 total goals in all competitions in 1998–99 . He won the domestic league title with Dynamo in each of his five seasons with the club . AC Milan In 1999 , Shevchenko joined Italian club AC Milan for a then-record transfer fee of $ 25 million . He made his league debut on 28 August 1999 in a 2–2 draw with Lecce . Alongside five other players – Michel Platini , John Charles , Gunnar Nordahl , István Nyers , and Ferenc Hirzer – he managed , as a foreign player , to win the Serie A scoring title in his debut season , finishing with 24 goals in 32 matches . Shevchenko maintained his excellent form into the 2000–01 season , scoring 24 goals in 34 matches , including nine goals in 14 Champions League games . During the same season , he also reunited with Kakha Kaladze as teammates when Milan signed the Georgian defender from Dynamo Kyiv in January 2001 . Despite netting only five times in 24 matches , mainly due to injuries , Shevchenko became the first Ukrainian-born player to win the Champions League after Milan lifted their sixth trophy in 2002–03 . He scored the crucial away goal against rivals Inter Milan in the semi-final , and then scored the winning penalty in the shoot out against Juventus in the final , which had ended goalless after extra time . Following Milan winning the Champions League , Shevchenko flew to Kyiv to put his medal by the grave of Valeriy Lobanovskyi ( who he was managed by when he was at Dynamo ) , who died in 2002 . He finished top goalscorer in Serie A in 2003–04 for the second time in his career , scoring 24 goals in 32 matches as Milan won the Scudetto for the first time in five years . He also scored the winning goal in the UEFA Super Cup victory over Porto , leading to Milan \\'s second trophy of the season . In August 2004 , he scored three goals against Lazio as Milan won the Supercoppa Italiana . Shevchenko capped off the year by being awarded the 2004 Ballon d\\'Or , becoming the third Ukrainian player ever to win the award after Oleg Blokhin and Igor Belanov . In the same year , Shevchenko was also inducted into the FIFA 100 . He scored 17 goals in the 2004–05 season after missing several games with a fractured cheekbone . Shevchenko made Champions League history the following season ; on 23 November 2005 , he scored all four goals in Milan \\'s 4–0 group stage drubbing of Fenerbahçe , becoming only the fifth player to accomplish this feat ; his company includes Marco van Basten , Simone Inzaghi , Dado Pršo and Ruud van Nistelrooy ( while Lionel Messi joined that group in the 2009–10 season and Robert Lewandowski in 2012–13 and 2019–20 ) , and Shevchenko was the only player to have done it in an away game until Olivier Giroud did so for Chelsea , away to Sevilla , in the 2020-21 season . Milan eventually lost the tournament when Shevchenko missed the crucial penalty in the final against Liverpool . In the 2005–06 Champions League , he scored his last Milan goal in the second leg of the quarter-final as they eliminated Lyon after a last-minute comeback in a 3–1 victory . In the semi-final , Milan lost to eventual winners Barcelona 1–0 , a match where Shevchenko controversially had a last minute equaliser denied by the referee . Despite this , he still ended up being the top scorer of the whole competition with 9 goals in 12 games . On 8 February 2006 , Shevchenko became Milan \\'s second highest all-time goalscorer , behind Gunnar Nordahl , after netting against Treviso . He finished the season as joint fourth-top scorer with 19 goals in 28 games . Shevchenko ended his seven-year stint with Milan with 175 goals in 296 games . Chelsea During the summer of 2005 , there were persistent reports that Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich offered a record sum €73 million and striker Hernán Crespo to Milan in exchange for Shevchenko . Milan refused the monetary offer but took Crespo on loan . Chelsea chief executive Peter Kenyon was quoted as saying , \" I think Shevchenko is the type of player we would like . At the end of the day to improve what we have got , it has to be a great player and Shevchenko certainly comes into that class . \" Shevchenko cited that the persistence of Abramovich was a key factor in his move . Milan , desperate to keep the striker , offered Shevchenko a six-year contract extension . On 28 May 2006 , Shevchenko left Milan for Chelsea for £30.8 million ( €43.875million ) , topping Michael Essien \\'s transfer fee from the previous year and also breaking the record for a player signed by an English club . He received the number seven shirt , as Chelsea manager José Mourinho said that Shevchenko could continue wearing it . Shevchenko made his debut for Chelsea on 13 August 2006 in the FA Community Shield , scoring his side \\'s goal in a 2–1 loss to Liverpool . On 23 August , he scored his first Premier League goal – and his 300th in top-flight and international football – in a 2–1 loss to Middlesbrough . He scored goals sporadically throughout the season , including equalisers against Porto and Valencia in the 2006–07 Champions League and another against London rival club Tottenham Hotspur in the FA Cup to help take his side into the semi-final . He finished with a total of 14 from 51 games . During the campaign , he netted his 57th career goal in European competitions , leaving him second behind Gerd Müller on the all-time European goalscorers list , before Filippo Inzaghi made the record his own in the 2007–08 Champions League . Shevchenko \\'s 2006–07 season was cut short due to injury and a hernia operation . He missed the Champions League semi-final against Liverpool and the FA Cup final against Manchester United at the new Wembley Stadium on 19 May 2007 . He did , however , start for Chelsea in the 2007 League Cup final victory over Arsenal in which he hit the bar which would have given Chelsea a 3–1 lead . { } Shevchenko was handed his first start of the 2007–08 season against Blackburn Rovers at home to cover for the injured Didier Drogba , but the game finished goalless . His first goal of the season came three days later , equalising for Chelsea in a match against Rosenborg , which turned out to be José Mourinho \\'s last game as manager of Chelsea . Throughout the season , Shevchenko was in and out of the starting line-up because of injuries and the appointment of Avram Grant following the departure of Mourinho . During the Christmas period , however , Shevchenko enjoyed a good run of form . He scored the first goal in Chelsea \\'s 2–0 win over Sunderland , and he was named man of the match in Chelsea \\'s 4–4 draw against Aston Villa at Stamford Bridge , scoring twice ( including a stunning 25-yard shot into the top left hand corner ) and assisting Alex to make the score 3–2 in Chelsea \\'s favour . Shevchenko scored his last goal in the 2007–08 season in a 1–1 draw with Bolton Wanderers . He finished the season with five league goals in 17 games . Shevchenko also played a part in a pre-season match which was against his former team , Milan . Loan to AC Milan Shevchenko was not used very often in the starting line-up at Chelsea , and with the appointment of Luiz Felipe Scolari , he was deemed surplus to requirements . Due to this , Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani offered to take Shevchenko back to the San Siro and Shevchenko was loaned back to his old club for the 2008–09 season . Shevchenko \\'s failed to score any league goals and only scored 2 goals in 26 appearances , starting only nine of those games . He returned to Chelsea for the final year of his four-year contract , where he was joined by his former Milan manager Carlo Ancelotti . Departure Shevchenko was not even on the bench for Chelsea \\'s penalty shoot-out victory over Manchester United at Wembley at the weekend in the season-opening Community Shield . After making a late appearance for Chelsea in their second game of the 2009–10 season , Ancelotti announced that Shevchenko would be likely to leave Chelsea before the summer transfer window closed . Despite this , Ancelotti said it had nothing to do with his decision to leave Shevchenko out of Chelsea \\'s 2009–10 Champions League squad , but just to continue playing first-team football . Return to Dynamo Kyiv On 28 August 2009 , Shevchenko signed a two-year deal at his former club Dynamo Kyiv and scored a penalty-goal in his first game upon returning to his former club against Metalurh Donetsk in Dynamo \\'s 3–1 victory on 31 August . He was mostly used as a left winger and central mid-fielder , and was named left winger in the 2009 team of the season . On 16 September , Shevchenko played his first Champions League match after returning to Dynamo , against Rubin Kazan , in Dynamo \\'s first game of the 2009–10 season . In October , he was named the best player of the Ukrainian Premier League . On 4 November , he scored a goal in the game against Inter , cross-city rivals of his former club Milan , in the fourth game of the Champions League season . It was the 15th goal he had scored against Inter in his career . On 28 July 2012 , Shevchenko announced that he was quitting football for politics . International career Shevchenko achieved 111 caps and scored 48 goals for the Ukrainian national team , whom he represented at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012 . He earned his first cap in 1995 and scored his first international goal in May 1996 in a friendly against Turkey . During qualification for the 1998 World Cup , Shevchenko scored three times as Ukraine finished second in Group G to earn a place in the play-offs . Ukraine were knocked out 3–1 on aggregate by Croatia , the team who would go on to finish third in the finals , with Shevchenko scoring Ukraine \\'s goal in the home leg . Ukraine performed similarly impressively in UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying , again making the play-offs after finishing one point behind World Champions France in Group 4 . However , the team again failed at the play-off stage , losing to underdogs Slovenia . Overall , Shevchenko scored four times for Ukraine during their Euro 2000 qualifying campaign . In March 2000 , Dynamo manager Valeri Lobanovsky became Ukraine \\'s coach , with the aim to qualify for the 2002 World Cup finals . Shevchenko scored ten goals in the qualifiers , but Ukraine again failed to qualify after losing a play-off , this time against Germany . He then scored a total of three goals in Ukraine \\'s Euro 2004 qualifying round , but the team failed to qualify for the play-offs , finishing below Greece and Spain in third place in Group 6 . Shevchenko scored six goals in qualifying for the 2006 World Cup , to take his country to its first ever major tournament . He captained the team at the finals and scored in Ukraine \\'s first ever World Cup win , a 4–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia . He then scored the winning goal from a penalty kick as Ukraine beat Tunisia 1–0 to qualify for the second round where , despite Shevchenko failing with their first kick , Ukraine knocked out Switzerland on penalties . Ukraine were then beaten 3–0 by eventual champions Italy at the quarter-final stage . After only playing two games for Milan in the 2008–09 season , Shevcehnko was still the first choice for Ukraine , and he scored an equaliser in an 2010 World Cup qualifying match against England at Wembley Stadium . Ukraine , however , went on to lose the game 2–1 after his former Chelsea teammate John Terry scored from a free kick delivered by David Beckham . In a 21 December 2009 interview with UEFA , Shevchenko declared that he was keen to play in his home country at Euro 2012 . \" After a disappointing 2010 World Cup qualifying campaign , that is my new challenge , or even dream . I will do everything to achieve that . \" In May 2012 , Shevchenko was named in the Ukrainian squad for Euro 2012 . In Ukraine \\'s opening game , Shevchenko scored two headers to beat Sweden 2–1 in Group D . After his country was eliminated from the group , Shevchenko announced he would retire from international football , having been Ukraine \\'s youngest and oldest goalscorer and record marksman with 48 goals in 111 appearances . Style of play A fast , hardworking , energetic , and well-rounded striker , Shevchenko was a prolific and highly opportunistic goalscorer , who was usually deployed as an out-and-out striker in a centre-forward role , although he was capable of operating anywhere along the front line , and often played in a free role , in which he could attack from the left wing , and get past opposing defenders with his runs into the penalty area , courtesy of his pace and movement off the ball . He also occupied a wider position as an outright winger on the left flank at times , in particular at the beginning of his career , and also during his second stint with Dynamo Kyiv during his later years ; he was also capable of playing on the right . Shevchenko was also effective from set-pieces , and was an accurate penalty taker . A strong and physical striker with an eye for goal , he was primarily known for his excellent positional sense , movement off the ball , and finishing ability inside the box , as well as his composure in front of goal ; moreover , he possessed a powerful and accurate shot with either foot , from both inside and outside the area . Although he was not known to take part in aerial duels frequently , he was also good in the air , due to his heading ability . Often compared by pundits to fellow former Milan striker Marco van Basten , although he was not as elegant as the Dutch forward , he also possessed good technique ; furthermore , despite mainly being a goalscorer , he was capable of playing off of his teammates , in addition to scoring goals himself , due to his link-up play . Coaching and managerial career Ukraine national team In November 2012 , Shevchenko initially refused to accept Football Federation of Ukraine \\'s proposal to become head coach of the Ukraine national team . From 16 February to 15 July 2016 , Shevchenko served as the assistant manager of the Ukraine national team . On 15 July 2016 , Shevchenko was appointed as manager of the Ukraine national team . The 39-year-old replaced Mykhaylo Fomenko , whose four-year spell ended with elimination at the group stage of Euro 2016 . He signed a two-year contract with the possibility of another two-year extension . Former Italy and Milan defender Mauro Tassotti , who was assistant coach when Shevchenko was at Milan , joined his coaching staff , as did former Dynamo coach Raúl Riancho , and former AC Milan Youth System coach Andrea Maldera . On 14 October 2019 , Shevchenko led Ukraine to qualify for Euro 2020 with a 2–1 home win over reigning European champions Portugal . At UEFA Euro 2020 , Shevchenko led Ukraine to reach the quarter-finals of the European Championship for the first time in their history . His side finished as one of the four best third-placed teams in the group stage , then beating Sweden in extra time in the round of 16 and suffering an exit to England in the next round . Despite Ukraine ’ s successful tournament , on 1 August 2021 , he announced his departure from the post . Genoa On 7 November 2021 , Shevchenko was announced as the new head coach of Serie A side Genoa , following the club \\'s takeover by US investment firm 777 Partners , replacing Davide Ballardini . He signed a contract until 2024 for the 18th-placed team who had won once in 12 games . Two weeks later , he lost 2–0 on his debut at home to Roma , managed by his former Chelsea boss José Mourinho . On 15 January 2022 , Shevchenko was sacked after two months having won just one match and lost seven during the time . Political career In the late 1990s , Shevchenko and other teammates of Dynamo Kyiv publicly backed the Social Democratic Party of Ukraine ( united ) . After his retirement in June 2012 , Shevchenko immediately joined Ukraine – Forward ! ( formerly known as Ukrainian Social Democratic Party ) and took second place on the party list for the October 2012 Ukrainian parliamentary election . This was in spite of him stating a month earlier that he wanted to coach after his playing career : \" This is the world I understand , the world I want to stay in . \" In the election his party won 1.58 % of the national votes and no constituencies and thus failed to win parliamentary representation . Personal life Shevchenko \\'s first name ( in Ukrainian ) has multiple ways of being transliterated from its original spelling in the Ukrainian Cyrillic alphabet into the Latin alphabet ; Andriy is the spelling used throughout the player \\'s official web site . It has also been adopted by UEFA and FIFA and is the preferred spelling in most English publications . Shevchenko is married to American model Kristen Pazik . The couple met at a Giorgio Armani afterparty in 2002 , and married on 14 July 2004 in a private ceremony on a golf course in Washington , D.C . As of 2006 , the couple communicated in Italian as he spoke no English and she spoke no Ukrainian .

The couple have four sons : Jordan , born on 29 October 2004 , Kristian , born on 10 November 2006 , Alexander , born on 1 October 2012 and Rider Gabriel , born on 6 April 2014 . Shevchenko commemorated Jordan \\'s birth by scoring against Sampdoria the following day ( Milan won 1–0 ) . Milan owner and former Prime Minister of Italy Silvio Berlusconi is the godfather of Shevchenko \\'s first son , Jordan . The day after Kristian \\'s birth , Shevchenko scored in a 4–0 Chelsea victory over Watford and he and several of his teammates gathered and performed the popular \" rock-the-baby \" goal celebration as a tribute . Shevchenko is a close friend of fashion designer Giorgio Armani , and has modelled for Armani and opened two boutiques with him in Kyiv .

He took over as coach of Getafe and had notable success there . He brought the club comparative success in the Copa del Rey and UEFA Cup , and the team \\'s attacking style received plaudits . On 15 June 2012 , Laudrup was appointed the manager of Premier League club Swansea City on a two-year contract . In his first season in south Wales , he won the League Cup , the first major English trophy in Swansea \\'s 100-year history . On 4 February 2014 , he was sacked by Swansea after a \" significant \" slump in the Premier League , leaving them two points above the relegation zone . Laudrup then managed Qatari clubs Lekhwiya and Al Rayyan between 2014 and 2018 . Club career Born in Frederiksberg , Copenhagen , Michael Laudrup began playing football in father Finn Laudrup \\'s childhood club Vanløse . When Finn Laudrup became player/coach of Brøndby IF in 1973 , the family moved to Brøndby and both Michael and his brother Brian Laudrup started playing for the club as well . Michael followed his father to the top-flight Danish 1st Division club Københavns Boldklub in 1976 , while Brian remained at Brøndby . Early career Laudrup made his senior debut playing for KB ( Kjøbenhavns Boldklub ) in 1981 , and made his debut for the Danish under-19 national team in February 1981 . In all , he scored a combined total of 14 goals in 25 games at various youth levels . He went back to play for Brøndby in 1982 , where his father had ended his career in 1981 , contributing to the promotion of Brøndby to the 1st Division . At Brøndby , Laudrup scored two goals in the club \\'s 1st Division debut game , as fellow promoted team Boldklubben 1909 were beaten 7–1 . He scored 15 league goals in 1982 , and ended the season as the third top goal scorer of the 1st Division . His accomplishments earned him the 1982 Danish Player of the Year award . He played part of the 1983 season for Brøndby , and scored nine goals , before he was sold to defending Serie A champions Juventus from Italy in June 1983 . It was the biggest transfer deal in Danish football at the time , worth around $ 1 million . He was due to sign for Liverpool the same year on a three-year contract , but at the last minute , Liverpool proposed a four-year contract and Laudrup opted not to sign . Under restriction of a maximum of two foreign players in the team , of which the club had Polish midfielder Zbigniew Boniek and Michel Platini , Juventus initially lent Laudrup to newly promoted Rome club Lazio for a single season , something he had not been informed about before signing for Juventus . With Lazio , he scored two goals in his Serie A debut , a 2–4 loss to Hellas Verona . In his first year at Lazio , Lazio narrowly avoided relegation , but as Juventus wanted to keep Boniek and Platini , he stayed for another year . Lazio started the 1984–85 season poorly , eventually finishing in last place to become relegated to Serie B . Laudrup scored just one goal that season . Laudrup returned to Juventus in summer 1985 to replace Zbigniew Boniek , playing alongside Michel Platini . In his first year at the club , he won the 1985–86 Serie A as well as the Intercontinental Cup trophy , scoring the equalising goal in the final of the latter tournament , although he later missed a penalty in the resulting shoot-out ; he was once again named Danish Player of the Year in 1985 . However , the following season was not a success for Laudrup , who suffered multiple injuries . When Platini retired in 1987 , Laudrup was expected to lead the team in his place , playing alongside newly bought Welsh forward Ian Rush . But Laudrup failed to live up to Platini \\'s standards and did not score any goals , despite playing all 30 matches of the 1987–88 season . Barcelona After an unsuccessful season with Juventus , Laudrup decided it was time to leave , looking for a new experience after six years in Italy . In 1989 , he joined Spanish club Barcelona on the premise that Netherlands coach Johan Cruyff , his childhood role model , had been assembling a team that was striving for success . Immediately , Laudrup enjoyed major success under Cruyff \\'s leadership , citing the Dutchman \\'s philosophy and perception of the game as one of the main assets that helped foster his talent . He was one of the restricted three foreign players allowed in the team , alongside Dutch defender Ronald Koeman and Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoichkov , who were the pillars of the Barça \" Dream Team \" , along with rising stars Pep Guardiola , José Mari Bakero , and Txiki Begiristain . The Dream Team played attractive football that was comparable to the 1970s Ajax team , and won four consecutive La Liga championships from 1991 to 1994 , as well as the 1991–92 European Cup , along with the 1992 UEFA Super Cup , 1989–90 Copa del Rey and 1991 and 1992 Supercopa de España titles . Laudrup was twice named the best player of the year in Spain during his Barcelona years . When Barça hired a fourth foreign star player , Brazilian striker Romário in 1993 , it meant the four foreigners would rotate as the three foreign players allowed in each match , and when he was not selected for the 1994 European Cup final 0–4 loss to Milan ( amid conflicts with Cruyff ) , his time at Barcelona was effectively over . After the match , Milan \\'s manager Fabio Capello remarked : \" Laudrup was the guy I feared but Cruyff left him out , and that was his mistake . \" Laudrup \\'s departure from Barcelona was a huge blow for the fans and his teammates alike . Pep Guardiola was reportedly so upset by the news that he cried and begged Laudrup to change his mind . Reflecting on his time at Barcelona , Laudrup commented , \" I think we played some very good football , and I think most of all we demonstrated that even without getting the ten best players in the world , you can have the best team . Because everybody talked about Begiristain , Bakero , Guardiola , Stoichkov , and Koeman , but when we started none of us was a best player , then we became maybe the best team in the world , together with AC Milan in that period . \" Real Madrid In 1994 , Laudrup completed a controversial move from Barça to Real Madrid after he fell out with Johan Cruyff . On this , Laudrup stated he did not have a hidden agenda . It was the year after the 1994 FIFA World Cup and according to him , because players usually suffer a drop in performance after such a major international tournament , he correctly predicted that Barcelona would not win major trophies the following season . Despite widespread belief Laudrup joined arch-rivals Real Madrid in an attempt to \" get back \" at Cruyff , the decision was based on the fact Real Madrid had been struggling for a long period and were eager to return to supremacy , like Barcelona when he decided to join them . Laudrup said , \" People say I wanted to go to Real Madrid just to get revenge . I say revenge from what ? I \\'ve had a perfect time ; five fantastic years here [ at Barcelona ] . I went to Madrid because they were so hungry to win , and they had four or five players who went to the World Cup . I said this would be perfect ; new coach , new players , and hungry to win . \" On 5 November 1994 , he assisted Raúl \\'s first professional goal in a 4–2 win over Atlético Madrid Laudrup went on to guide Real Madrid in a championship-winning season that would end the Barça stranglehold , making him the only player ever to win the Spanish league five times in a row playing for two different clubs . After the initial success at Real , a lacklustre season would be in store for the club . Despite only playing two seasons at Real Madrid , he was voted the 12th-best player in Real Madrid history in an internet survey by Spanish newspaper Marca when the club celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2002 . While playing with Barcelona , he participated in the 5–0 victory over rivals Real Madrid in the 1993–94 season . The following season while playing for Real Madrid , he aided in the revenge beating Madrid gave Barça , the final score also ending 5–0 . Daniel Storey wrote of Laudrup , \" no other player is loved on both sides of the clásico divide quite like Laudrup \" as he remains held in high regard by both Barça and Madrid fans . Following the match , Laudrup \\'s former Barcelona manager Cruyff commented : \" When Michael plays like a dream , a magic illusion , determined to show his new team his extreme abilities , no one in the world comes anywhere near his level . \" Later career and retirement In 1996 , Laudrup left Real Madrid to play for Vissel Kobe in Japan . On 18 August 1996 , he played his first match for Vissel Kobe and scored two goals in a 4–2 win against Brummell Sendai . He helped Vissel to promotion from the second-tier Japan Football League to the J1 League . He was registered as a player in Bosnian Premier League club Čelik Zenica in a controversial signing in which he did not play any games for Čelik , but was signed as a player . After the details were resolved , he ended his playing career in a championship winning season at Dutch side Ajax in 1998 . Following his retirement , Laudrup sometimes turned out to play for Lyngby \\'s Old Boys team in his spare time . International career Laudrup was called up for the Denmark national team during Brøndby \\'s debut season in the top-flight . On his 18th birthday on 15 June 1982 , he became the then-second-youngest Danish national team player ever , following Harald Nielsen . Despite playing for relegation battlers Lazio , Laudrup starred for the Denmark national team at UEFA Euro 1984 , playing all four of Denmark \\'s matches . Laudrup participated in the 1986 FIFA World Cup in Mexico , a performance which is best remembered for his exceptional solo dribble and goal in the 6–1 defeat of Uruguay . He was also a part of the disappointing Denmark squad at Euro 1988 , though Laudrup experienced personal success , scoring one of Denmark \\'s two goals . Following three matches in the qualification campaign for Euro 1992 , Laudrup opted to quit the national team in November 1990 ( alongside his brother Brian Laudrup and Jan Mølby ) following differences with coach Richard Møller Nielsen . The Danes originally failed to qualify but were later given Yugoslavia \\'s place as Yugoslavia were disqualified due to war in their country . Notwithstanding their qualification , Laudrup rated Denmark \\'s chances of success so low he stayed on holiday . However , Denmark caused one of the biggest upsets in football history by going on to win the tournament , beating holders the Netherlands in the semi-final and , in the final beating reigning world champions and favourites Germany , with a 2–0 win thanks to goals from John Jensen and Kim Vilfort . Laudrup returned to Nielsen \\'s Danish squad in August 1993 , but saw Spain and the Republic of Ireland qualify for the 1994 World Cup ahead of Denmark . He scored a goal in the 2–0 victory against Argentina , as Denmark won the 1995 Intercontinental Cup . He also scored four goals in ten matches as Denmark qualified for Euro 1996 . Laudrup \\'s last matches for Denmark came at the 1998 World Cup , when he captained the nation to the quarter-final . Laudrup made his 100th appearance for Denmark in the team \\'s opening game of the tournament , a 1–0 defeat of Saudi Arabia in Lens . Denmark was defeated 2–3 by Brazil in the quarter-finals , and both Michael and Brian Laudrup announced their international retirement following the elimination . Both brothers ended their international careers on a high note as both Michael and Brian were named in FIFA \\'s All-Star Team . Player profile Style of play A quick , intelligent and talented midfielder , known for his pace on the ball , Laudrup is regarded as one of the most effective and versatile attacking midfielders , as well as one of the most skilful and elegant players in the history of the game . Although primarily an offensive playmaker , he was capable of playing in several positions in or behind the front-line , and was even deployed as a winger , as a central midfielder or deep-lying playmaker , or as a second striker on occasion , in particular in his youth , or even as a forward or striker on rarer instances ; he was also used as a centre-forward on occasion under his Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff , a role which was similar to that of the modern false 9 role . Laudrup is considered by many in the sport as one of the best passers of all time , and as one of the most technically accomplished players ever . Regarding Laudrup \\'s vision and passing ability , his brother Brian stated in 2008 : \" My brother started as an attacker but became an elegant attacking midfielder , perhaps the most complete there has ever been . His vision , speed of thought and passing were on a different level ; he always knew what was going to happen before anybody else did . If anyone had a \\'football brain \\' , it was him . \" Despite being primarily a creative team player , he also possessed an accurate shot , and was capable of scoring goals as well as creating them . Nicknamed \" The Prince of Denmark , \" throughout his career , Laudrup was acclaimed for his technique , balance , elegance , ball control , and dribbling ability , as well as his vision , ability to read the game , and range of passing , including deep passes , through balls , and crosses , which made him an excellent assist provider . In regard to his vision , Jorge Valdano , the Argentinian coach of Laudrup in Real Madrid , said , \" [ H ] e has eyes everywhere . \" His trademark move – looking one way and passing the other – fooled countless opponents during his career . The Laudrup dribble , a signature feint also known as the croqueta , was perhaps the best-known part of his game , and involved him quickly moving the ball from one foot to the other away from the defender , a move which was later also popularised by later Barcelona midfielder Andrés Iniesta . Laudrup \\'s ball skills and feints were combined with creativity , which he used to get past defenders in one on one situations . This led to the expression \" Made in Laudrup \" being coined in the Spanish football media , which was widely used in Spain to describe his trademark assists , in particular his lobbed passes , as well as his unique play . According to a 2018 article by Josh Butler of The Athletic and These Football Times , several of Laudrup \\'s teammates said of his creative style of play : \" Just run , he will always find a way of passing you the ball . \" Reception Throughout his career , Laudrup was often ranked among the best players in the world , with the French three-time European footballer of the year award winner Michel Platini describing him as one of the most talented players ever , only lamenting his lack of selfishness causing him to score too few goals . In a 2006 interview , Laudrup \\'s Real Madrid teammate Raúl called him the best player he had ever played with , a view echoed by his Barcelona teammate Romário , who opined that he was able to create and score goals almost at will , and ranked him the fourth-best player in the history of the game ( behind Pelé , Diego Maradona and himsel ) . Luís Figo instead labelled Laudrup as arguably the best opponent he had ever faced . Ronald Koeman rated Laudrup as \" possibly the most skillful and elegant player [ he ] ever played with , \" adding : \" Few could dribble like he could . He could sense when a game was ready to be seized and transformed by a moment of individual brilliance . \" Roberto Galia stated in 2008 : \" I have played against Maradona , Platini and Baggio . But the player I saw do the most indescribable things was Michael Laudrup . \" Former teammate Guillermo Amor said : \" I have never seen a better player in one-on-ones . He was our special player . \" Thierry Henry named Laudrup as the best player he had never played with , saying he did not know any better passer than him and \" the world of football did not give him the credit that guy [ Laudrup ] deserved . \" John Toshack ranked Laudrup as \" the best player of his generation , \" likening him to Cruyff both as a player and a manager , a view shared by Franz Beckenbauer , who dubbed Laudrup the best player of the 90s . Javier Clemente once stated : \" To me , Michael Laudrup is the most genius player the world has ever seen . He will always be my numero uno . Always . \" José Mari Bakero instead remarked : \" No one has given the club [ Barcelona ] as much inspiration as Michael . We all look up to him . It is a privilege to have your day enriched by a genius . \" In 2012 , Ian Rush described him as \" an incredible player , \" who \" probably had the most individual skill \" he had ever seen . Daniel Storey of Planet Football stated in 2020 that he believed that Laudrup was one of the most underrated players of the previous 30 years , a view shared by Albert Ferrer , who stated in 2009 : \" Few people made me enjoy the game as much as Michael . Maybe he did n\\'t get the media recognition he deserved , but he was so classy and a real thinker . A master of the blind pass and impossible through-balls and I will never forget his \\'spoon \\' pass in a game against Osasuna . He lifted the ball right over the defence and Romario touched it in first time . \" At Barcelona , Laudrup played alongside Hristo Stoichkov , who scored many goals from Laudrup \\'s passes . Regarding Laudrup \\'s ability to create chances for his teammates , he commented in his 2008 autobiography : \" From more than hundred goals that I scored I \\'m sure that over 50 were assisted by Michael . To play with him was extremely easy . We found each other by intuition on the field and found common football language . Look at Ivan Zamorano . Laudrup went there ( Real ) and Zamorano is a goalscorer . Sometimes I envy Ivan for the passes he receives . Passes on foot after you accelerated . Few people understand football like the Danish player . He can only be compared with Maradona , Schuster or Roberto Baggio . They make things easy and find the right solutions . For them [ it ] is simple , for the opponent – unthinkable . Phenomenal ! His only problem is his character . He is emotional and terribly reserved . This affects him a lot , because he takes everything personally – no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree . His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he could n\\'t take the critics . I listen to him but I do n\\'t care that much . For Michael this was fatal . He could n\\'t take it anymore so he left without a word . \" That same year , in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine , Stoichkov included Laudrup in his \" Perfect XI , \" and labelled him as : \" One of the best European players I \\'ve ever seen , \" and as a player who was \" up there with the greats . \" He went on to describe him as : \" An elegant , old-fashioned playmaker , \" who \" did things few other footballers could do . \" In 2010 , he instead said that \" Laudrup was the greatest . \" Another striker who benefitted from Laudrup \\'s playmaking abilities was Real Madrid teammate Iván Zamorano , who called Laudrup \" El Genio \" ( \" The Genius , \" in Spanish ) during Laudrup \\'s time in the Spanish capital . Zamorano was going through a hard spell in Madrid , but when Laudrup arrived to assist his goals , Zamorano immediately became the top goalscorer of La Liga , winning the pichichi trophy ; Zamorano himself credited Laudrup for his role in his increased goalscoring output , describing him as a \" genius , \" while also commenting : \" ... The reason why I make so many goals is Laudrup . \" He also stated : \" Michael was a magician and one of the greatest players ever . He was amazing in one-on-ones too . I always say that Laudrup had three eyes , not two like everyone else . As a forward , I had to be aware all the time , because he could make you a chance out of nothing and you had to be prepared for that moment . \" Andrés Iniesta , who became known for using Laudrup \\'s signature dribbling move – the croqueta – rated Laudrup as the greatest player of all time . Throughout his career , his number of assists were almost always the highest of his team . However , despite his talent and reputation as one of the most technically gifted and creative players of his generation , certain players , pundits and managers have questioned Laudrup \\'s work rate , mentality , determination , and consistency throughout his career at times , in particular in his early career . His former Juventus teammate and admirer Michel Platini , for example , once said , \" [ Laudrup ] \\'s the greatest player in the world , in training , \" also describing him as \" one of the biggest talents ever , \" while also lamenting that he \" never used his talent to its fullest during matches . \" His former Barcelona manager Johan Cruyff described him as \" One of the most difficult players [ he had ] worked with , \" adding : \" When he gives 80–90 % he is still by far the best , but I want 100 % , and he rarely does that . \" In 1998 , he stated : \" Had Michael been born in a poor ghetto in Brazil or Argentina with the ball being his only way out of poverty he would today be recognised as the biggest genius of the game ever . He had all the abilities to reach it but lacked this ghetto-instinct , which could have driven him there . \" At Swansea in 2012 , Alan Tate commented : \" He is still the best player in training at [ age ] 48 years . \" This was echoed by Swansea player Danny Graham : \" Laudrup was the best player in training by a mile . It was unreal . \" In addition to his playing ability , Laudrup was known for his good conduct on the pitch and he never received a red card in his career . Managerial career Early years After his playing career ended with Ajax , Laudrup became a coach at age 36 when he started serving as an assistant coach for the Denmark national team head coach Morten Olsen in 2000 . The national team would play a 4–2–3–1 formation , depending on two fast wingers and with the aim to dominate games with a short-passing possession game . Together , they led Denmark to the knock-out stage of the 2002 World Cup . Brøndby After his success as Denmark assistant manager , Laudrup signed on as manager for Danish Superliga club Brøndby . As his assistant coach , he paired up with former Danish championship winning manager John Jensen , who had played alongside him in the Denmark national team . At the start of his reign , he proclaimed a tactical scheme close to that which Olsen and he had coached at the national team . He renovated the Brøndby team by letting a large contingent of older and experienced players leave , in favour of several new offensive players , and he also gave the chance to young talents from the club \\'s youth scheme . To ensure the defensive strength of the team , Laudrup signed proven national team player Morten Wieghorst . He began his reign as Brøndby manager by winning his first trophy in his managerial career , the 2002 Danish Supercup . In his first season as head coach , he guided the team to win the Danish Cup , after Brøndby beat Midtjylland 3–0 in the final and runners-up in the Danish Superliga . Laudrup \\'s success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year . In the following season , he again finished the season runners-up to first place Copenhagen by just one point . However , he would not be denied in the 2004–05 season , where he finally led the team to the Danish Superliga title . In the same season , he also completed The Double after he won his second Danish Cup in four seasons . This saw him being given his second Danish Manager of the Year award . After finishing runners-up in the 2005–06 Danish Superliga , Laudrup announced that he , along with assistant Faxe Jensen , could not come to an agreement for a one-year contract extension that was offered by the club . The pair , after winning four trophies in four seasons , subsequently left Brøndby in June 2006 . Laudrup was associated with several new jobs , including becoming manager of former club Real Madrid and that he would replace Lars Lagerbäck as head coach of the Sweden national team . In 2007 , Brøndby decided to name a new lounge at the stadium \" The Michael Laudrup Lounge \" , with Laudrup \\'s approval . His success led him to being voted and awarded the Danish Manager of the Year . Getafe On 21 June 2007 , Laudrup was linked to a move to Madrid-based La Liga club Getafe by sports newspaper Marca . This was confirmed on 9 July 2007 . During his stay in Getafe , the club reached the final of the Copa del Rey , losing to Valencia , and the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup , losing in extra time to Bayern Munich . During his tenure as successor to Bernd Schuster , he brought in a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to the club , bringing back memories of Laudrup as a player . His team , which was not one of the established powers in Spanish football , enjoyed comparative success . However , he performed only one season as manager , resigning in May 2008 . After Laudrup announced his departure from Getafe , he was linked with jobs at Barcelona , Valencia , Benfica , Chelsea , Blackburn Rovers , Panathinaikos , CSKA Moscow and West Ham United . He almost got the job at Panathinaikos , but according to Danish media , he wanted an option to allow him to leave if he received an offer from a Spanish club . This request was not accepted by the Greeks , who chose to hire Henk ten Cate instead . Spartak Moscow On 12 September 2008 , it was officially announced that Laudrup had signed a one-and-a-half-year contract to manage Spartak Moscow , replacing Stanislav Cherchesov following his dismissal after a string of poor results . However , Laudrup started on a poor note , winning just one of his first four league matches . He was subsequently sacked on 15 April 2009 , just seven months on the job , in the wake of Spartak \\'s quarter-final 3–0 loss to Dynamo Moscow in the Russian Cup . The official statement from Spartak read , \" From this point onwards , head coach Michael Laudrup has been relieved of his responsibilities because of unsatisfactory results . \" On 22 October 2009 , Spanish media announced Laudrup would be appointed as new manager of Spanish side Atlético Madrid , replacing the short and unsuccessful run of Abel Resino , following Atlético \\'s 4–0 UEFA Champions League group stage defeat to Chelsea . However , Laudrup and Atlético were not able to agree on terms and the deal fell apart . The day after , on 23 October , Resino was sacked and Quique Sánchez Flores was appointed as coach as the side \\'s second-choice . Mallorca In July 2010 , Laudrup was appointed manager of Mallorca on a contract lasting until the end of June 2012 . In his first season , he kept the struggling Mallorca side from relegation , which was suffering from losing many first team players and who was ejected from the UEFA Europa League due to its poor financial situation . At the beginning of the 2011–12 season , on 27 September 2011 , Laudrup resigned as manager following the firing of his assistant , Erik Larsen . Laudrup cited great frustration with Lorenzo Serra Ferrer , the club \\'s director of football , leading to a bad work climate as the main reason for his resignation . Swansea City On 15 June 2012 , Laudrup was appointed manager of Swansea City on a two-year contract , becoming the first Dane to manage in the Premier League . He made several new signings after arriving at Liberty Stadium , including Michu , Chico Flores , Pablo Hernández , Jonathan de Guzmán and Ki Sung-yueng . His first competitive match as Swansea manager came as an impressive 0–5 away win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers . At Swansea , Alan Tate said that Laudrup was considered to be the best player in training , despite being 48 years old . He has been commended for his choice of signings , most notably with Michu , who scored 22 goals in 2012 for Swansea after he signed him for a bargain €2.5 million from Rayo Vallecano . On 23 January 2013 , he led Swansea into their first ever major cup final after defeating reigning European champions Chelsea 2–0 on aggregate over two legs in the League Cup semi-finals . On 7 February 2013 , Laudrup appointed former Danish international midfielder Morten Wieghorst as his assistant after previously signing him as a player when Laudrup was managing Brøndby . Laudrup would later say he \" certainly \" believes Wieghorst \" can be manager \" of Swansea , as \" he has experience from Scottish football and is familiar with English football \" . On 24 February , Laudrup said he had no \" ambition to become the manager \" of a big club , because he could not \" have done everything for 10 years \" in management and then be fired \" after nine months \" for not winning any trophies . He also said it gave him \" much more pleasure to see how well \" he could do where he did not \" have to win all the time \" . On 24 February 2013 , Laudrup won his first trophy with Swansea after his side beat Bradford City 5–0 to win the Football League Cup at Wembley . This was also Swansea \\'s first major trophy in English football in the club \\'s history . Following Swansea \\'s 1–0 win over Newcastle United on 2 March 2013 the club moved into eighth position in the top-half of the Premier League table , seemingly safe from relegation with 40 points and ten games left ; Laudrup said he wanted Swansea to finish eighth , stating that \" coming eighth [ will be ] like winning the league \" for the club because he felt \" the first seven spots \" were already taken by Manchester United , Manchester City , Chelsea , Tottenham Hotspur , Arsenal , Liverpool and Everton . On 3 March , though he had said that his \" intention \" was \" to stay \" in south Wales for the next year , Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins said that the club were in the \" process of looking for the next manager \" of the club in case Laudrup did choose to leave the club . On 8 March 2013 , Laudrup signed a new contract with Swansea , keeping him at the club until 2015 . Reports indicated that he agreed to a contract with a release clause in the region of £5 million , much like the release clause Brendan Rodgers agreed to when he signed a contract extension at the Liberty Stadium four months prior to joining Liverpool . On 10 May , however , he confirmed that his \" intention \" was to stay at Swansea \" next season , \" saying that reports he wanted to leave Wales was \" pure speculation . \" On 4 February 2014 , Laudrup was sacked by Swansea following a poor run of form which left the club two points clear of relegation . At the time of the decision , the team had lost six out of their last eight league games . Lekhwiya On 30 June 2014 , Laudrup became the new manager of Qatar Stars League champions Lekhwiya after signing a one-year deal . He guided the Lekhwiya to a club-record Qatar Stars League and a Crown Prince Cup double in his first season . The club also qualified for the quarter-finals of the 2015 AFC Champions League during his reign . On 17 June 2015 , Laudrup announced that he would not extend his contract , departing the club . Al Rayyan On 3 October 2016 , Laudrup was unveiled as the new manager of Al Rayyan on a two-year contract , replacing Jorge Fossati . His first match in charge was on 15 October 2016 , when Al Rayyan faced Al Sailiya in an away match in the league , with the match ending in a 1–1 draw . Style of management and tactics As assistant manager to Morten Olsen , the Denmark national team employed a 4–2–3–1 system with pacey wingers playing the pivotal role in attack . Laudrup learnt from Olsen and used the same tactical style with Brøndby , with the team becoming more attacking and focused on a short passing style . He continued to employ a similar tactical style when he joined Getafe , ushering a new brand of exciting and free-flowing attacking football to help the club to the Copa del Rey final . However , at Spartak Moscow , he could not adapt his formation and tactics to the Russian game , with the club unable to score enough goals per match . As Mallorca manager , Laudrup inspired a team that lost a number of key players from relegation by playing an offensive game . In 2012 , he joined Swansea City as manager , replacing Brendan Rodgers . Under Rodgers , Swansea were known to play a 4–3–3 approach with a lot of focus on passing , where the full-backs pushed up when in possession and the outfield players played a high tempo pressing game . Under Laudrup , the team began employing a 4–2–3–1 formation , becoming more attacking while retaining the passing and pressing game . He also signed a number of new players , primarily from La Liga , trying to bring the attacking style from Spain to Wales , which saw more goals scored . He said , \" You can get a lot of quality for a reasonable amount in Spain right now . \" Laudrup earned plaudits for maintaining their flowing , attacking brand of football and attractive , passing style of play throughout the season , which saw his side win the League Cup , after beating Bradford City a record 5–0 in the final . \" You ca n\\'t ask players to do things that Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are doing , but you can ask the easy things , \" he said . \" Sometimes the easiest things in football , a simple pass five or eight yards , can be the most effective . That , everybody can learn . \" Outside of football Personal life Michael Laudrup is part of a family with three generations of footballers . His uncle was former Brøndby and Aberdeen manager Ebbe Skovdahl . He is the son of former Danish national team player Finn Laudrup . From his marriage with his first wife , Tina Thunø , Laudrup has a son , Mads . Mads has been the team captain of various Danish youth national teams since January 2005 . Today , he is married with Siw Retz Laudrup , with whom he has two children , Andreas and Rebecca . Andreas was selected a part of the under-16 national team in March 2006 . Michael Laudrup has a younger brother , Brian Laudrup , who was also a footballer . Brian Laudrup is the record holder of Danish player of the year awards with four , and was rated by FIFA as the fifth-best player in the world in 1992 . Brian Laudrup was in the Euro 92 Team of the Tournament and World Cup 98 Team of the Tournament . Brian was also known for his part in the Rangers squad which won nine consecutive titles in the 1990s . Brian was a part of the trophy-winning Danish national team at UEFA Euro 1992 , but Michael did not play in that championship due to differences with the national team coach Richard Møller Nielsen and because he thought that the barring of Yugoslavia for political , rather than football , reasons was not just . In 2004 , both the Laudrup brothers were named in the FIFA 100 , a list of the 125 greatest living footballers chosen by Pelé as part of the celebration of FIFA \\'s 100th anniversary . Politics and business Alongside his professional football career , Laudrup began importing Spanish wine to Denmark starting in 1993 . Initially , the wine import was sort of a hobby , but business grew rapidly and today his company Laudrup Vin og Gastronomi has over ten employees , runs a Wine Academy and imports wines from all over the world . In 2004 , Michael Laudrup was one of the founders of CEPOS , a Danish classical liberal/free-market conservative think-tank .

It is the largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe , and the second largest in the world , after Nike . It is the holding company for the Adidas Group , which consists of the Reebok sportswear company , 8.33 % of the German football club Bayern München , and Runtastic , an Austrian fitness technology company . Adidas \\' revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915 billion . The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother \\'s house ; he was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ( \" Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory \" ) . Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes ( spikes ) for multiple athletic events . To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear , he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber . Dassler persuaded U.S . sprinter Jesse Owens to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics . In 1949 , following a breakdown in the relationship between the brothers , Adolf created Adidas , and Rudolf established Puma , which became Adidas \\' business rival . The three stripes are Adidas \\' identity mark , having been used on the company \\'s clothing and shoe designs as a marketing aid . The branding , which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and two bottles of whiskey , became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as \" The three stripes company \" . History Early years : the \" Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik \" The company was founded by Adolf \" Adi \" Dassler who made sports shoes in his mother \\'s scullery or laundry room in Herzogenaurach , Germany after his return from World War I . In July 1924 , his older brother Rudolf joined the business , which became \" Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory \" ( ) . The electricity supply in Herzogenaurach was unreliable , so the brothers sometimes had to use pedal power from a stationary bicycle to run their equipment . Dassler assisted in the development of spiked running shoes ( spikes ) for multiple athletic events . To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear , he transitioned from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber . In 1936 , Dassler persuaded U.S . sprinter Jesse Owens to use his hand made spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics . Following Owens \\' four gold medals , the name and reputation of Dassler shoes became known to the world \\'s sportsmen and their trainers . Business was successful and the Dasslers were selling 200,000 pairs of shoes every year before World War II . Both Dassler brothers joined the NSDAP in May 1933 and became also members of the National Socialist Motor Corps . Furthermore , Adolf took the rank of Sportwart in the Hitler Youth from 1935 until the end of the war . During the war , the company was running the last sport shoe factory in the country and predominantly supplied the Wehrmacht with shoes . In 1943 the shoe production was forced to cease operations and the company \\'s facilities and workforce was used to manufacture anti-tank weapons . From 1942 to 1945 at least nine forced labourers were working at both sites of the company . The Dassler factory , used for production of anti-tank weapons during World War II , was nearly destroyed in 1945 by US forces , but was spared when Adolf Dassler \\'s wife convinced the American soldiers that the company and its employees were only interested in manufacturing sports shoes . American occupying forces subsequently became major buyers of the Dassler brothers \\' shoes . Split and rivalry with Puma The brothers split up in 1947 after relations between them had broken down , with Rudolf forming a new firm that he called Ruda – from Rudolf Dassler , later rebranded Puma , and Adolf forming a company formally registered as Adidas AG from Adi Dassler on 18 August 1949 . An urban myth has promulgated the backronym All Day I Dream About Sports . Puma SE and Adidas entered into a fierce and bitter business rivalry after the split . Indeed , the town of Herzogenaurach was divided on the issue , leading to the nickname \" the town of bent necks \" — people looked down to see which shoes strangers wore . Even the town \\'s two football clubs were divided : ASV Herzogenaurach club was supported by Adidas , while 1 FC Herzogenaurach endorsed Rudolf \\'s footwear . When handymen were called to Rudolf \\'s home , they would deliberately wear Adidas shoes . Rudolf would tell them to go to the basement and pick out a pair of free Pumas . The two brothers never reconciled and although they are now buried in the same cemetery , they are spaced as far apart as possible . In 1948 , the first football match after World War II , several members of the West German national football team wore Puma boots , including the scorer of West Germany \\'s first post-war goal , Herbert Burdenski . Four years later , at the 1952 Summer Olympics , 1500 metres runner Josy Barthel of Luxembourg won Puma \\'s first Olympic gold in Helsinki , Finland . At the 1960 Summer Olympics , Puma paid German sprinter Armin Hary to wear Pumas in the 100 meter sprint final . Hary had worn Adidas before and asked Adolf for payment , but Adidas rejected this request . The German won gold in Pumas , but then laced up Adidas for the medals ceremony , to the shock of the two Dassler brothers . Hary hoped to cash in from both , but Adi was so enraged he banned the Olympic champion . Corporate image In 1952 , following the 1952 Summer Olympics , Adidas acquired its signature 3-stripe logo from the Finnish athletic footwear brand Karhu Sports , for two bottles of whiskey and the equivalent of €1600 . The Trefoil logo was designed in 1971 and launched in 1972 , just in time for the 1972 Summer Olympics held in Munich . This logo lasted until 1997 , when the company introduced the \" three bars \" logo ( that had been designed by then Creative Director Peter Moore ) , initially used on the Equipment range of products . Tapie affair After a period of trouble following the death of Adolf Dassler \\'s son Horst Dassler in 1987 , the company was bought in 1990 by French industrialist Bernard Tapie , for ₣1.6 billion ( now €243.9 million ) , which Tapie borrowed . Tapie was at the time a famous specialist of rescuing bankrupt companies , an expertise on which he built his fortune . Tapie decided to move production offshore to Asia . He also hired Madonna for promotion . He sent , from Christchurch , New Zealand , a shoe sales representative to Germany and met Adolf Dassler \\'s descendants ( Amelia Randall Dassler and Bella Beck Dassler ) and was sent back with a few items to promote the company there . In 1992 , unable to pay the loan interest , Tapie mandated the Crédit Lyonnais bank to sell Adidas , and the bank subsequently converted the outstanding debt owed into equity of the enterprise , which was unusual as per the prevalent French banking practice . The state-owned bank had tried to get Tapie out of dire financial straits as a personal favour to Tapie , it is reported , because Tapie was Minister of Urban Affairs ( ministre de la Ville ) in the French government at the time . Robert Louis-Dreyfus , a friend of Bernard Tapie , became the new CEO of the company in 1994 . He was also the president of Olympique de Marseille , a team Tapie had owned until 1993 . Tapie filed for personal bankruptcy in 1994 . He was the object of several lawsuits , notably related to match fixing at the football club . During 1997 , he served 6 months of an 18-month prison sentence in La Santé prison in Paris . In February 2000 , Crédit Lyonnais sold Adidas to Louis-Dreyfus for a much higher amount of money than Tapie owed , 4.485 billion ( €683.514 million ) francs rather than 2.85 billion ( €434.479 million ) . They also purposely bankrupted Tapie \\'s company that owned Adidas , because only the company had the right to sue them . Post-Tapie era In 1994 , combined with FIFA Youth Group , SOS Children \\'s Villages became the main beneficiary . In 1997 , Adidas AG acquired the Salomon Group who specialized in ski wear , and its official corporate name was changed to Adidas-Salomon AG . With this acquisition Adidas also acquired the Taylormade Golf company and Maxfli , which allowed them to compete with Nike Golf . In 1998 , Adidas sued the NCAA over their rules limiting the size and number of commercial logos on team uniforms and team clothing . Adidas withdrew the suit , and the two groups established guidelines as to what three-stripe designs would be considered uses of the Adidas trademark . As CEO of Adidas , Louis-Dreyfus quadrupled revenue to €5.84 billion ( $ 7.5 billion ) from 1993 through 2000 . In 2000 , he announced he would resign the following year , due to illness . In 2003 , Adidas filed a lawsuit in a British court challenging Fitness World Trading \\'s use of a two-stripe motif similar to Adidas \\' three stripes . The court ruled that despite the simplicity of the mark , Fitness World \\'s use was infringing because the public could establish a link between that use and Adidas \\' mark . In September 2004 , top English fashion designer Stella McCartney launched a joint-venture line with Adidas , establishing a long-term partnership with the corporation . This line is a sports performance collection for women called \" Adidas by Stella McCartney \" , and it has been critically acclaimed . Also , on 3 May 2005 , Adidas told the public that they sold their partner company Salomon Group for €485 million to Amer Sports of Finland . In August 2005 , Adidas declared its intention to buy Reebok for $ 3.8 billion ( US $ ) . This takeover was completed with partnership in January 2006 and meant that the company had business sales closer to those of Nike in North America . The acquisition of Reebok also allowed Adidas to compete with Nike worldwide as the number two athletic shoemaker in the world . Adidas has global corporate headquarters in Germany , and many other business locations around the world such as Portland OR , Hong Kong , Toronto , Taiwan , England , Japan , Australia , and Spain . In 2005 , Adidas introduced the Adidas 1 , the first ever production shoe to use a microprocessor . Dubbed by the company \" The World \\'s First Intelligent Shoe \" , it features a microprocessor capable of performing 5 million calculations per second that automatically adjusts the shoe \\'s level of cushioning to suit its environment . The shoe requires a small , user-replaceable battery that lasts for approximately 100 hours of running . On 25 November 2005 , Adidas released a new version of the Adidas 1 with an increased range of cushioning , allowing the shoe to become softer or firmer , and a new motor with 153 percent more torque . On 11 April 2006 , Adidas announced an 11-year deal to become the official NBA clothing provider . The company has been making NBA , NBDL , and WNBA jerseys and products as well as team-coloured versions of the \" Superstar \" basketball shoe . This deal ( worth over $ 400 million ) took over the previous Reebok deal that had been put in place in 2001 for 10 years . In November 2011 , Adidas announced that it would acquire outdoor action sport performance brand Five Ten through a share purchase agreement . The total purchase price was US $ 25 million in cash at closing . By the end of 2012 , Adidas was reporting their highest revenues ever and Chief Executive Herbert Hainer expressed optimism for the year ahead . In January 2015 , Adidas launched the footwear industry \\'s first reservation mobile app . The Adidas Confirmed app allows consumers to get access to and reserve the brand \\'s limited edition sneakers by using geo targeting technology . On 24 March 2015 , Adidas and McDonald \\'s unveiled the 2015 McDonald \\'s All-American uniforms . For the third year in a row , players will be wearing short-sleeved jerseys , made with the same lightweight and breathable material as the ones used in the NBA . In August 2015 , Adidas acquired fitness technology firm Runtastic for approximately $ 240 million . In May 2017 Adidas sold TaylorMade golf company ( including Ashworth ) to KPS Capital Partners for $ 425 million . Products Apparel Adidas sells a range of clothing items , varying from men \\'s and women \\'s t-shirts , jackets , hoodies , pants and leggings . The first Adidas item of apparel was the Franz Beckenbauer tracksuit created in 1967 . Adidas AG is the largest manufacturer of sports bras in Europe , and the second largest manufacturer in the world . Sportswear Association football One of the main focuses of Adidas has always been football kits , and the associated equipment . Adidas remains a major company in the global supply of team kits for international association football teams and clubs . Adidas makes referee kits that are used in international competition and by many countries and leagues in the world . The company has been an innovator in the area of footwear for the sport , with notable examples including the 1979 release of the Copa Mundial moulded boot used for matches on firm dry pitches . It holds the accolade of the best selling boot of all time . The soft-ground equivalent was named World Cup and it too remains on the market . Since 1970 , FIFA , the world governing body of football , has commissioned specially designed footballs for use in its own World Cup tournaments . The Adidas Telstar was the first ball commissioned for the World Cup in 1970 . The balls supplied for the 2006 World Cup , the \" Teamgeist \" , were particularly noteworthy for their ability to travel further than previous types when struck , leading to longer range goals . Goalkeepers were generally believed to be less comfortable with the design of the ball , claiming it was prone to move significantly and unpredictably in flight . Adidas introduced the Jabulani for the 2010 World Cup . The ball was designed and developed by Loughborough University in conjunction with Bayern Munich . The Adidas Brazuca for the 2014 World Cup was the first World Cup ball named by the fans . Adidas is one of the official sponsors of the UEFA Champions League , and the Adidas Finale is the competition \\'s official match ball . Along with the aforementioned Adidas Predator boot , Adidas manufactures the adiPure range of football boots . Adidas named an official match ball of the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament the Adidas Beau Jeu which translates to \" The Beautiful Game \" in English .

Adidas Baseball hardgoods are licensed to Dick \\'s Sporting Goods . From 1997 to 2008 , Adidas sponsored New York Yankees . Basketball Adidas \\' Superstar and Pro Model shoes , affectionately known as \" shelltoes \" for their stylized hard rubber toe box , were fueled by , among others , coaches such as UCLA \\'s John Wooden . Adidas drew about even with Converse in basketball by the mid 1970s before both started to fall behind then-upstart Nike in the early 1980s . Subsequently , Adidas Superstar became very popular in the 1980s hip hop streetwear scene alongside Adidas \\' stripe-sided polyester suits . From 2006 to 2017 , Adidas was the uniform supplier of all the 30 teams in the National Basketball Association , replacing the Reebok brand after Adidas \\' acquisition of Reebok . Adidas was replaced by Nike as the official uniform supplier of the league after the 2016–17 season . Cricket Adidas began manufacturing cricket footwear in the mid 1970s , with their initial target market being Australia . Their shoes were a radical departure from traditional leather cricket boots which had remained basically unchanged for decades , being lighter and more flexible but also offering less toe protection , so that it became not uncommon to see batsmen who had been struck by the ball on the foot hopping around in pain . Having continued to manufacture cricket footwear for many years , in 2006 the company finally entered the field of bat manufacture in 2008 and currently their bat range includes the Pellara , Incurza , Libro and M-Blaster models . In the 1990s , Adidas signed the superstar Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar and made shoes for him . From 2008 until his retirement , Adidas had sponsored the cricket bat used by Tendulkar . It created a new bat , \\'Adidas MasterBlaster Elite \\' , personalized for him . In 2008 , Adidas made a concerted move into English cricket market by sponsoring English batting star Kevin Pietersen after the cancellation of his lifetime deal with Woodworm , when they ran into financial difficulties .

Skateboarding Adidas Skateboarding produces shoes made specifically for skateboarding , including the redesign of previous models for skateboarding . The brand also releases signature models designed by team riders . Tennis Adidas has been involved with tennis equipment since the mid 1960s and has historically sponsored many top tennis players , beginning with two of the most dominant male tennis players at the start of the professional era in the late 1960s , Stan Smith and Ilie Nastase . During the 1980s and 1990s , not only were they exclusive apparel and footwear sponsors of world number one men \\'s tennis players Ivan Lendl and Stefan Edberg and ladies \\' world number one Steffi Graf but each player had their own , exclusive graphic styles designed for their use during play , which were in turn marketed to the general public . Ivan Lendl even spent the vast majority of his dominant career playing with several different models of Adidas tennis racquets , primarily using the legendary Adidas GTX-Pro and then later the Adidas GTX Pro-T . The company recently introduced a new line of tennis racquets . While the Feather is made for the \" regular player \" , and the Response for the \" club player \" , Adidas targets the \" tournament player \" with the 12.2 oz Barricade tour model . Kabaddi Adidas entered Kabaddi which is still a non-Olympic sport but highly popular in the Indian subcontinent and Asian countries . In 2014 , with the launch of Pro Kabaddi League a city based franchise league in India , kabaddi took the region with storm . In 2015 , they tied up with Mumbai-based franchise U Mumba . \" The association of kabaddi with adidas is a clear exemplification of the growth of the sport over the last two years , \" shared U Sports CEO , Supratik Sen . Accessories Adidas also designs and makes slide-style sandals , mobile accessories , watches , eyewear , bags , baseball caps , and socks . As well , Adidas has a branded range of male and female deodorants , perfumes , aftershave and lotions . Adidas announced they would be launching a new $ 199 Fit Smart wristband in mid-August 2014 . The wristband will pair with Adidas \\' miCoach app , which acts as a personal trainer . Adilette Adilette was the first ever pair of sandals made by Adidas , originally developed in 1963 . Adidas claims that a group of athletes approached Adi Dassler requesting a shoe be made for the locker room . To this day , the resulting sandals are a best-seller . Since the original navy blue and white Adilette sandals were created nearly fifty years ago , more varieties have been created in different colours ( black , red , green , grey , orange , brown , yellow , pink , golden , silver ) . Most recently , Adidas has introduced a colour scheme that goes along with its Predator and adizero line ; the scheme is dubbed warning ( orange ) and purple . Usually , the three stripes appear in the contrasting colour on the strap of the classic models . The most common adilette livery is in navy blue or black , mixed with white colours . Also the Woodilette and Trefoil models follow a similar design but without stripes on the strap . The model provides a contoured orthopedic rubber sole with synthetic upper , and was designed as an après-sport slide , but the adilette were quickly adopted outside of the sporting world . Santiossage The Santiossage is a slide-style sandal . The sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe . Santiossage comes in black , navy , or red . On the side of the shoe , toward the heel on either side , the manufacturer \\'s name appears , as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the foot-bed . Notably , there are tiny clear massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging after-sport footaches , although the sandals are worn casually among non-athletes . Seen through these clear nubs are Adidas \\' three stripes . Adissage Adissage is also a slide sandal . Available in black , navy , light blue , black with pink , and other assorted colors , the sandal has the trademarked three stripes on a velcro strap toward the front of the shoe . On the side of the shoe , toward the heel on either side , the manufacturers name appears , as well as on a round emblem in the actual heel of the footbed . Like the Santiossage , there are tiny black massage nubs throughout the foot-bed for the purpose of massaging foot aches after sport , although popular as a casual sandal amongst non-athletes as well . Marketing During the mid to late 1990s , Adidas divided the brand into three main groups with each a separate focus : Adidas Performance was designed to maintain their devotion to the athlete ; Adidas Originals was designed to focus on the brand \\'s earlier designs which remained a popular life-style icon ; and Style Essentials , which dealt with the fashion market ; the main group within this being Y-3 ( which is a collaboration between Adidas and renowned Japanese fashion designer Yohji Yamamoto - the Y representing Yamamoto and the 3 representing the three stripes of Adidas ) . Launched in 2004 , \" Impossible is Nothing \" is one of the company \\'s most memorable campaigns . The campaign was developed by 180/TBWA based in Amsterdam , but significant work was also done by TBWA\\\\Chiat\\\\Day in San Francisco . A few years later , Adidas launched a basketball specific campaign -- \" Believe in 5ive \" —for the 2006-2007 NBA season . In 2011 , \" Adidas is all in \" became the global marketing strategy slogan for Adidas . The slogan aimed to tie all brands and labels together , presenting a unified image to consumers interested in sports , fashion , street , music and pop culture . There appears to be connection with the phrase \" all-in \" meaning \" exhausted \" in some English speaking nations . In 2015 , Adidas launched \" Creating the New \" as its strategic business plan until 2020 . Marketing in India India has been a very speculative market for Adidas . Despite this Dave Thomas , managing director of Adidas in India is ambitious of the country \\'s potential . The company hopes to double its revenue from Rs . 805 crores by 2020 . In 2015 , the company had signed Ranveer Singh a prominent Bollywood actor as a brand ambassador to the company \\'s products . Ranveer then was a budding actor . The company later decided to use the people \\'s almost religious adoration for the game cricket to promote their brand . It soon launched a new cricket campaign in the country . The campaign was called FeelLoveUseHate with prominent Indian cricketer Virat Kohli . However , in 2017 , Virat Kohli was removed as the brand ambassador of the company . The cricketer later signed a major deal with Puma India . The company also sells its products online through e-commerce websites such as Myntra , Snapdeal , Jabong and Amazon . Adidas also has a website dedicated to the Indian audience that markets and sells products to its consumers in India . Game advertisement The brand is featured in several games , including Daley Thompson \\'s Olympic Challenge ( Commodore Amiga ) , Adidas power soccer ( Sony PlayStation ) and Adidas Championship Football ( Commodore 64 , ZX spectrum , Amstrad CPC ) . Collaborations Adidas has done several collaborations with well known designers , including Jeremy Scott , Alexander Wang , and Raf Simons . They have also reached out to several celebrities , such as Beyoncé , Kanye West , Pharrell Williams , and Stan Smith to create some of the company \\'s most notable and coveted pieces . Sponsorship Adidas has numerous major kit deals with football clubs worldwide , including their main sponsor Bayern München . Moreover , their sponsored national teams include Germany , Spain , Mexico , Argentina , Sweden , Japan and Russia .

CEO ( 2002–2016 ) : Herbert Hainer Financial information Criticism Adidas \\' business practises/ethics and commitment to worker welfare have been scrutinised and often criticised . 2011 All Blacks replica rugby jersey pricing controversy Unhappy with the local price of the Adidas replica All Blacks jersey , New Zealand-based All Blacks fans have asked for price cuts and begun purchasing the jersey from overseas vendors after it was revealed that the local price of NZ $ 220 was more than twice the price offered on some websites . Adidas has responded by enforcing cross-border agreements to stop overseas retailers from selling to New Zealand residents .

The largest New Zealand sportswear retailer Rebel Sport has stated it is angry and is considering selling the All Blacks Jerseys to the general public below cost . 2012 \" shackle \" sneakers On 14 June 2012 , Adidas posted on their Facebook page a picture of a pair of Jeremy Scott-designed shoes containing shackles . The picture was of a planned shoe line that Adidas intended to release in July .

Jackson threatened a boycott , and NBA commissioner David Stern was at one point reportedly contacted in hopes that he would intervene . Shortly after the outcry , the company cancelled the product . Sweatshops and labour rights violations Adidas has been criticized for operating sweatshops , particularly in Indonesia . Between 2006 and 2007 , Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that supported unions in favour of subcontractors with worse labour rights records . By subcontracting work to different suppliers , it is more difficult for Adidas to ensure company labour standards are enforced . Adidas \\' policy includes the freedom for workers to take part in collective bargaining and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express concerns . In practice , however , many of Adidas \\' suppliers have not upheld these standards . At the Panarub factory in Java , 33 workers were fired after striking for better pay in 2005 . PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory where Adidas has been criticized over treatment of workers .

On 16 July 2012 , War on Want organised activists in London to replace Adidas price tags in sports stores with 34p ones , a reference to the low hourly wage rate paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods . The campaign group Labour Behind the Label claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers was only £10 a week . William Anderson , head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region , posted an entry on the company blog in which he claimed that total wages including bonuses and overtime were often double the hourly wage , and drew attention to purchasing power parity . In April 2014 , one of the biggest strikes on mainland China took place at the Yue Yuen Industrial Holdings Dongguan shoe factory , producing amongst others for Adidas . Soviet themed items , and advertising In 2018 , Adidas promoted a line of Soviet themed items . After a social media outcry , they were taken off the market .

Described by pundits and fellow professionals as one of his generation \\'s greatest players , Gerrard spent the majority of his playing career as a central midfielder for Liverpool and the England national team , captaining both . Born in Merseyside , Gerrard played for Liverpool from 1998 to 2015 , winning nine trophies , including the UEFA Champions League , two FA Cups , and three League Cups . He was Man of the Match in the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final , in which Liverpool overturned a 3–0 deficit to defeat AC Milan on penalties , and the 2006 FA Cup Final , which has been termed The Gerrard Final in homage to his performance . Despite success in cup competitions , he never won the Premier League . Gerrard won 114 England caps between 2000 and 2014 , captaining the team 38 times and scoring 21 goals . He played at three UEFA European Championships , in 2000 , 2004 and 2012 ( where he was named in the Team of the Tournament ) and three FIFA World Cups , in 2006 , 2010 and 2014 . Gerrard began his managerial career managing the Liverpool Youth Academy \\'s under-18 team . His senior managerial career began in 2018 with Scottish Premiership club Rangers . In his third full season in charge , Gerrard \\'s side went unbeaten in the league to win Rangers \\' first league title in 10 years . In November 2021 , he became the manager of Aston Villa . As a player , his individual awards include UEFA Club Footballer of the Year in 2005 , PFA Players \\' Player of the Year in 2006 , FWA Footballer of the Year in 2009 , appointment as a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 2007 , and induction into the Premier League Hall of Fame in 2021 . He was named in the PFA Premier League Team of the Year a record eight times . As a manager , he was named as Manager of the Year for 2021 by PFA Scotland and the SFWA . Early life Gerrard was born in Whiston , Merseyside , the second son of Paul and Julie Ann Gerrard . He started out playing for his hometown team , Whiston Juniors , where he was noticed by Liverpool scouts ; he joined the Liverpool Academy at age nine . His childhood footballing heroes were John Barnes and Ian Rush at Liverpool , and Paul Gascoigne for England . When Gerrard was young a garden fork was imbedded in the big toe of his right foot . In his autobiography , Gerrard : my autobiography , he credited Liverpool \\'s academy director Steve Heighway and his father for preventing an operation to amputate his toe . Although not a Catholic and living outside the catchment area , Gerrard attended Cardinal Heenan Catholic High School upon the recommendation of his primary school teacher , whose husband was a PE teacher there , due to its superior football reputation over other schools in the area . Gerrard had trials with various clubs at fourteen , but his success was not immediate ; Gerrard never made it into the England schoolboys \\' team . His trials included one with Manchester United , which he said in his 2006 autobiography was \" to pressure Liverpool into giving me a Youth Training Scheme contract . \" He signed his first professional contract with Liverpool on 5 November 1997 . Club career Liverpool 1998–2004 : Beginnings , cup treble and club captaincy Gerrard made his first-team debut for Liverpool on 29 November 1998 as a late substitute in a Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers . He made thirteen appearances in his debut season , replacing injured captain Jamie Redknapp in central midfield . He also occasionally played on the right wing , but scarcely contributed in the short match time he received , which he attributed to nerves . Gerrard recalled in a 2008 interview with The Guardian , \" I was out of position and out of my depth . \" Nonetheless , Liverpool \\'s coaching staff remained convinced that he would improve . Gerrard saw himself as a defensive player primarily , looking to make key tackles rather than push the team forward . Replacing Paul Ince , Gerrard regularly partnered Redknapp in midfield for the 1999–2000 season . After starting the Merseyside derby on the bench , he replaced Robbie Fowler in the second half , receiving his first career red card for a challenge to the upper leg of Everton \\'s Kevin Campbell . Later that season , Gerrard scored his first senior goal in a 4–1 victory over Sheffield Wednesday . However , he began to suffer from persistent back problems , which sports consultant Hans-Wilhelm Müller-Wohlfahrt later diagnosed as a result of accelerated growth , coupled with excessive playing , during his teenage years . He was then beset by groin injuries that required four separate operations . In the 2000–01 season , Gerrard made fifty starts in all competitions , scoring ten goals . That season , he won his first major honours with Liverpool—the FA Cup , Football League Cup , and the UEFA Cup—scoring in the final of the last competition . He was named PFA Young Player of the Year by his peers . The following season , he won the FA Charity Shield and UEFA Super Cup . In March 2003 , Gerrard scored the opening goal in the club \\'s 2–0 win over Manchester United in the Football League Cup Final , held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff . After a year as vice-captain , Gerrard replaced Sami Hyypiä as Liverpool captain in October 2003 . Manager Gérard Houllier said that he had recognised Gerrard \\'s leadership qualities early on , but that he needed time to mature . In June 2005 , Gerrard extended his contract at the club , signing a four-year deal . Houllier resigned as Liverpool manager after a trophy-less 2003–04 campaign , and Gerrard was linked with a move to Chelsea during the off-season . Gerrard admitted that he was not \" happy with the progress Liverpool has made \" , and that \" for the first time in my career I \\'ve thought about the possibility of moving on . \" Ultimately , Gerrard turned down a £20 million offer from Chelsea , staying with Liverpool under new coach Rafael Benítez . 2004–2007 : Champions League and FA Cup success Liverpool had many injuries early in the 2004–05 season , and a broken toe suffered in a September league match against Manchester United sidelined Gerrard until late November . On 8 December , Gerrard scored a crucial 25-yard half volley in the 86th minute of Liverpool \\'s final Champions League group stage match against Olympiacos to send the club through to the knockout round . A strike that saw Sky Sports co-commentator Andy Gray exclaim , \" Oh , you beauty ! ! What a hit son ! What a hit ! \" , Gerrard claimed that this was his most important , if not his best , goal for Liverpool to date . However , Gerrard netted an own goal during the 2005 League Cup final on 27 February , which proved decisive in Liverpool \\'s 3–2 loss to Chelsea after extra time at the Millennium Stadium . During a six-minute stretch in the second half of the 2005 Champions League final against AC Milan , Liverpool came back from a three-goal deficit to tie the match at 3–3 after extra time , with Gerrard scoring one of the goals , a header from a John Arne Riise cross . Liverpool \\'s third goal was gained as a penalty from a foul awarded to Liverpool when Gennaro Gattuso was judged to have pulled down Gerrard in Milan \\'s penalty area . Xabi Alonso \\'s penalty was saved by Dida but the rebound was scored . Gerrard did not participate in the penalty shoot-out ( he was the designated fifth penalty taker ) which Liverpool won 3–2 as they claimed their first Champions League trophy in twenty years . Dubbed the Miracle of Istanbul , the match is widely regarded as one of the greatest finals in the competition \\'s history , and Gerrard was lauded as the catalyst for the second half comeback . Gerrard was named the Man of the Match , and later received the UEFA Club Footballer of the Year award . In regards to his contract issues with Liverpool , Gerrard told the press after the final , \" How can I leave after a night like this ? \" but negotiations soon stalled and on 5 July 2005 , after Liverpool turned down another lucrative offer from Chelsea , Gerrard \\'s agent Struan Marshall informed Liverpool chief executive Rick Parry that Gerrard was rejecting a club-record £100,000-a-week offer . Parry conceded the club had lost Gerrard , saying , \" Now we have to move on . We have done our best , but he has made it clear he wants to go and I think it looks pretty final . \" The next day , Gerrard signed a new four-year deal as Parry blamed the earlier breakdown of talks on miscommunication between the two sides . Gerrard stated upon signing the contract that he would rather win one Premier League title with Liverpool than win multiple titles at Chelsea as it would mean more to him . Gerrard scored 23 goals in 53 appearances in 2005–06 , and in April became the first Liverpool player since John Barnes in 1988 to be voted the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year . He scored twice in the 2006 FA Cup Final against West Ham United , including an injury time 35-yard equalizer that sent the match into extra time , and Liverpool won their second consecutive major trophy on penalties . A match called The Gerrard Final , the goals made him the only player to have scored in the FA Cup , League Cup , UEFA Cup and Champions League finals . Liverpool eliminated Chelsea in the 2006–07 Champions League semi-finals on penalties , to return to their second final in three seasons , which they lost 2–1 to Milan in Athens . 2007–2012 : Continued success and stardom Gerrard suffered a toe fracture in an August 2007 Champions League qualifier against Toulouse , but returned four days later to play the entirety of a 1–1 league draw against Chelsea . On 28 October 2007 , Gerrard played his 400th game for Liverpool in a league match against Arsenal , in which he scored . He scored in all but one of Liverpool \\'s domestic and European matches during the month of November , and after scoring the only goal in a Champions League away tie against Marseille on 11 December , he became the first Liverpool player since John Aldridge in 1989 to score in seven consecutive games in all competitions . In December 2007 , Gerrard was voted sixth ( after Kaká , Lionel Messi , Cristiano Ronaldo , Didier Drogba and Ronaldinho ) for the 2007 FIFA World Player of the Year . Gerrard made his 300th Premier League appearance on 13 April 2008 in a match against Blackburn Rovers , scoring the opening goal in a game which Liverpool won 3–1 , and finished the season with twenty-one goals in all competitions , surpassing his total from the 2006–07 season . Gerrard was selected for the PFA Team of the Year and he was also one of the nominees or the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year , alongside teammate Fernando Torres . Gerrard needed to undergo groin surgery at the beginning of the 2008–09 season , but the problem was not serious and he quickly returned to training . He scored what appeared to be his hundredth career Liverpool goal against Stoke City on 20 September , but it was disallowed after Dirk Kuyt was ruled offside . He achieved the milestone eleven days later in a 3–1 Champions League group stage win over PSV . He made his 100th appearance in European club competition for Liverpool on 10 March 2009 against Real Madrid and scored twice in a 4–0 win . Four days after the victory over Real , Gerrard would score at Old Trafford for the first time from the penalty spot , putting Liverpool ahead on their way to a 4–1 victory over Manchester United . Following these results , three-time FIFA World Player of the Year Zinedine Zidane hailed Gerrard as possibly the best player in the world . On 22 March 2009 , Gerrard scored his first ever hat-trick in the Premier League , against Aston Villa , in a 5–0 victory . On 13 May 2009 , Gerrard was named as the 2009 Football Writers \\' Association Footballer of the Year , beating Ryan Giggs by just 10 votes and becoming the first Liverpool player to win the award in nineteen years . Gerrard was delighted and \" a little bit surprised \" to win the award . On 5 December 2009 , Gerrard made his 500th appearance for Liverpool at Blackburn . He ended the 2009–10 season with 12 goals and nine assists from 46 matches . Following the 2009–10 season , Rafael Benítez departed Liverpool after six years and was succeeded as manager by Roy Hodgson , who quickly assured fans that Gerrard would not be sold . To further eliminate any speculation surrounding his future at the club , Gerrard made a statement emphasizing his excitement at the coming season with Liverpool and praising the signing of Joe Cole . Gerrard soon played his first pre-season match of the 2010–11 season against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 1 August 2010 alongside new signing Joe Cole . Gerrard scored his first goal of the 2010–11 season from the penalty spot in a Europa League qualifier against Macedonian side FK Rabotnički on 5 August 2010 . His next two goals came on 19 September at Old Trafford in a 3–2 loss against Manchester United ; he scored from a penalty kick in the 64th minute and a free-kick six minutes later to level the game at 2–2 . He followed this up one week later with the second equaliser in a 2–2 home draw with Sunderland . Eleven days later , Gerrard came off the bench to score a second-half hat-trick in a 3–1 win over Napoli in the Europa League . Gerrard missed the start of the 2011–12 season due to a groin injury , which had also kept him out of action for large parts of the previous season . Gerrard later went on to reveal he rejected the chance to join Bayern Munich in the summer to focus on getting Liverpool back in the Champions League , saying \" ... a traditional club like Liverpool still has a value , that \\'s the reason why I have stuck around for so long ... it is more important to win a couple of trophies and achieve something that is a lot more difficult than go down the easy road and move to a club where it becomes easier . \" On 29 October , Gerrard underwent treatment to clear an infection in his right ankle , which was placed in a protective plaster cast . He was forced to miss Liverpool \\'s league match against West Bromwich Albion that day and was ruled out for at least the match against Swansea City the following week and England \\'s friendly matches against Sweden and Spain the week after that . On 30 December , Gerrard came off the bench against Newcastle United and scored a fine goal . Gerrard went on to help Liverpool to reach their first cup final in 6 years , and their first at Wembley Stadium in 18 years , as Liverpool beat Manchester City 3–2 on aggregate in the semi-finals . Gerrard scored a penalty in both legs to send Liverpool to the 2012 Football League Cup Final against Cardiff City on 26 February 2012 , which Liverpool won on penalties . On his 400th Premier League appearance for Liverpool , Gerrard scored a hat-trick to give Liverpool a 3–0 victory over rivals Everton in the Merseyside derby on 13 March . 2012–2015 : Final seasons with Liverpool On 18 August 2012 , Gerrard played his 250th match as Liverpool captain . He scored his first Premier League goal of the season on 23 September , opening the scoring in a 2–1 defeat against Manchester United . On 15 July 2013 , Gerrard signed a contract extension with Liverpool . On 3 August 2013 , Liverpool played Olympiacos , against whom Gerrard scored arguably his most celebrated goal , at Anfield for Gerrard \\'s charity fund-raising testimonial match . Liverpool won the match 2–0 , in a game where past players such as Jamie Carragher and Robbie Fowler made appearances . Alder Hey Children \\'s Charity , of which Gerrard is a founding partner , received £500,000 from the proceeds . On 5 October , Gerrard scored in a 3–1 win over Crystal Palace , becoming Liverpool \\'s first ever player to score in 15 successive league campaigns , overtaking the record previously set by Billy Liddell in 1959 . Also in October 2013 , he became the longest-serving Liverpool captain , 10 years after his appointment by Gérard Houllier on 15 October 2013 , breaking the previous record held by Alex Raisbeck , who captained Liverpool from 1899 to 1909 . On 19 October 2013 , Gerrard scored his 100th Premier League goal , a penalty against Newcastle United in a 2–2 draw . On 16 March 2014 , Gerrard scored two penalties and missed another in Liverpool \\'s 3–0 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford . With nine career goals against arch rivals Manchester United he is Liverpool ’ s highest goalscorer in the fixture . On 6 April , he scored another two penalties as Liverpool beat West Ham United 2–1 to go top of the Premier League table with five matches to play . These goals took him above Kenny Dalglish as Liverpool \\'s sixth-top goalscorer of all time . On 27 April , Gerrard was involved in what was later labelled as a defining moment of the 2013–14 Premier League season ; where Liverpool would ultimately finish second . Liverpool originally topped the league when they faced Chelsea in their third last match of the season . Gerrard slipped while receiving a pass which allowed Demba Ba to score the opening goal for Chelsea ; Chelsea went on to win 2–0 , which meant that Liverpool \\'s title hopes were no longer in their own hands . Gerrard finished the season with 13 goals and the League \\'s most assists at 13 . Gerrard was a nominee for the PFA Players \\' Player of the Year award that year , while he won the 2014 Liverpool Echo Sports Personality Award . Gerrard would later refer to this period as \" the worst three months of my life \" . In October 2014 , Gerrard ruled out retiring at the end of the 2014–15 season and said that he could join another club if he were not offered a new contract at Liverpool . On 1 January 2015 , Gerrard announced that he would leave Liverpool at the end of the season . Gerrard said he would have signed a new contract had it been offered in the offseason , but said the club did not make an offer until November . By that time , Brendan Rodgers had spoken to him about managing his playing time and he had been left out of the starting line-up against Real Madrid in the Champions League , contributing to his decision to leave Liverpool . His goal against Basel in the final group stage game of the Champions League was Gerrard \\'s 30th goal in the competition , a club record until it was surpassed by Mohamed Salah in 2021 . On 5 January 2015 , Gerrard scored two goals in his first game after announcing his departure in the FA Cup 3rd round tie in a 2–1 win at AFC Wimbledon . This followed another two-goal performance in the previous match against Leicester , the first time he scored two or more goals in consecutive games since July 2005 . On 4 February 2015 , he made his 700th appearance for Liverpool , in FA Cup tie against Bolton . On 22 March , Gerrard was sent off 38 seconds after coming on as a half-time substitute in a match against Manchester United for stamping on Ander Herrera . Gerrard made his 500th league appearance for Liverpool in a goalless draw against West Brom on 25 April ; he became only the third player ever to achieve 500 or more Premier League appearances for one club , after Ryan Giggs and former teammate Jamie Carragher . His final appearance for Liverpool at Anfield was on 16 May against Crystal Palace in a 3–1 loss . His final appearance for the club was eight days later in a 6–1 defeat at Stoke , with Gerrard scoring Liverpool \\'s only goal of the game . LA Galaxy 2015–2016 : Final years and retirement On 7 January 2015 , the LA Galaxy of Major League Soccer ( MLS ) announced the signing of Gerrard to an 18-month Designated Player contract , reportedly worth $ 9 million . He joined the team in July , following the end of the 2014–15 Premier League season . On 11 July , Gerrard made his debut for LA , coming on at half time for Ignacio Maganto in a 1–0 loss at Real Salt Lake in the U.S . Open Cup quarter-finals . He made his MLS debut on 17 July , scoring once , while assisting one goal of his former Liverpool teammate Robbie Keane \\'s hat-trick , during a 5–2 defeat of fellow Californians the San Jose Earthquakes at the StubHub Center . That month , Gerrard was one of the 22 players to be named to the 2015 MLS All-Star Game roster . He made 13 appearances across the regular season , scoring one more goal , the team \\'s last of a 3–2 home win over FC Dallas on 27 September . After the Galaxy were eliminated from the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs by Seattle Sounders FC , Gerrard announced that he may retire in 2016 , saying that he found unexpected difficulty in the long journeys to away matches in the United States , and the diverse altitude and weather across the country . Gerrard played his final game for the Galaxy on 6 November 2016 in a MLS Cup Playoff penalty shoot-out loss to Colorado Rapids . Gerrard took and scored Los Angeles \\' first spot-kick but the club were eliminated after Giovani dos Santos and Ashley Cole failed to convert . Nine days later , he stated he would be leaving on the expiration of his contract . He announced his retirement from professional football on 24 November , at age 36 . International career 2000–2004 : Beginnings and early call-ups Gerrard made his international debut against Ukraine on 31 May 2000 . That summer , he was called up for UEFA Euro 2000 , making only one appearance as a substitute in a 1–0 win over Germany before England were eliminated in the group stage . He scored his first international goal in the famous 5–1 victory over Germany in a 2002 World Cup qualifier in September 2001 , and while England qualified , Gerrard was forced to pull out of the squad due to his ongoing groin problems after pulling up in Liverpool \\'s final match of the season against Ipswich . 2004–2006 : Inaugural FIFA World Cup Before the Euros , Gerrard won the only trophy with the national team in his career – the friendly 2004 FA Summer Tournament . Gerrard scored his second goal for the national team in the Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia on 16 October 2002 in a 2–2 draw , his third goal was the opener in a 2–1 win over Serbia and Montenegro on 3 June 2003 . He was a regular starter in Euro 2004 , scoring once to make it 3–0 in England \\'s win over Switzerland in the second Group game of the tournament but England would be eliminated by the tournament hosts Portugal in the quarter-finals losing 6–5 on penalties in a match when Gerrard was substituted off in the 81st minute for Owen Hargreaves . He participated in his first World Cup in 2006 and scored two goals , both in the group stage , against Trinidad and Tobago and Sweden , although his spot-kick was one of three saved by goalkeeper Ricardo as England again bowed out to Portugal in the quarter-finals on penalties . He was England \\'s top scorer in the tournament . 2006–2010 : Vice-captaincy and \" Golden Generation \" Gerrard was made vice-captain of the England team by coach Steve McClaren , and while he filled in for John Terry as captain , England suffered back-to-back losses to Russia and Croatia that ended their Euro 2008 qualifying hopes . After new coach Fabio Capello took over the team in early 2008 , Gerrard was given a trial run as captain but Capello settled on Terry for the role . Gerrard was subsequently replaced as England vice-captain by Rio Ferdinand . Gerrard helped England qualify for the 2010 World Cup , scoring two goals in England \\'s 5–1 win over Croatia . John Terry was replaced by Rio Ferdinand as captain in 2010 , following revelations about the former \\'s private life , and Gerrard subsequently became vice-captain again . When the England team left for the 2010 World Cup , Gerrard was the most experienced player in the squad with 80 caps . During preparations for the 2010 FIFA World Cup , however , Rio Ferdinand was injured , meaning that Gerrard was appointed by Capello as captain for the tournament . After the tournament Gerrard , part of a group of England players dubbed the \" Golden Generation \" , confirmed that he would continue to be available for selection , despite suggestions from Capello that he would seek to rebuild the team . 2010–2014 : Captaincy and international retirement In August 2010 , Gerrard scored twice in a friendly match against Hungary and helped England to a 2–1 win . Due to Ferdinand \\'s continued absence through injury , Gerrard retained the captaincy for the opening match of the Euro 2012 qualifying campaign against Bulgaria , which England won 4–0 . He was later named permanent captain by new coach Roy Hodgson , in time for the tournament finals . This was the first time that he was named directly the captain of England and not in place of an injured or unavailable captain . He provided three assists and won two man of the match awards to help England finish top of their group in the qualifying round , and go through to the quarter-finals . Despite their exit on penalties to Italy , Gerrard was later the only England player to be named in the UEFA Team of the Tournament . On 14 November 2012 , Gerrard won his 100th cap for England in a friendly match against Sweden . For the 2014 FIFA World Cup , Gerrard captained England to their first group stage elimination since 1958 and their first elimination after only two matches , after two straight 1–2 defeats against Italy and Uruguay . Gerrard had played a part in both goals conceded against Uruguay courtesy of his club-mate , Luis Suárez . For England \\'s final game against Costa Rica , Gerrard was replaced as captain by Frank Lampard and used as a substitute . On 21 July 2014 , Gerrard announced his retirement from international football . He represented England 114 times ( currently the fourth most capped player ) , scoring 21 goals . Jordan Henderson described Gerrard as \" probably the best player this country has ever seen – not only as a player , but also as a leader and a captain . \" Style of play Regarded by several pundits and footballing figures as one of the greatest players of his generation , in 2009 , Zinedine Zidane and Pelé considered Gerrard to be possibly the best footballer in the world . Known for his versatility and wide range of skills , he was capable of playing in many positions . A hardworking box-to-box player with great endurance , Gerrard was usually deployed as a central midfielder , but he had also been used as a second striker , a holding midfielder , an attacking midfielder , a right-back , and a right winger . Gerrard began his professional career as a wide midfielder on the right , although he did not excel in this position as he had a tendency to commit careless fouls in his youth . Nevertheless , Liverpool retained their faith in the youngster , and he was later shifted to a defensive midfield position as he matured , where he excelled as a ball-winner rather than as a playmaker . He continued to evolve tactically , coming into his own in a box-to-box central midfield role , which allowed him to be effective both offensively and defensively ; indeed , at his peak , he was known for his ability to make late runs from behind into the penalty area . Under Benítez , he was also used in a supporting and creative role , as an attacking midfielder behind the strikers , or even as a deep-lying playmaker ; he was increasingly deployed in the latter position in his later career , in order to compensate for his physical decline , and due to his ability to dictate play in midfield with his vision and passing range . Gerrard , naturally right footed , was able to score goals from distance due to his ball striking ability—he scored many key goals from long range throughout his career , including in three Cup finals . As he entered his mid 30s and his physical capability to get forward and join the attack declined , the number of long range strikes at goal decreased , with most of his goals coming from free kicks and penalty kicks . In particular , his tactical intelligence and ability to read the game allowed him to break down the opposition \\'s attacking plays . In addition to his footballing attributes , Gerrard was highly regarded for his leadership , determination , and influence on the pitch throughout his career . Despite being vocal in his criticism of diving , Gerrard was accused of diving himself by certain pundits throughout his career . Managerial career In November 2016 , days before retiring as a player , Gerrard had an interview for the vacant managerial post at League One club Milton Keynes Dons , but said that he was not ready for the job . Liverpool Academy In January 2017 , he was appointed youth coach at Liverpool , effective from February . On 11 April , it was reported that Gerrard would be taking charge of the Liverpool Under-18 side ahead of the 2017–18 season after impressing Jürgen Klopp and Alex Inglethorpe with his work ethic , knowledge and attitude towards academy coaching . However , before he took the next step on the path to receive his coaching credentials , Gerrard pulled on the Liverpool shirt one last time in a friendly against Australian club Sydney FC at the end of this Premier League campaign . On 7 September 2017 , the club announced Gerrard would manage the Under-19 team in the 2017–18 UEFA Youth League . Rangers In late April 2018 , Gerrard entered talks to become the new manager of Scottish Premiership club Rangers . On 1 May , incumbent manager Graeme Murty was dismissed , with the club confirming three days later that Gerrard would succeed him from 1 June , ahead of the 2018–19 season , signing a four-year contract . He made his senior managerial debut on 12 July , when he led Rangers to a 2–0 UEFA Europa League win over Macedonian team Shkupi . Gerrard \\'s first game in charge in the domestic league was a 1–1 draw against Aberdeen , away from home . Under Gerrard \\'s management , Rangers went twelve matches unbeaten in all competitions from the start of the season before finally suffering defeat on 2 September , losing 1–0 to rivals Celtic in the Old Firm derby . On 29 December , in the reverse fixture , Gerrard guided Rangers to their first win over Celtic since 2012 , in a game that ended with a 1–0 scoreline . Ahead of the 2019–20 season , Gerrard was linked with a return to the Premier League , after the managerial position at Newcastle United became vacant . The move would have seen him replace his former Liverpool manager Rafael Benítez , who left the club at the end of his contract . Gerrard reportedly turned down the opportunity to take over as the club \\'s manager , because he was comfortable at Rangers . During the 2020–21 season , Gerrard led Rangers through a record-breaking season , claiming back-to-back derby wins over rivals Celtic , and topping their Europa League group . On 7 March 2021 , Rangers won the Scottish Premiership title without losing a single league match , achieving their first league title in 10 years and their 55th top-flight title overall . Aston Villa On 11 November 2021 , Gerrard was appointed as head coach at Premier League club Aston Villa on a three-and-a-half-year contract , succeeding Dean Smith , who was dismissed four days earlier . Villa paid Rangers compensation of around £4 million to release him from his contract . He led the club to a 2–0 home win against Brighton & Hove Albion in the Premier League in his first game in charge . Outside football Personal life Gerrard \\'s cousin , Anthony Gerrard , became a professional centre-back . He came through at Everton , where he did not make the first team , and spent most of his career in the Football League . The two faced each other in a professional match for the first time in the 2012 Football League Cup Final , when Steven \\'s Liverpool defeated Anthony \\'s Cardiff City in a penalty shoot-out in which both Gerrards missed . Gerrard and his wife , Alex Curran , married on 16 June 2007 , the same day as the weddings of his England teammates Gary Neville and Michael Carrick . The ceremony took place at Cliveden House Hotel in Taplow , Buckinghamshire . They have four children together . Councillors of Knowsley voted to make Gerrard a Freeman of the Borough on 13 December 2007 , and two weeks later , he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire ( MBE ) in the 2007 New Year Honours for services to sport . He received an honorary fellowship from Liverpool John Moores University on 26 July 2008 as recognition for his contribution to sport . In 2018 , Amazon produced a documentary called \" Make Us Dream \" detailing the life of Gerrard from a young boy up until his post as Liverpool youth coach . Autobiography In September 2006 , Gerrard published his first autobiography , Gerrard : My Autobiography , ghost-written by journalist Henry Winter , which went on to win the Sports Book of the Year honour at the British Book Awards . Gerrard \\'s second volume of autobiography , My Story , written with Donald McRae , was published in September 2015 . The autobiography ends with \" I play for Jon-Paul . \" Gerrard \\'s cousin , Jon-Paul Gilhooley , was killed in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster , when Gerrard was eight . Jon-Paul , who was 10 when he died , was the youngest of the 97 victims of the tragedy . \" It was difficult knowing one of your cousins had lost his life \" , Gerrard said . \" Seeing his family \\'s reaction drove me on to become the player I am today . Gerrard released a second book in 2012 , Steven Gerrard : My Liverpool Story . In his third and latest autobiography , 2015 \\'s My Story , he opined the four best players to have played alongside him are former Liverpool teammates Xabi Alonso , Fernando Torres and Luis Suárez and England teammate Wayne Rooney . Legal problems On 1 October 2007 , Gerrard was involved in a low-speed collision in Southport when the car he was driving hit a ten-year-old cyclist , who had shot into the street and inadvertently crossed Gerrard \\'s path . He later visited the boy in the hospital and presented him with a pair of boots signed by Wayne Rooney , the boy \\'s favourite player , after which he stayed to sign autographs for other young patients . On 29 December 2008 , Gerrard was taken into custody outside the Lounge Inn in Southport on suspicion of a section 20 assault . He and two other men were later charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm and affray , relating to an incident which left the bar \\'s disc jockey with a broken tooth and cuts to his forehead . The three were given police to court bail and were required to appear at North Sefton Magistrates \\' Court on 23 January 2009 , where they all pleaded not guilty . The case was adjourned until 20 March when the assault charge was dropped but Gerrard was required to attend Liverpool Crown Court to face trial for affray . On 3 April , Gerrard again pleaded not guilty . The case went to trial in Liverpool Crown Court . Gerrard \\'s co-defendants pleaded guilty before the trial but Gerrard maintained his innocence . Gerrard admitted hitting Marcus McGee but claimed it was in self-defence and on 24 July , Gerrard was found not guilty by the jury . Following the verdict , Gerrard said he was looking forward to getting back to playing football and putting the experience behind him . Entertainment In 2011 , Gerrard appeared in the film Will , about an orphaned young Liverpool fan who hitch-hikes to the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final . In August 2014 , Gerrard participated in the ALS Association \\'s Ice Bucket Challenge and went on to challenge Cardiff City winger , Craig Noone . Sponsorship Gerrard has had several different sponsorships in his career including current deals with Adidas , Jaguar Cars and Lucozade . In 2014 , Forbes listed his combined income from salaries , bonuses and off-field earnings at $ 17.2 million for the previous 12 months . While Gerrard has worn several football boots during his career , he first wore a pair of Nike boots on his Liverpool debut , but soon signed a deal with Adidas in 1998 and has gone on to appear in many Adidas commercials with the likes of Zinedine Zidane , David Beckham , Lionel Messi and Kaká . Gerrard has worn ten versions of the Adidas Predator boot , with the Accelerator being the first , and throughout his career , he has been one of the brand \\'s major boot endorsees . In 2013 , Gerrard switched boot silos to the Nitrocharge 1.0 first wearing the boots in the League Cup clash against rivals Manchester United on 25 September 2013 .

It is best known for the professional football team playing in the Primeira Liga , the top flight of Portuguese football . Founded on 28 September 1893 , Porto is one of the \" Big Three \" ( Portuguese : Os Três Grandes ) teams in Portugal – together with Lisbon-based rivals Benfica and Sporting CP , that have appeared in every season of the Primeira Liga since its establishment in 1934 . They are nicknamed Dragões ( Dragons ) , for the mythical creature atop the club \\'s crest , and Azuis e brancos ( Blue-and-whites ) , for the shirt colours . Those colours are in stripes with blue shorts . The club supporters are called Portistas . Since 2003 , Porto have played their home matches at the Estádio do Dragão , which replaced the previous 51-year-old ground , the Estádio das Antas . Porto is the second most decorated team in Portugal , with 79 major trophies , of which 72 were achieved in domestic competitions . These comprise 29 Primeira Liga titles ( five of which were won consecutively between 1994–95 and 1998–99 , a Portuguese football record ) , 17 Taça de Portugal , 4 Campeonato de Portugal , and a record 22 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira . Porto is the second team in Portuguese league history to have won two titles without any defeat , namely in the 2010–11 and 2012–13 seasons . In the former , Porto achieved the largest-ever difference of points between champion and runner-up in a three-points-per-win system ( 21 points ) , on their way to a second quadruple . In international competitions , Porto is the most decorated Portuguese team , with seven trophies . They won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1987 and 2004 , the UEFA Cup/Europa League in 2003 and 2011 , the UEFA Super Cup in 1987 , and the Intercontinental Cup in 1987 and 2004 . In addition , they were runners-up in the 1983–84 European Cup Winners \\' Cup , the 2003 , 2004 and 2011 editions of the UEFA Super Cup . Porto is the only Portuguese club to have won the UEFA Cup/Europa League , the UEFA Super Cup , the Intercontinental Cup , and to have achieved a continental treble of domestic league , domestic cup and European titles ( 2002–03 and 2010–11 ) . Porto have the third-most appearances in the UEFA Champions League group stage ( 23 ) , behind Barcelona and Real Madrid ( 24 ) . At the end of the 2018–19 season , Porto ranked 10th in the UEFA club coefficient ranking . History Early years ( 1893–1921 ) The club was founded on 28 September 1893 as Foot-Ball Club do Porto by António Nicolau de Almeida , a local port wine merchant and avid sportsman , who became fascinated with football during his trips to England . Porto played its first matches with other Portuguese clubs , including one against Lisbon \\'s Foot-Ball Club Lisbonense on 2 March 1894 . This match had the patronage of King Carlos I and Queen Amélie of Orléans , who travelled to Porto to witness the event and present a trophy to the winners . Almeida \\'s enthusiasm and involvement with the club waned due to family pressure , and by the turn of the century , Porto had entered a period of inactivity . In 1906 , José Monteiro da Costa returned to Porto after finishing his studies in England . Like Almeida , thirteen years before , he was also captivated by the English game , and together with some associates , decided to reintroduce the practice of football in the city , outside of the British circles . On 2 August 1906 , Porto was revived and Monteiro da Costa appointed its president . Although football was the driving force , the club also promoted other sports , including gymnastics , weightlifting and wrestling , athletics and swimming . Shortly after , Porto rented its first ground and recruited a French coach named Adolphe Cassaigne , who would stay in the club until 1925 . On 15 December 1907 , Porto played its first match against a foreign team , hosting Spain \\'s Real Fortuna . In the following month , Porto returned the visit and played its first match abroad . Four years later , the club won the inaugural staging of the Taça José Monteiro da Costa , securing its first-ever major title . In 1912 , Porto joined efforts with Leixões to establish the Porto Football Association , which began organising the regional championship in the following year . Porto finished the first season as runners-up , behind local rivals Boavista , but in the following season the club won its first championship . By the end of the 1920–21 season , Porto had been regional champions six times in seven years , and outright winners of the Taça José Monteiro da Costa , after claiming a third consecutive victory in 1916 . First national titles and drought years ( 1921–1977 ) The 1921–22 season was marked by the creation of the first nationwide football competition – the Campeonato de Portugal . Organised by the national federation , this knockout tournament gathered the winners of the regional championships to determine the Portuguese champion . After clinching its fourth consecutive regional title , Porto defeated Sporting CP in the inaugural edition and became the first national champions . While a dominant regional force , the club faced stronger opposition in the national championship , winning it only three more times in a span of sixteen years ( 1925 , 1932 and 1937 ) . In 1933–34 , Porto was denied participation in the Campeonato de Portugal by its football association for refusing to release players for a match between the Porto and Lisbon regional teams . In the following season , a second nationwide competition named \" Campeonato da Primeira Liga \" ( English : Premier League Championship ) , or simply Primeira Liga , was provisionally established by the national federation to increase the number of matches per season and improve the competitiveness of Portuguese football . As the regional champion , Porto qualified for the first edition of the new round-robin competition , winning it with 10 victories in 14 matches . Due to the success of its format , the Primeira Liga was made an official championship competition for the 1938–39 season – its name changed to \" Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão \" ( English : First Division National Championship ) or simply Primeira Divisão – and replaced the Campeonato de Portugal , which in turn was converted into the Taça de Portugal , the main domestic cup competition . Porto won the inaugural edition of the new league championship and successfully defended the title in the next season , despite almost failing to take part . The club failed to secure a third consecutive title , and after nearly missing again a place in the Primeira Divisão in 1941–42 , it would only return to a top-three finish in the 1946–47 season . In 1948 , Porto defeated English champions Arsenal 3–2 in a friendly match . To commemorate this victory , the associates offered the club a massive trophy made of of silver and wood – the Arsenal Cup . Having endured a 16-year title drought period , Porto returned to winning ways by taking the 1955–56 Primeira Divisão on head-to-head advantage over runners-up Benfica . Later that season , Porto beat Torreense to win its first Taça de Portugal and achieved its first double . As the Portuguese league winner , Porto made its debut in European competitions by qualifying for the 1956–57 European Cup . The club \\'s first participation was short-lived , ending in the preliminary round with two defeats against Spanish champions Athletic Bilbao . A year later , Porto lifted its second Taça de Portugal by beating Benfica 1–0 in the final . In 1958 , Béla Guttmann took charge as coach of Porto and helped them overhaul a five-point lead enjoyed by Benfica to win the Portuguese League title in 1959 . The two clubs met in the season \\'s final , but this time Benfica took the trophy and denied a second double for Porto that had won the 1958–59 Primeira Divisão three months before . Shortly after , the club entered another lacklustre period of its history , the highest point of which was a victory in the 1968 Taça de Portugal final . During this time , Porto had its worst-ever league classification , a ninth place in 1969–70 , while its best league record in that period consisted of six runner-up finishes ( four consecutive between 1961–62 and 1964–65 ) . In European competitions , the club participated for the first time in the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup ( and its successor , the UEFA Cup ) and in the Cup Winners \\' Cup , without getting past the third round . One of the club \\'s most tragic moments occurred on 16 December 1973 , when during a league match against Vitória de Setúbal , the 26-year-old captain Pavão fell unconscious on the pitch and died later at the hospital . The following month , Porto presented Peruvian international Teófilo Cubillas , who became one of the club \\'s most successful players , scoring 65 goals in 108 games . International affirmation ( 1977–1988 ) The return of José Maria Pedroto – a former Porto player and head coach in the late 1960s – in the 1976–77 season started a new chapter in the club \\'s history . Responsible for the previous cup triumph in 1968 , Pedroto guided Porto to its fourth title in the competition . In the following season , he put an end to Porto \\'s league title drought , winning the championship 19 years after having played in the team that took the last title . Internationally , Porto reached the quarter-finals of the 1977–78 Cup Winners \\' Cup , beating Manchester United along the way , but suffered its heaviest defeat ( 6–1 ) against AEK Athens in the subsequent season \\'s European Cup . A poor run of performances in the latter part of the season – resulting in the loss of the league and cup titles – sparked a conflict between the technical staff and president Américo de Sá , which ended with the resignation of Pedroto and his replacement by Hermann Stessl . In December 1981 , Porto overcame Benfica to win the inaugural staging of the Portuguese Super Cup , the Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira . Pedroto returned in April 1982 by the hand of the club \\'s newly elected president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa , who had resigned as director of football , two years before , in solidarity with the coach . The previous month , Porto fell again in the Cup Winners \\' Cup quarter-finals against one of the eventual finalists , but needed only two years to finally reach the competition \\'s final . On 16 May 1984 , Porto played its first major European final in Basel \\'s St . Jakob Stadium , losing 2–1 to Michel Platini \\'s Juventus . Already without Pedroto , who stepped down due to illness , Porto won that season \\'s Taça and Supertaça but lost the championship to Benfica . Under the steering of Pedroto \\'s apprentice , Artur Jorge , the following season brought the Primeira Divisão title back to the club and crowned homegrown striker Fernando Gomes as Europe \\'s top goalscorer for the second time , after first taking the award in 1983 . Porto retained the league title in 1986 , securing an entry to the 1986–87 European Cup . In the first game , the club recorded its biggest win in European competitions : 9–0 against Maltese side Rabat Ajax . Vítkovice of Czechoslovakia , Brøndby of Denmark , and Dynamo Kyiv of the Soviet Union were successively eliminated as Porto advanced to its first European Cup final , against Bayern Munich . Trailing the Germans 1–0 until the 79th minute , Porto scored twice in two minutes – the first goal through a famous backheel from former Algerian international Rabah Madjer , who assisted Juary for the second – to secure a surprising win and the European Cup title . The following season , under new coach Tomislav Ivic , the club completed a treble of international trophies by beating Ajax for the 1987 European Super Cup and Uruguay \\'s Peñarol for the 1987 Intercontinental Cup . The 1987–88 season was one of the most successful for the club , who also won the Taça de Portugal and an expanded 20-team Primeira Divisão with a record number of goals scored ( 88 ) and distance in points to the runners-up ( 15 ) . Tri , Tetra , Penta ( 1988–2001 ) In contrast to the previous season , Porto failed to win a trophy in 1988–89 , with many of its players struck down with injuries , such as Madjer and Gomes . Fifteen years after his first-team debut , Gomes made his last season for Porto , where he became the all-time top goalscorer with 352 goals in 455 matches . The club brought back Artur Jorge , who recovered the Primeira Divisão title in the following season and added the Taça and Supertaça trophies in 1991 . His successor , Brazilian Carlos Alberto Silva , won back-to-back league titles in two seasons and qualified Porto for the first UEFA Champions League . Midway through the 1993–94 season , Porto hired former England manager Bobby Robson , who had been sacked by Sporting CP . The club closed the gap to league winners Benfica , reached the 1993–94 UEFA Champions League semi-finals , and ended the season with a victory over Sporting CP in the Taça de Portugal final . In Robson \\'s first full season , Porto claimed the 1994–95 Primeira Divisão title with a win at Sporting CP \\'s ground and played Benfica four times to secure both the 1993 and 1994 stagings of the Supertaça . The beginning of the season had been clouded by the death of 26-year-old midfielder Rui Filipe , who had scored the club \\'s first league goal . Robson \\'s increasing health problems barred him from leading Porto in the first months of the 1995–96 season , but he returned in time to revalidate the league title . Striker Domingos Paciência became the club \\'s top goalscorer for the second consecutive time and won that season \\'s Bola de Prata , the last win by a Portuguese player . To fill the void left by the departure of Robson for Barcelona , Porto hired former club captain and Portugal national team manager António Oliveira . Under his command , Porto made history by winning a third consecutive league title ( the Tri ) for the first time , leaving the runners-up at a distance of 13 points . The club \\'s eighth Supertaça win over Benfica was achieved with a solid performance at the Estádio da Luz that resulted in a 5–0 scoreline . The arrival of Brazilian players Artur and Mário Jardel proved highly productive in the 1996–97 UEFA Champions League , as their goals helped Porto beat Milan in Italy and win its group without defeats . In addition , Jardel would win the first of four consecutive Bola de Prata awards while at Porto . In Oliveira \\'s second and last season at the club , Porto won the Primeira Divisão for the fourth straight season ( the Tetra ) , matching Sporting CP \\'s achievement in the early 1950s , and secured its third double after beating Braga in the 1998 Taça de Portugal final . For the 1998–99 season , Porto tasked Portuguese coach Fernando Santos with winning the club \\'s fifth successive Primeira Divisão title ( the Penta ) – a Portuguese football record . He accomplished this feat , becoming thereafter known as the \" Penta engineer \" ( a pun to his academic degree ) , and saw Jardel \\'s 36 goals win him the European Golden Shoe . Porto lost the chance to win its sixth straight league title , after finishing four points behind 1999–2000 Primeira Liga champions Sporting , but overcame them to lift its tenth Taça de Portugal trophy . Despite winning the Portuguese cup for the second time in two years , continued failure to retake the league title led to the resignation of Santos at the end of the 2000–01 season . Mourinho \\'s golden years ( 2001–2004 ) The appointment of former club player and assistant coach Octávio Machado to head Porto back to the league title appeared to pay off as the team began the season with a Supertaça win against the 2000–01 Primeira Liga winners , Boavista . However , this would be the only major achievement in a lacklustre season that would culminate with a third place in the league classification – the lowest in 20 years . The elimination from the 2001–02 Taça de Portugal , four days after losing away for the Primeira Liga , precipitated the sacking of Machado after 36 matches in charge . Two days later , Porto signed União de Leiria \\'s coach , José Mourinho , who had previously worked for the club alongside Robson . In his presentation , Mourinho promptly showcased his personality by stating unequivocally that the club would win next season \\'s league title . He kept true to his promise and delivered one of the club \\'s most successful seasons . Fielding the likes of Deco , Ricardo Carvalho , Maniche , and less known players hired from other Portuguese clubs , such as Paulo Ferreira , Pedro Emanuel , Nuno Valente and Derlei , Porto won the 2002–03 Primeira Liga with relative comfort , finishing 11 points ahead of second-placed Benfica . The club also won the UEFA Cup , defeating Celtic in a dramatic extra-time final , to win its second major European title . Mourinho then secured an unprecedented treble for Porto by winning the Taça de Portugal final against his previous club . The 2003–04 season began with another 1–0 win over União de Leiria , which gave the club its 13th Supertaça . Weeks later , Porto failed to repeat this success in the 2003 UEFA Super Cup , losing 1–0 to Milan . The departure of striker Hélder Postiga was compensated by the signing of South Africa \\'s Benni McCarthy , whose 20 league goals helped Porto in its league title defense and crowned him the competition \\'s top scorer . Porto entered the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League directly into the group stage . Porto finished second in its group , losing only once to Real Madrid , and advanced to the round-of-16 where they met Manchester United . After narrowly winning at home ( 2-1 ) , Porto was on the verge of elimination , being behind by 1-0 till the last minute of official playtime at the second leg at Old Trafford . However , Porto scored the equalizer in the 90th minute of the second leg to draw 1–1 and to advance to the quarter-finals with a 3–2 aggregate win . The team then overcame Lyon and Deportivo La Coruña to reach the Champions League final . Porto defeated Monaco 3–0 to lift the club \\'s second European Champion Clubs \\' Cup . A 2–1 loss to Benfica in the Taça de Portugal final , held 10 days before , prevented another treble-winning season . Life after Mourinho ( 2004–2010 ) The successful European performances of Mourinho \\'s Porto enhanced the reputations of the coach and players like Carvalho , Ferreira and Deco , all of whom left the club in the aftermath of the Champions League victory . The following season was an atypical one , as the club had three coaches : Luigi Delneri , Víctor Fernández and José Couceiro . Under Férnandez , Porto won the 2004 Supertaça Cândido de Oliveira and the 2004 Intercontinental Cup , but lost the 2004 UEFA Super Cup to Valencia and was eliminated prematurely in the 2004–05 Taça de Portugal . Recording only 17 wins in 34 matches , Porto lost the Primeira Liga title to Benfica by three points . During this period , Porto was directly involved in the corruption scandal Apito Dourado . In 2005–06 , Dutch coach Co Adriaanse was picked to reorganise the team and return the club to the top of Portuguese football . His tactical discipline and the contribution of new signings Lucho González and Lisandro López led the club to not only retake the Primeira Liga title but also secure its fifth domestic double , after beating holders Vitória de Setúbal in the Taça de Portugal final . Adriaanse \\'s domestic success did not transfer to the Champions League , as Porto finished in the bottom of its group . The club began the 2006–07 season with a new coach , Jesualdo Ferreira , signed from neighbours Boavista . Before Ferreira assumed his role , Porto won the season-opening Supertaça , with former club player Rui Barros acting as interim coach . An experienced head coach , Ferreira had never achieved major club level success , but in his first season in Porto he became national champion for the first time . The 2006–07 Primeira Liga title was only secured in a frantic final day , as Porto finished one point above Sporting and two above Benfica . In the following season , the club achieved the Tri for the second time in its history – with López clinching the top goalscorer award – , but lost the Taça and Supertaça finals to Sporting CP . As result of a legal investigation on match fixing in Portuguese football , Porto was punished with the loss of six points , which did not affect its final league classification . Having claimed a sixth league and cup double in the 2008–09 season , Porto was on course to emulate the Penta of the late 1990s , but the series was broken by Benfica in the following season . Although Ferreira won his first Supertaça and defended the Taça de Portugal title , the team \\'s failure to claim a fifth consecutive league – finishing third , outside the Champions League-qualifying places – and a 3–0 defeat against Benfica in the final of the Taça da Liga contributed to his resignation at the end of the season . A home win against Benfica prevented the rivals from celebrating the league title at the Estádio do Dragão . Under Ferreira \\'s steering , Porto always qualified for the Champions League knockout stage , reaching the quarter-finals in 2008–09 , where it was eliminated by holders Manchester United . Villas-Boas , Pereira and subsequent years ( 2010–2017 ) The arrival of Mourinho \\'s former assistant André Villas-Boas , in the spring of 2010 , set the stage for a highly successful 2010–11 season , which began with a 2–0 victory over Benfica for the Supertaça . Spearheaded by João Moutinho , Silvestre Varela , Falcao and Hulk ( the Bola de Prata winner ) , Porto performed strongly in the Primeira Liga and assured its 25th title with five matches to play , after beating Benfica in its stadium . In addition , the club broke a number of records : biggest distance between champions and runners-up ( 21 points ) , the most consecutive league wins ( 16 ) , and the highest percentage of points in a 30-game season ( 93.33 % ) , dropping only six points and finishing the league without defeats , for the first time in its history . Eight years after the 2003 triumph , Porto returned to the UEFA Cup ( renamed UEFA Europa League ) and reached the final in Dublin \\'s Aviva Stadium . In an all-Portuguese affair , Porto beat Braga with a goal from the competition \\'s top goalscorer Falcao and lifted the trophy for the second time , as Villas-Boas became the youngest UEFA competition-winning coach . Four days later , Porto won its third consecutive Taça de Portugal with a convincing 6–2 scoreline , securing their fourth trophy of the season . As Villas-Boas left for Chelsea , Porto recruited the services of his assistant , Vítor Pereira . For the third straight year , the club began the season with another Supertaça title , which was followed by a 2–0 loss to Barcelona for the 2011 UEFA Super Cup . Although lacking the goalscoring prolificacy of Falcao ( sold to Atlético Madrid ) , Porto was able to revalidate the Primeira Liga title , but was eliminated prematurely from the Taça and Champions League competitions . Transferred to the Europa League , Porto failed to defend its title after being knocked out by Manchester City . In the following season , the club went a stage further in both domestic cup competitions and in the Champions League , where it fell to Málaga in the last-16 round . In the 2012–13 Primeira Liga , Porto reduced the distance to leaders Benfica to two points , before hosting them in the penultimate matchday . In a dramatic turn of events , Porto won with a goal in stoppage time and moved to the top of the league table . An away victory in the last game confirmed the Tri and Porto \\'s 27th league title – the second without defeats . Porto entered the 2013–14 season with a new head coach – Paulo Fonseca , signed from 2012–13 Primeira Liga third-placed Paços de Ferreira – but continued the trend of the previous four seasons by winning the Supertaça . This title would be the highlight of the season , as the club underperformed in every other competition it was involved . In the league , Porto led with five points over its pursuers , but a series of compromising results pushed the club down to third place , resulting in the sacking of Fonseca . Failing to overcome the Champions League group stage , Porto reached the Europa League quarter-finals , where they lost 4–1 to the eventual winners Sevilla . In the following weeks , two semi-final losses against Benfica closed the doors to the finals of the Taça de Portugal and Taça da Liga , the latter at home on penalties . Porto started the 2014–15 season with their biggest budget ever , hiring Spanish head coach Julen Lopetegui . Despite the signing of many new players , they failed to win any silverware , contributing to the biggest hiatus during Pinto da Costa \\'s presidency . They also equalized , in terms of goals conceded , their biggest defeat in European competitions ( 6–1 against AEK Athens ) and suffered their biggest defeat in the UEFA Champions League ( 6–1 against Bayern Munich , after the 5–0 loss against Arsenal in 2010 ) . Porto continued their losing trend in the 2015–16 season , making it the second consecutive trophyless season , with the contribution of José Peseiro , who had replaced Julen Lopetegui in January 2016 . After the season was over , Peseiro was replaced by Nuno Espírito Santo . Conceição era ( 2017–present ) In the 2017–18 season , after almost five years without winning any trophy , Porto won their 28th league title with the contribution of coach Sérgio Conceição ( former club player ) . The following year , in the 2018–19 UEFA Champions League , Porto managed to reach the quarter-finals of the competition , but were defeated by 6–1 on aggregate against the eventual winners Liverpool . In the 2019–20 season , Porto managed to recapture the league title , winning it for the 29th time and added for the first time in eleven years the Portuguese cup along with it . However , despite their national success , FC Porto did not reach the group phase of the Champions League and did poorly in their Europa League campaign . In the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League round of 16 , Porto won on away goals rule ( 4–4 on aggregate ) against Juventus , to reach the quarter-finals . Crest and kit The club \\'s first crest was created in 1910 and consisted of an old blue football with white seams bearing the club name \\'s initials in white . On 26 October 1922 , the crest was changed to its present-day appearance after the club approved a design by Augusto Baptista Ferreira ( nicknamed \" Simplício \" ) , a graphical artist and one of the club \\'s players . In his proposal , the city \\'s coat of arms – consisting at the time of a quartered shield ( first and fourth quadrants : national arms ; second and third quadrants : image of Our Lady holding baby Jesus and flanked by two towers holding above a banner with the Latin words \" Civitas Virginis \" ) surrounded by the collar of the Order of the Tower and Sword and topped by a crown supporting a green dragon with a red banner inscribed with \" Invicta \" ( Undefeated [ city ] ) – was added on top of the old crest , pushing the white letters down . In 1906 , the club \\'s first official team wore kits with a variety of colors and patterns , which included white shirts with red collars or vertical blue stripes , and even red shirts . This indefinition in the equipment was only solved in 1909 , when through the initiative of Monteiro da Costa , Porto stipulated in its first statutes that the players had to use \" a shirt with blue vertical stripes , black shorts , and personal footwear \" as the club \\'s uniform , at every training and match . Some argued that the kit should have included the city colours , green and white . Monteiro da Costa , however , defended the blue-and-white combination because he believed the colors \" should be those of the country \\'s flag , and not of the city \\'s flag \" , hoping that the club would \" not only defend the good name of the city , but also that of Portugal , in sporting feuds against foreigners . \" In 1975 , Adidas became the first sports apparel manufacturers to provide kits for the club . Eight years later , Porto became the first Portuguese team to have a shirt sponsor , after signing a deal with Revigrés worth 10 million escudos per year . This deal lasted for 20 years , with successive renovations , after which the national communications corporation Portugal Telecom ( PT ) became the new shirt sponsors . Still , Revigrés remain as one of the club \\'s main and longest-serving collaborators . Home stadiums The club \\'s first ground was the Campo da Rainha ( Queen \\'s Field ) , inaugurated in 1906 with an exhibition game against Boavista . The site was located near the residence of Monteiro da Costa and was the property of the city \\'s horticultural society . Aided by his father , a horticultor by profession , Monteiro da Costa rented a portion ( 30 by 50 meters ) of uncultivated terrain to create the first dedicated football pitch in the country . Later that year , the society \\'s vivaria were transferred to another location , allowing Porto to increase the pitch area to match the sport \\'s official dimensions . The ground had capacity for 600 people , including a VIP tribune , and possessed a changing room equipped with showers and sinks , a bar and a gym . The first match between Porto and a foreign team took place at the Campo da Raínha , on 15 December 1907 , when the hosts played Spanish side Real Fortuna . By 1911 , the Campo da Raínha was becoming too small for the growing attendances . After being notified about the sale of the ground for construction of a factory , the club searched for a new ground and rented a terrain near the Constituição street for an annual fee of 350 $ 00 . The Campo da Constituição ( Constitution Field ) was opened in January 1913 with a match against Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club and hosted Porto \\'s home matches for the regional championship . Eventually , the larger capacity of this ground also became insufficient for the ever-increasing crowds attending the games , particularly against high-profile opponents . On several occasions , between the 1920s and 1940s , Porto played host to matches at the Campo do Ameal ( Ameal Field ) or the Estádio do Lima ( Lima Stadium ) , home of local rivals Sport Progresso and Académico , respectively . It was in the latter ground that the club achieved their most important victory at the time , as they beat English champions Arsenal 3–2 in a friendly match on 7 May 1948 . In 1933 , Porto approved a plan to build a new stadium to accommodate and meet the demands of larger attendances , but the project only moved forward with the purchase of of land in the eastern side of the city in 1947 . Designed by Portuguese architects Oldemiro Carneiro and Aires de Sá , the construction of the Estádio do Futebol Clube do Porto – better known as Estádio das Antas ( Antas Stadium ) for the neighbourhood where it was built – began in January 1950 , one month after the first stone was symbolically laid . Two years later , on 28 May 1952 , the stadium was inaugurated with a ceremony , featuring the presence of the President of the Republic Francisco Craveiro Lopes , and a match against Benfica , which Porto lost 2–8 . The stadium \\'s initial layout had an open east sector ( Marathon Door ) , which was closed in 1976 with the construction of a two-tier stand that raised the capacity to 70,000 . In 1986 , works to lower the pitch and build an additional tier in the place of the athletics and cycling track were concluded , setting the capacity to a new maximum of 95,000 . As stadium safety regulations became stricter during the following decade , the placing of individual seats brought the capacity of the Estádio das Antas down to 55,000 by 1997 . The awarding of the UEFA Euro 2004 hosting rights to Portugal in 1999 was the perfect opportunity for Porto to move into a more modern , functional and comfortable stadium , in line with the demands of high-level international football . The club decided to build an entirely new ground and chose a site located a few hundreds of meters southeast of the Estádio das Antas . The project was commissioned to Portuguese architect Manuel Salgado , and construction took two years to complete at a cost of €98 million . Baptised Estádio do Dragão ( Dragon Stadium ) by president Pinto da Costa , for the mythological creature placed atop the club \\'s crest , it was officially inaugurated on 16 November 2003 with a match against Barcelona . Porto won 2–0 in front of a record 52,000 spectators , which also witnessed the professional debut of Lionel Messi . In June 2004 , the venue hosted the opening ceremony and match of the UEFA Euro 2004 , and four other tournament matches . The highest attendance in an official match was registered on 21 April 2004 , when 50,818 people saw Porto draw Deportivo La Coruña without goals , for the first leg of the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League semi-finals . For safety reasons , its current capacity is limited to 50,431 . Museum The FC Porto Museum was inaugurated on 28 September 2013 , on occasion of the club \\'s 120th anniversary . The museum includes an auditorium , a club store , a coffeehouse , and spaces for educational services and temporary exhibitions . Rivalries Porto \\'s biggest rivalries are with the other Big Three members and regular league title contenders , Benfica and Sporting CP . They stem from the historical , political , economical and cultural clash between the cities of Porto and Lisbon , where the other two clubs are based . These rivalries became more intense in the past decades , particularly since Pinto da Costa assumed Porto \\'s presidency in 1982 and adopted a regionalistic and confrontational speech towards Lisbon . In the following years , the club began establishing its dominance in Portuguese football , at the expense of Benfica and Sporting , who had been the traditional powers since the 1940s . To Porto , the rivalry with Benfica is the strongest and most passionate , and it opposes the most representative football emblems from each city as well as the current most titled Portuguese clubs . The first match between Porto and Benfica – traditionally referred to as O Clássico ( The Classic ) – took place on 28 April 1912 , and ended with a 2–8 win for Benfica ; Porto \\'s first victory ( 3–2 ) came only in 1920 . As of the end of the 2014–15 season , the clubs have faced each other in 232 competitive matches , which have resulted in 89 wins for Porto , 86 for Benfica and 57 draws . The first meeting between Porto and Sporting CP occurred on 30 November 1919 , during a friendly tournament organised by Porto . Their first official encounter was in the first leg of the final of the inaugural Campeonato de Portugal in 1922 , which Porto won 2–1 en route to its first national title . Since then , the clubs have met in 221 official matches , with 80 wins for Porto , 78 for Sporting CP and 63 draws . Despite the rivalry , both clubs formed an alliance against Benfica in 2017 . The club also has a strong rivalry with city rivals Boavista , sometimes called O Dérbi da Invicta . Records and statistics Former defender João Pinto holds the record for most matches played in all competitions ( 587 ) and in the Primeira Liga ( 408 ) , while former goalkeeper Vítor Baía has the most appearances in international competitions ( 99 ) . Baía is also the most titled player , having won 25 trophies during his career in Porto . Portuguese striker Fernando Gomes is the all-time club goalscorer in all competitions ( 352 ) , having also scored the most league goals ( 288 ) . In European competitions , Porto \\'s record goalscorer is Radamel Falcao , with 22 goals . José Maria Pedroto is the longest-serving coach , having taken charge of the team for 327 matches in nine seasons , while Jesualdo Ferreira became the first Portuguese coach to win three consecutive league titles ( 2006–2009 ) . André Villas-Boas \\'s victorious campaign in the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League made him the youngest coach ever to win a European competition . The 2010–11 season was particularly strong in record achievements . Porto played the most matches ( 58 ) and secured the most wins ( 49 ) and highest winning percentage ( 84.4 % ) . For the league , it had the most consecutive wins ( 16 ) and suffered the fewest defeats ( none ) . In Europe , the club won the most matches ( 14 in 17 ) and scored the most goals ( 44 ) en route to the UEFA Europa League title – one of a record-matching four .

With over 91 million inhabitants , it is the fourth-most populous state and the fourteenth-largest state by area in India . Covering an area of , it is also the eighth-most populous country subdivision of the world . Part of the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent , it borders Bangladesh in the east , and Nepal and Bhutan in the north . It also borders the Indian states of Odisha , Jharkhand , Bihar , Sikkim and Assam . The state capital is Kolkata , the third-largest metropolis , and seventh largest city by population in India . West Bengal includes the Darjeeling Himalayan hill region , the Ganges delta , the Rarh region and the coastal Sundarbans . The state \\'s main ethnic group are the Bengalis , with the Bengali Hindus forming the demographic majority . The area \\'s early history featured a succession of Indian empires , internal squabbling , and a tussle between Hinduism and Buddhism for dominance . Ancient Bengal was the site of several major Janapadas , while the earliest cities date back to the Vedic period . The region was part of several ancient pan−Indian empires , including the Vangas , Mauryans , and the Guptas . The citadel of Gauḍa served as the capital of the Gauḍa Kingdom , the Pala Empire , and the Sena Empire . Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate , but following the Ghurid conquests led by Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate , the Muslim faith spread across the entire Bengal region . During the Bengal Sultanate , the territory was a major trading nation in the world , and was often referred by the Europeans as the \" richest country to trade with \" . It was absorbed into the Mughal Empire in 1576 . Simultaneously , some parts of the region were ruled by several Hindu states , and Baro-Bhuyan landlords , and part of it was briefly overrun by the Suri Empire . Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb in the early 1700s , the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal , and showed signs of the first Industrial revolution . The region was later conquered by the British East India Company at the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and became part of the Bengal Presidency . The region was a hotbed of the Indian independence movement and has remained one of India \\'s great artistic and intellectual centres . Following widespread religious violence , the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal in 1947 along religious lines into two independent dominions : West Bengal , a Hindu-majority Indian state , and East Bengal , a Muslim-majority province of Pakistan which later became the independent Bangladesh . Post Indian independence , West Bengal \\'s economy is based on agricultural production and small and medium-sized enterprises . For many decades the state underwent political violence and economic stagnation . In 2020–21 , the economy of West Bengal is the fourth-largest state economy in India with a gross state domestic product ( GSDP ) of , and has the country \\'s 20th-highest GSDP per capita of . West Bengal also has the 28th-highest ranking among Indian states in human development index , with the index value being less than that of India . The state government debt of , or 32.6 % of GSDP , is fifth highest India , but has dropped from 40.65 % since 2010–11 . There is moderate unemployment . West Bengal has two World Heritage sites and ranks as the seventh-most visited tourist destination in India . Etymology The origin of the name Bengal ( Bangla and Bongo in Bengali ) is unknown . One theory suggests the word derives from \" Bang \" , the name of a Dravidian tribe that settled the region around 1000BCE . The Bengali word Bongo might have been derived from the ancient kingdom of Vanga ( or Banga ) . Although some early Sanskrit literature mentions the name Vanga , the region \\'s early history is obscure . In 1947 , at the end of British rule over the Indian subcontinent the Bengal Legislative Council and the Bengal Legislative Assembly voted on the Partition of Bengal along religious lines into two separate entities : West Bengal , which continued as an Indian state and East Bengal , a province of Pakistan , which came to be known be as East Pakistan and later became the independent Bangladesh . In 2011 the Government of West Bengal proposed a change in the official name of the state to Paschim Banga ( Pôshchimbônggô ) . This is the native name of the state , literally meaning \" western Bengal \" in the native Bengali language . In August 2016 the West Bengal Legislative Assembly passed another resolution to change the name of West Bengal to \" Bengal \" in English and \" Bangla \" in Bengali . Despite the Trinamool Congress government \\'s efforts to forge a consensus on the name change resolution , the Indian National Congress , the Left Front and the Bharatiya Janata Party opposed the resolution . However , the central government has turned down the proposal maintaining the state should have one single name for all languages instead of three and it should not be the same as that of any other territory ( pointing out that the name \\'Bangla \\' may create confusion with neighbouring Bangladesh ) . History Ancient and classical period Stone Age tools dating back 20,000 years have been excavated in the state , showing human occupation 8,000 years earlier than scholars had thought . According to the Indian epic Mahabharata the region was part of the Vanga Kingdom . Several Vedic realms were present in the Bengal region , including Vanga , Rarh , Pundravardhana and the Suhma Kingdom . One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is a mention by the Ancient Greeks around 100BCE of a land named Gangaridai located at the mouths of the Ganges . Bengal had overseas trade relations with Suvarnabhumi ( Burma , Lower Thailand , the Lower Malay Peninsula and Sumatra ) . According to the Sri Lankan chronicle Mahavamsa , Prince Vijaya ( ) , a Vanga Kingdom prince , conquered Lanka ( modern-day Sri Lanka ) and named the country Sinhala Kingdom . The kingdom of Magadha was formed in the 7thcentury BCE , consisting of the regions now comprising Bihar and Bengal . It was one of the four main kingdoms of India at the time of the lives of Mahavira , the principal figure of Jainism and Gautama Buddha , founder of Buddhism . It consisted of several janapadas , or kingdoms . Under Ashoka , the Maurya Empire of Magadha in the 3rdcentury BCE extended over nearly all of South Asia , including Afghanistan and parts of Balochistan . From the 3rd to the 6thcenturies CE , the kingdom of Magadha served as the seat of the Gupta Empire . Two kingdoms—Vanga or Samatata , and Gauda—are said in some texts to have appeared after the end of the Gupta Empire although details of their ascendancy are uncertain . The first recorded independent king of Bengal was Shashanka , who reigned in the early 7thcentury . Shashanka is often recorded in Buddhist annals as an intolerant Hindu ruler noted for his persecution of the Buddhists . He murdered Rajyavardhana , the Buddhist king of Thanesar , and is noted for destroying the Bodhi tree at Bodhgaya , and replacing Buddha statues with Shiva lingams . After a period of anarchy , the Pala dynasty ruled the region for four hundred years beginning in the 8thcentury . A shorter reign of the Hindu Sena dynasty followed . Rajendra Chola I of the Chola dynasty invaded some areas of Bengal between 1021 and 1023 . Islam was introduced through trade with the Abbasid Caliphate . Following the Ghurid conquests led by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate , it spread across the entire Bengal region . Mosques , madrasas and khanqahs were built throughout these stages . During the Islamic Bengal Sultanate , founded in 1352 , Bengal was major world trading nation and was often referred by the Europeans as the richest country with which to trade . Later , in 1576 , it was absorbed into the Mughal Empire . Medieval and early modern periods Subsequent Muslim conquests helped spread Islam throughout the region . It was ruled by dynasties of the Bengal Sultanate and feudal lords under the Delhi Sultanate for the next few hundred years . The Bengal Sultanate was interrupted for twenty years by a Hindu uprising under Raja Ganesha . In the 16thcentury , Mughal general Islam Khan conquered Bengal . Administration by governors appointed by the court of the Mughal Empire gave way to semi-independence under the Nawabs of Murshidabad , who nominally respected the sovereignty of the Mughals in Delhi . Several independent Hindu states were established in Bengal during the Mughal period , including those of Pratapaditya of Jessore District and Raja Sitaram Ray of Bardhaman . Following the death of Emperor Aurangzeb and the Governor of Bengal , Shaista Khan , the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal became a semi-independent state under the Nawabs of Bengal , and showed signs of the world \\'s first Industrial revolution . The Koch dynasty in northern Bengal flourished during the 16th and 17thcenturies ; it weathered the Mughals and survived until the advent of the British colonial era . Colonial period Several European traders reached this area in the late 15thcentury . The British East India Company defeated Siraj ud-Daulah , the last independent Nawab , in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 . The company gained the right to collect revenue in Bengal subah ( province ) in 1765 with the signing of the treaty between the East India company and the Mughal emperor following the Battle of Buxar in 1764 . The Bengal Presidency was established in 1765 ; it later incorporated all British-controlled territory north of the Central Provinces ( now Madhya Pradesh ) , from the mouths of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra to the Himalayas and the Punjab . The Bengal famine of 1770 claimed millions of lives due to tax policies enacted by the British company . Calcutta , the headquarters of the East India company , was named the capital of British-held territories in India in 1773 . The failed Indian rebellion of 1857 started near Calcutta and resulted in a transfer of authority to the British Crown , administered by the Viceroy of India . The Bengal Renaissance and the Brahmo Samaj socio-cultural reform movements significantly influenced the cultural and economic life of Bengal . Between 1905 and 1911 an abortive attempt was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones . Bengal suffered from the Great Bengal famine in 1943 , which claimed threemillion lives during World WarII . Bengalis played a major role in the Indian independence movement , in which revolutionary groups such as Anushilan Samiti and Jugantar were dominant . Armed attempts against the British Raj from Bengal reached a climax when news of Subhas Chandra Bose leading the Indian National Army against the British reached Bengal . The Indian National Army was subsequently routed by the British . Indian independence and afterwards When India gained independence in 1947 , Bengal was partitioned along religious lines . The western part went to the Dominion of India and was named West Bengal . The eastern part went to the Dominion of Pakistan as a province called East Bengal ( later renamed East Pakistan in 1956 ) , becoming the independent nation of Bangladesh in 1971 . In 1950 the Princely State of Cooch Behar merged with West Bengal . In 1955 the former French enclave of Chandannagar , which had passed into Indian control after 1950 , was integrated into West Bengal ; portions of Bihar were also subsequently merged with West Bengal . Both West and East Bengal experienced large influxes of refugees during and after partition in 1947 . Refugee resettlement and related issues continued to play a significant role in the politics and socio-economic condition of the state . During the 1970s and 1980s , severe power shortages , strikes and a violent Marxist–Maoist movement by groups known as the Naxalites damaged much of the city \\'s infrastructure , leading to a period of economic stagnation and deindustrialization . The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 resulted in an influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal , causing significant strains on its infrastructure . The 1974 smallpox epidemic killed thousands . West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the Left Front won the 1977 assembly election , defeating the incumbent Indian National Congress . The Left Front , led by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) , governed the state for the next three decades . The state \\'s economic recovery gathered momentum after the central government introduced economic liberalisations in the mid-1990s . This was aided by the advent of information technology and IT-enabled services . Beginning in the mid-2000s , armed activists conducted minor terrorist attacks in some parts of the state . Clashes with the administration took place at several controversial locations over the issue of industrial land acquisition . This became a decisive reason behind the defeat of the ruling Left Front government in the 2011 assembly election . Although the economy was severely damaged during the unrest in the 1970s , the state has managed to revive its economy steadily throughout the years . The state has shown improvement regarding bandhs ( strikes ) and educational infrastructure . Significant strides have been made in reducing unemployment , though the state suffers from substandard healthcare services , a lack of socio-economic development , poor infrastructure , unemployment and civil violence . In 2006 the state \\'s healthcare system was severely criticised in the aftermath of the West Bengal blood test kit scam . Geography and climate West Bengal is on the eastern bottleneck of India , stretching from the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south . The state has a total area of . The Darjeeling Himalayan hill region in the northern extreme of the state is a part of the eastern Himalayas mountain range . In this region is Sandakfu , which , at , is the highest peak in the state . The narrow Terai region separates the hills from the North Bengal plains , which in turn transitions into the Ganges delta towards the south . The Rarh region intervenes between the Ganges delta in the east and the western plateau and high lands . A small coastal region is in the extreme south , while the Sundarbans mangrove forests form a geographical landmark at the Ganges delta . The main river in West Bengal is the Ganges , which divides into two branches . One branch enters Bangladesh as the Padma , or Pôdda , while the other flows through West Bengal as the Bhagirathi River and Hooghly River . The Farakka barrage over the Ganges feeds the Hooghly branch of the river by a feeder canal . Its water flow management has been a source of lingering dispute between India and Bangladesh . The Teesta , Torsa , Jaldhaka and Mahananda rivers are in the northern hilly region . The western plateau region has rivers like the Damodar , Ajay and Kangsabati . The Ganges delta and the Sundarbans area have numerous rivers and creeks . Pollution of the Ganges from indiscriminate waste dumped into the river is a major problem . Damodar , another tributary of the Ganges and once known as the \" Sorrow of Bengal \" ( due to its frequent floods ) , has several dams under the Damodar Valley Project . At least nine districts in the state suffer from arsenic contamination of groundwater , and as of 2017 an estimated 1.04crore people were afflicted by arsenic poisoning . West Bengal \\'s climate varies from tropical savanna in the southern portions to humid subtropical in the north . The main seasons are summer , the rainy season , a short autumn and winter . While the summer in the delta region is noted for excessive humidity , the western highlands experience a dry summer like northern India . The highest daytime temperatures range from to . At night , a cool southerly breeze carries moisture from the Bay of Bengal . In early summer , brief squalls and thunderstorms known as Kalbaisakhi , or Nor\\'westers , often occur . West Bengal receives the Bay of Bengal branch of the Indian Ocean monsoon that moves in a southeast to northwest direction . Monsoons bring rain to the whole state from June to September . Heavy rainfall of above is observed in the Darjeeling , Jalpaiguri , and Cooch Behar district . During the arrival of the monsoons , low pressure in the Bay of Bengal region often leads to the formation of storms in the coastal areas . Winter ( December–January ) is mild over the plains with average minimum temperatures of . A cold and dry northern wind blows in the winter , substantially lowering the humidity level . The Darjeeling Himalayan Hill region experiences a harsh winter , with occasional snowfall . Flora and fauna The \" India State of Forest Report 2017 \" , recorded forest area in the state is , while in 2013 , forest area was , which was 18.93 % of the state \\'s geographical area , compared to the then national average of 21.23 % . Reserves and protected and unclassed forests constitute 59.4 % , 31.8 % and 8.9 % , respectively , of forested areas , as of 2009 . Part of the world \\'s largest mangrove forest , the Sundarbans in southern West Bengal . From a phytogeographic viewpoint , the southern part of West Bengal can be divided into two regions : the Gangetic plain and the littoral mangrove forests of the Sundarbans . The alluvial soil of the Gangetic plain , combined with favourable rainfall , makes this region especially fertile . Much of the vegetation of the western part of the state has similar species composition with the plants of the Chota Nagpur plateau in the adjoining state of Jharkhand . The predominant commercial tree species is Shorea robusta , commonly known as the sal tree . The coastal region of Purba Medinipur exhibits coastal vegetation ; the predominant tree is the Casuarina . A notable tree from the Sundarbans is the ubiquitous sundari ( Heritiera fomes ) , from which the forest gets its name . The distribution of vegetation in northern West Bengal is dictated by elevation and precipitation . For example , the foothills of the Himalayas , the Dooars , are densely wooded with sal and other tropical evergreen trees . Above an elevation of , the forest becomes predominantly subtropical . In Darjeeling , which is above , temperate forest trees like oaks , conifers and rhododendrons predominate . 3.26 % of the geographical area of West Bengal is protected land , comprising fifteen wildlife sanctuaries and five national parks—Sundarbans National Park , Buxa Tiger Reserve , Gorumara National Park , Neora Valley National Park and Singalila National Park . Extant wildlife includes Indian rhinoceros , Indian elephant , deer , leopard , gaur , tiger and crocodiles , as well as many bird species . Migratory birds come to the state during the winter . The high-altitude forests of Singalila National Park shelter barking deer , red panda , chinkara , takin , serow , pangolin , minivet and kalij pheasants . The Sundarbans are noted for a reserve project devoted to conserving the endangered Bengal tiger , although the forest hosts many other endangered species such as the Gangetic dolphin , river terrapin and estuarine crocodile . The mangrove forest also acts as a natural fish nursery , supporting coastal fishes along the Bay of Bengal . Recognising its special conservation value , the Sundarbans area has been declared a Biosphere Reserve . Government and politics West Bengal is governed through a parliamentary system of representative democracy , a feature the state shares with other Indian states . Universal suffrage is granted to residents . There are two branches of government . The legislature , the West Bengal Legislative Assembly , consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and Deputy Speaker , who are elected by the members . Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker \\'s absence . The judiciary is composed of the Calcutta High Court and a system of lower courts . Executive authority is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the Chief Minister although the titular head of government is the Governor . The Governor is the Head of State appointed by the President of India . The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the Governor . The Council of Ministers are appointed by the Governor on the advice of the Chief Minister . The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly . The Assembly is unicameral with 295 members , or MLAs , including one nominated from the Anglo-Indian community . Terms of office run for five years , unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term . Auxiliary authorities known as panchayats , for which local body elections are regularly held , govern local affairs . The state contributes 42 seats to the Lok Sabha and 16 seats to the Rajya Sabha of the Indian Parliament . Politics in Bengal is dominated by the All India Trinamool Congress , Bharatiya Janata Party , Congress , and the Left Front alliance ( led by the Communist Party of India ( Marxist ) or CPI ( M ) ) . Following the West Bengal State Assembly Election in 2011 , the All India Trinamool Congress and Indian National Congress coalition under Mamata Banerjee of the All India Trinamool Congress was elected to power with 225 seats in the legislature . Prior to this , West Bengal was ruled by the Left Front for 34 years ( 1977–2011 ) , making it the world \\'s longest-running democratically elected communist government . Banerjee was re-elected twice as Chief Minister in the 2016 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election and 2021 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election with 211 and 213 seats respectively , an absolutely majority by the Trinamool Congress . The state has one autonomous region , the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration . Districts As of 2017 , West Bengal is divided into 23 districts . Each district is governed by a district collector or district magistrate , appointed by either the Indian Administrative Service or the West Bengal Civil Service . Each district is subdivided into sub-divisions , governed by a Sub-Divisional Magistrate , and again into blocks . Blocks consists of panchayats ( village councils ) and town municipalities . The capital and largest city of the state is Kolkata—the third-largest urban agglomeration and the seventh-largest city in India . Asansol is the second-largest city and urban agglomeration in West Bengal . Siliguri is an economically important city , strategically located in the northeastern Siliguri Corridor ( Chicken \\'s Neck ) of India . Other larger cities and towns in West Bengal are : Durgapur , Howrah , Bardhaman , Baharampur , Jalpaiguri , Kharagpur and Chandannagar . Economy , West Bengal has the sixth-highest GSDP in India . GSDP at current prices ( base 2004–2005 ) has increased from Rs 2,086.56 billion in 2004–05 to Rs 8,00,868 crores in 2014–2015 , reaching Rs 10,21,000 crores in 2017–18 . GSDP percent growth at current prices varied from a low of 10.3 % in 2010–2011 to a high of 17.11 % in 2013–2014 . The growth rate was 13.35 % in 2014–2015 . The state \\'s per capita income has lagged the all India average for over two decades . As of 2014–2015 , per capita NSDP at current prices was Rs78,903 . Per-capita NSDP growth rate at current prices varied from 9.4 % in 2010–2011 to a high of 16.15 % in 2013–2014 . The growth rate was 12.62 % in 2014–2015 .

It has been observed that there has been a slow but steady decline in the percentage share of industry and agriculture over the years . Agriculture is the leading economic sector in West Bengal . Rice is the state \\'s principal food crop . Rice , potato , jute , sugarcane and wheat are the state \\'s top five crops . Tea is produced commercially in northern districts ; the region is well known for Darjeeling and other high-quality teas . State industries are localised in the Kolkata region , the mineral-rich western highlands , and the Haldia Port region . The Durgapur-Asansol colliery belt is home to a number of steel plants . Important manufacturing industries include : engineering products , electronics , electrical equipment , cables , steel , leather , textiles , jewellery , frigates , automobiles , railway coaches and wagons . The Durgapur centre has established a number of industries in the areas of tea , sugar , chemicals and fertilisers . Natural resources like tea and jute in nearby areas has made West Bengal a major centre for the jute and tea industries . Years after independence , West Bengal is dependent on the central government for help in meeting its demands for food ; food production remained stagnant , and the Indian green revolution bypassed the state . However , there has been a significant increase in food production since the 1980s and the state now has a surplus of grains . The state \\'s share of total industrial output in India was 9.8 % in 1980–1981 , declining to 5 % by 1997–1998 . In contrast , the service sector has grown at a rate higher than the national rate . The state \\'s total financial debt stood at as of 2011 . In the period 2004–2010 , the average gross state domestic product ( GSDP ) growth rate was 13.9 % ( calculated in Indian rupee terms ) lower than 15.5 % , the average for all states of the country . The economy of West Bengal has witnessed many surprising changes in direction . The agricultural sector in particular rose to 8.33 % in 2010–11 before tumbling to −4.01 % in 2012–13 . Many major industries such as the Uttarpara Hindustan Motors car manufacturing unit , the jute industry , and the Haldia Petrochemicals unit experienced shutdowns in 2014 . In the same year , plans for a 300 billion Jindal Steel project was mothballed . The tea industry of West Bengal has also witnessed shutdowns for financial and political reasons . The tourism industry of West Bengal was negatively impacted in 2017 because of the Gorkhaland agitation . However , over the years due to effective changes in the stance towards industrialisation , ease of doing business has improved in West Bengal . Steps are being taken to remedy this situation by promoting West Bengal as an investment destination . A leather complex has been built in Kolkata . Smart cities are being planned close to Kolkata , and major roadway projects are in the offing to revive the economy . West Bengal has been able to attract 2 % of the foreign direct investment in the last decade .

A study conducted in three districts of West Bengal found that accessing private health services to treat illness had a catastrophic impact on households . This indicates the importance of public provision of health services to mitigate against poverty and the impact of illness on poor households . The latest Sample Registration System ( SRS ) statistical report shows that West Bengal has the lowest fertility rate among Indian states . West Bengal \\'s total fertility rate was 1.6 , lower than Bihar \\'s 3.4 , which is the highest in the entire country . Bengal \\'s TFR of 1.6 roughly equals that of Canada .

In the 19th and 20thcenturies , Bengali literature was modernised in the works of authors such as Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay , whose works marked a departure from the traditional verse-oriented writings prevalent in that period ; Michael Madhusudan Dutt , a pioneer in Bengali drama who introduced the use of blank verse ; and Rabindranath Tagore , who reshaped Bengali literature and music . Indian art saw the introduction of Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20thcenturies . Other notable figures include Kazi Nazrul Islam , whose compositions form the avant-garde genre of Nazrul Sangeet , Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay , whose works on contemporary social practices in Bengal are widely acclaimed , and Manik Bandyopadhyay , who is considered one of the leading lights of modern Bengali fiction .

Fine arts There are significant examples of fine arts in Bengal from earlier times , including the terracotta art of Hindu temples and the Kalighat paintings . Bengal has been in the vanguard of modernism in fine arts . Abanindranath Tagore , called the father of modern Indian art , started the Bengal School of Art , one of whose goals was to promote the development of styles of art outside the European realist tradition that had been taught in art colleges under the British colonial administration . The movement had many adherents , including : Gaganendranath Tagore , Ramkinkar Baij , Jamini Roy and Rabindranath Tagore . After Indian Independence , important groups such as the Calcutta Group and the Society of Contemporary Artists were formed in Bengal and came to dominate the art scene in India . Reformist heritage The capital , Kolkata , was the workplace of several social reformers , including Raja Ram Mohan Roy , Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar and Swami Vivekananda . Their social reforms eventually led to a cultural atmosphere that made it possible for practices like sati , dowry , and caste-based discrimination , or untouchability , to be abolished . The region was also home to several religious teachers , such as Chaitanya , Ramakrishna , Prabhupada and Paramahansa Yogananda . Cuisine Rice and fish are traditional favourite foods , leading to a saying in Bengali , \" machhe bhate bangali \" , that translates as \" fish and rice make a Bengali \" . Bengal \\'s vast repertoire of fish-based dishes includes hilsa preparations , a favourite among Bengalis . There are numerous ways of cooking fish depending on its texture , size , fat content and bones . Most of the people also consume eggs , chicken , mutton , and shrimp . Panta bhat ( rice soaked overnight in water ) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas . Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen include cumin , ajmoda ( radhuni ) , bay leaf , mustard , ginger , green chillies and turmeric . Sweets occupy an important place in the diet of Bengalis and at their social ceremonies . Bengalis make distinctive sweetmeats from milk products , including Rôshogolla , Chômchôm , Kalojam and several kinds of sondesh . Pitha , a kind of sweet cake , bread , or dim sum , are specialties of the winter season . Sweets such as narkol-naru , til-naru , moa and payesh are prepared during festivals such as Lakshmi puja .

Particularly on cultural occasions , men also wear traditional costumes such as the panjabi with dhuti while women wear salwar kameez or sari . West Bengal produces several varieties of cotton and silk saris in the country . Handlooms are a popular way for the state \\'s rural population to earn a living through weaving . Every district has weaving clusters , which are home to artisan communities , each specialising in specific varieties of handloom weaving . Notable handloom saris include tant , jamdani , garad , korial , baluchari , tussar and muslin . Festivals Durga Puja is the biggest , most popular and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal . The five-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state . Pandals are erected in various cities , towns , and villages throughout West Bengal . The city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja . It is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped . The idols of the goddess are brought in from Kumortuli , where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay-models of the goddess . Since independence in 1947 , Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival . Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities . On Vijayadashami , the last day of the festival , the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being dumped into the rivers . Rath Yatra is a Hindu festival which celebrates Jagannath , a form of Krishna . It is celebrated with much fanfare in Kolkata as well as in rural Bengal .

It is the home of Premier League club Newcastle United F.C . With a seating capacity of 52,305 seats , it is the eighth largest football stadium in England . St James \\' Park has been the home ground of Newcastle United since 1892 and has been used for football since 1880 . Throughout its history , the desire for expansion has caused conflict with local residents and the local council . This has led to proposals to move at least twice in the late 1960s , and a controversial 1995 proposed move to nearby Leazes Park . Reluctance to move has led to the distinctive lop-sided appearance of the present-day stadium \\'s asymmetrical stands . Besides club football , St James \\' Park has also been used for international football , at the 2012 Olympics , for the rugby league Magic Weekend , rugby union World Cup , Premiership and England Test matches , charity football events , rock concerts , and as a set for film and reality television . History Early history The site of St James \\' Park was originally a patch of sloping grazing land , bordered by Georgian Leazes Terrace , and near the historic Town Moor , owned by the Freemen of the city , both factors that later affected development of the ground , with the local council being the landlord of the site . Leazes Terrace was built c1830 by notable Newcastle residents , architect Thomas Oliver and builder Richard Grainger . Once the residence of high society in Newcastle , it is now a Grade 1 listed building , and , recently refurbished , is currently being used as self-catering postgraduate student accommodation by Newcastle University . The site was also near the gallows of the city , last used in 1844 , lending the Gallowgate End its name . The first football team to play at St James \\' Park was Newcastle Rangers in 1880 They moved to a ground at Byker in 1882 , then returned briefly to St James \\' Park in 1884 before folding that year . Newcastle West End took over the ground in 1886 . West End were wound up in 1892 and effectively merged into their rivals Newcastle East End , who took over the lease of St James \\' Park and became Newcastle United later that year . On 3 September 1892 , Newcastle East End played its first game on the football ground . Local residents opposition to football being played at St James \\' dated back to the first games in the Football League following the building of the first small stand at the Gallowgate End . A redeveloped Gallowgate and further stands followed in 1899 , bringing the first official capacity to 30,000 ( standing ) . While the stadium is now synonymous with the Black and Whites , Newcastle United actually played in red and white at St James \\' Park until 1904 . In 1905 , a doubling of capacity to 60,000 , with a main stand on the Barrack Road ( now Milburn Stand ) , and major other stands , produced a state-of-the-art facility , even boasting a swimming pool . The second-ever rugby league test match , and first test victory by Great Britain , was played at the ground in 1908 against the touring Australian Kangaroos side on 23 January 1909 . 1920–1990 Between 1920 and 1930 , plans were drawn up for a double-tiered stand by notable football architect Archibald Leitch . However , after planning disputes , all that was achieved was a small roof over the Leazes Terrace side ( Sir John Hall Stand ) . Floodlights were constructed in the 1950s , with the first match played using them held on 25 February 1953 against Celtic . Up until the 1960s planning difficulties continued , culminating in lack of development of the ground being cited as the reason for failure of Newcastle United to secure the right to host a group stage of the upcoming 1966 World Cup following political disputes . In the late 1960s further attempts were made to develop the site , and the council proposed a multi-use sports development of St . James \\' Park . This was rejected as not financially viable . Plans were drawn up by the club for a move to a stadium in Gosforth , or even a groundshare with Sunderland A.F.C . in a new stadium on Wearside . These plans were withdrawn in 1971 after agreement to redevelop St James \\' Park was finally reached , after mediation by the then Minister for Sport , Denis Howell . In 1972 , work started on the East Stand , 50 years after it was last permitted to be developed . In 1978 the Leazes End was demolished , but relegation and financial difficulties meant the new stand was not built . Investigations following the Bradford City stadium fire in 1985 identified a need to replace the ageing West Stand , which was demolished in 1986 . Its replacement , the Milburn Stand , was named in honour of Jackie Milburn and opened in 1987 . Further development was again shelved for lack of finance . Sir John Hall era Until the early 1990s the ground had achieved only modest expansion under various owners , with plans dogged by disputes and lack of finance due to poor on-field performances . In January 1992 businessman Sir John Hall , who had led the Magpie Group consortium in a hostile takeover of the club , was installed as chairman . Sir John used his experience in property development to rapidly gain approval and invested heavily in the stadium with finances gained from success under new manager Kevin Keegan . 1993 expansion The Leazes End that had been demolished but not replaced was finally rebuilt , and opened as the Sir John Hall stand for Newcastle \\'s debut season in the Premiership in 1993 . The Gallowgate End was rebuilt , the Milburn Stand modified , and a new pitch , drainage and floodlights were installed . With all four corners filled in with seating , by 1995 the stadium had reached a capacity of 36,610 . Proposed Leazes Park development As the expanded stadium still received full houses due to continuing success of the team led by the returning Kevin Keegan , in 1995 , plans were submitted by the club to relocate to Leazes Park to the north . A new £65m purpose-built 55,000-seat stadium would be erected , less than two pitch lengths away from the original , but rotated , which would be similar to the San Siro in Italy . The old ground would be redeveloped to be used by Newcastle Falcons Rugby Club , as part of the wider envisaged \\'Sporting Club of Newcastle \\' , with basketball and ice-hockey teams purchased by Sir John Hall . Leazes Park was historically part of the Town Moor , owned by the Freemen of Newcastle , and protected by the Newcastle-upon-Tyne Town Moor Act 1988 . The City council initially invited the planning proposal amid suggestions that the club might move to a site in Gateshead , a 75,000-seat stadium next to Gateshead International Stadium , but it led to political debate and opposition . A pressure group \" No Business on the Moor \" eventually gathered a 36,000-petition signature , equal to the then-current stadium capacity . Opposition also came from a conservation group Friends of Leazes Park led by Dolly Potter . The club proposed to mitigate the loss of the moor land with proposals for a land trade-off with landscaping of land freed up by scaling down of the existing stadium restoring the views of the historic park from Leazes Terrace . It became clear that the relocation plan would not gain planning permission without a potentially long-running public enquiry . To quickly satisfy demand , the club decided to expand the current St James \\' Park instead . Freddy Shepherd era In 1997 Sir John Hall stepped down as chairman ( remaining as a director until 2007 , now life president of the club ) , and existing shareholder and board director Freddy Shepherd became chairman . 1998 expansion Following the withdrawal of the Leazes Park plan , the club proposed expansion of St James \\' Park to over 52,000 capacity , through major construction of a second tier over the Milburn Stand , Leazes End and adjoining corner , adding to a structure that was itself just four years old . After a refusal by the Secretary of State to take the application to an enquiry , permission was obtained in July 1998 . For minimal disruption to seating capacity during construction , the project required 3-day shutdowns of work on home match days . 750 seats were lost during construction . During this expansion , executive boxes in the East Stand were demolished and replaced by seating blocks from pitch level up to the existing rows , in a mirror image of the Milburn Stand . The executive boxes were transferred to the new Milburn/Leazes complex , with more added to the Gallowgate End . During development , the additional stand and roof was constructed while leaving the existing cantilever roof intact until the last possible moment These developments increased capacity to approximately 52,143 . The construction was completed in July 2000 at a cost of £42 million . Ironically , after opposition from local residents to the relocation plan , the expansion of the current ground at the Leazes End has further reduced the view of Leazes Park from Leazes Terrace , although this is now student accommodation . Save Our Seats campaign The 1998 redevelopment caused controversy when the club informed 4,000 season-ticket-holding fans that their seat prices would be increased to corporate rates , with the option of paying these or being moved to seats in the proposed expanded sections . Half of these fans were \\'bondholders \\' , who had paid £500 in 1994 which they asserted guaranteed them an option on their specific seat for 10 years . Some fans resisted , and after two high-court cases and a Save Our Seats campaign , the club was allowed to move the fans , under an exceptional circumstances clause . As a gesture of goodwill , the club did not pursue the fans for legal costs awarded over their insured limit . Casino plans In late 2003 , preempting the relaxation of the UK gambling laws , the club signed a deal with MGM Mirage to hand over the land above St James Metro station , behind the Gallowgate End , in return for an equity investment , to build a jointly run complex centred on a Super Casino . These plans failed when the proposed number of super casinos was reduced to one in the UK , and in January 2008 £5 million was repaid by the club to MGM . Gallowgate additions In 2005 the Gallowgate was redeveloped , with a new bar being built beneath the upper tier of the Gallowgate End , named \" Shearer \\'s \" after Newcastle player Alan Shearer . During excavation underneath the stand during building work , the builders uncovered the original steps of the old Gallowgate End stand , which had simply been covered up when the stadium was fully renovated in 1993 . These steps were removed for Shearer \\'s Bar . The completion of the redevelopment of the Gallowgate saw the creation of Shearer \\'s Bar , an expanded club shop , a club museum and a new box office . 2007 proposed expansion It was announced on 2 April 2007 that the club intend to submit plans for a new £300million development of the stadium and surrounding areas , to include a major conference centre , hotels and luxury apartments . The proposals also include a plan to increase the Gallowgate End , eventually taking the capacity to 60,000 . This expansion would be funded by the city council and linked to the redevelopment of the land behind the stand and over the Metro Station , which had previously been earmarked for the casino project . Expansion of the Gallowgate end involves difficulties due to the proximity of a road , Strawberry Place , and issues surrounding reinforcement of the underground St James Metro station . Mike Ashley era The 2007 redevelopment plans announced under the previous regime were put on hold following the takeover of the club and its plc holding company by owner Mike Ashley . One of the first noticeable changes in the stadium in the new era was the removal of advertising mounted underneath the roofs ( facing the crowd ) for Shepherd Offshore and Cameron Hall Developments , companies associated with the previous regime . A large advertising sign for Sports Direct appeared on the lip of the roof of the Gallowgate , visible from the pitch . A full review of the club performed by the new management team concluded that stadium expansion was not a priority . For the start of the 2008–09 season , the away section was moved from the corner of the Leazes stand/Milburn stand to the other end of the Leazes stand , where it abuts the East stand , at the same upper level . The area of seats designated as the family enclosure were expanded , and certain corporate areas saw increased pricing . The first home game of the 2008–09 season , at 3 pm on a Saturday , saw the lowest-ever Premier League attendance at the expanded ground , of 47,711 , resulting in cash turnstiles . It was speculated at the time that this was due to the credit crunch ; however , with the shock departure of Kevin Keegan before the next home game , future changes in attendances would be hard to attribute to this alone . The first game after Keegan \\'s resignation , a league fixture against Hull on 13 September 2008 , registered a crowd of 50,242 amid protests against Ashley and Dennis Wise . This was followed by an attendance of 44,935 on 27 September in a league fixture against Blackburn Rovers , which followed a record low attendance of 20,577 on Wednesday , 24 September in a League Cup fixture , the lowest ever attendance for a competitive first-team match since the 1993 promotion to the top flight , and a drop of over 4,000 from previous lows . Although Newcastle \\'s crowds inevitably fell in 2009–10 as a result of their relegation and the fact that Britain was still in recession , the Magpies still attracted a modern-day record average attendance for a club at this level with their attendance for the season averaging at 43,383 . They also became the first club to attract a league attendance of more than 50,000 at this level in the modern era , and ended the season promoted as champions of the Football League Championship . In October 2014 , a scoreboard was installed in the far corner of the Sir John Hall Stand . The scoreboard was used for the first time on 18 October during a Premier League tie against Leicester City . However the game was delayed one hour , due to damage caused by strong wind to the paneling surrounding the scoreboard . Newcastle United later stated on their website : \" Supporter safety was of paramount importance . \" Renaming of the stadium On 10 November 2011 , Newcastle United announced that the stadium would officially be renamed Sports Direct Arena , as a temporary measure to \" showcase the sponsorship opportunity to interested parties \" , whilst looking for a sponsor for possible future stadium re-branding . According to the club , the St James \\' Park title was dropped as not being \" commercially attractive \" . Previously , in 2009 , the club had announced plans to sell the naming rights for the stadium . After protests about the possible loss of the name of the stadium , which included the tabling of an early day motion in Parliament , the club clarified the following week that the move would not involve the loss of the name St James \\' Park altogether , citing the example of \\'SportsDirect.com @ StJamesPark \\' as a potential stadium rights package . The following day , the club announced that the stadium would be known as sportsdirect.com @ St James \\' Park Stadium temporarily until the end of the season , to showcase the idea behind the package , until the new sponsor was announced . The stadium \\'s official renaming as the Sports Direct Arena , or SDA , caused considerable perturbation amongst supporters of the team . On 9 October 2012 , payday loan company Wonga.com became Newcastle United \\'s main commercial sponsor and purchased the stadium naming rights . They subsequently announced that the St James \\' Park name would be restored as part of the deal . Saudi-led era Following the takeover of Newcastle United , the new ownership would remove the Sports Direct sponsorship all over the stadium with co owner Amanda Staveley claming she was \" looking forward \" to remove the Sports Direct branding to get new sponsors with the signs being removed on December 6 . With the removal of the sponsor in the stadium former owner Mike Ashley would take legal action against Staveley and her husband Mehrdad Ghodoussi after Ashely aleged that both Staveley and Ghodoussi breached their agreement to continue to sponsor the stadium until the end of the 2021–2022 Premier League season . On October 21 , 2021 , Daily Mail reported that Newcastle United were looking to sell the naming rights of St James \\' Park . However on February 26 , 2022 in interview with The Athletic , Amanda Staveley and Mehrdad Ghodoussi revealed that they were n\\'t going to sell the name rights and moving stadiums but instead were looking to increase the stadium capacity to roughly 60,000-65,000 seats . Stadium description Name Official names St James \\' Park is spelt with James \\' featuring one s and an apostrophe mark , as seen on the signage of the St James \\' Park steps outside the entrance to the stadium , and signage inside the adjacent Metro station . The use of an apostrophe is in contrast with the name of the Metro station itself , which is signed as St James Metro station , and with the street signs of the nearby St James Street and St James Terrace . Further , the use of one s and an apostrophe mark differs from the common convention of adding a second s to monosyllabic possessives ending in s , as is the case with the well-known public space in London : St James \\'s Park . The full stop after the St giving St . James \\' Park is both included and omitted by many sources , including the club \\'s official website address information . Post-millennium it has been debated both whether the written name should include an apostrophe mark after St James , and , if it does , whether the official written form should include an extra \\'s \\' after the apostrophe . Pronunciation of the name with a second \\'s \\' sound or not differs between both the local public and journalists , and is similarly debated . In May 2008 BBC Look North examined the case for adding an extra \\'s \\' , to denote the ground is \" the park of St James \" . The club stated that the ground is named after its neighbouring street , St James Street , which predates the ground , although it was pointed out the road sign of that street , and that of the adjacent St James Terrace , did not feature apostrophes . The BBC stated that both local newspapers The Evening Chronicle and The Journal write the name with a second \\'s \\' , reinstating it partially in response to reader complaints after a period of publishing stories without it . The club insisted the name is pronounced without a second \\'s \\' , whilst it was asserted by the BBC that older fans , in particular , pronounce it with two . A professor of applied linguistics of Newcastle University stated that if a second \\'s \\' was added to the name , it has to ultimately be pronounced in speech . The BBC went on to state that according to the Apostrophe Protection Society , if the ground is named as the \" Park of St James \" , the name of the ground is correctly written as St . James \\'s Park , with the second \\'s \\' pronounced . Commenting on the written form on Radio Newcastle a week after the BBC story , a different senior lecturer in applied linguistics also of Newcastle University stated that if the name is to denote \" the park of St James \" , the written form should feature an apostrophe , but the use of an additional \\'s \\' after it is optional and both are correct . Match-day programmes printed up until the late 1940s have written the name as St . James \\'s Park . According to the club historian , the oldest memorabilia in the club museum refers to the ground as being pronounced without a second \\'s \\' . However , a match-day programme dating from 1896 , reprinted in the match-day programme of a home match against Derby County ( 23 December 2007 ) depicts the stadium name as St . James \\'s Park . Other sources also support the idea that the name should have no apostrophe as found in the name of the adjacent St James Street Nicknames Regardless of the official name , the stadium is known by its initials of St James \\' Park ( SJP ) , or the contraction , St James \\' . In reflection of the early use of the site , it is also often referred to as Gallowgate , not to be confused with similarly unofficially named Gallowgate End , the name of the south stand . Orientation The stadium has a rough pitch alignment of north easterly . The four main stands are as follows : Gallowgate End ( previously known as the Newcastle Brown Ale Stand and before that the Exhibition Stand ) , at the southern end of the ground , named unofficially for its proximity to the old City gallows , and officially after the long association with the club of sponsor Scottish and Newcastle Breweries ; Leazes End ( previously the Sir John Hall Stand ) , at the northern end of the ground , named for its proximity to Leazes Park , and after the club \\'s Life President Sir John Hall ; The Singing Section was positioned in Level 7 of this stand . Milburn Stand , the main stand , on the west side of the ground . Named after 1950s footballer Jackie Milburn East Stand , whose name is self-explanatory , and the smallest stand of the four . Following the death of Sir Bobby Robson , a plan to rename the East Stand the Sir Bobby Robson Stand ( or the Robson Stand ) was drawn up . As yet , this has not been made official . The unofficial new home of the singing section is located in the \" Strawberry Corner \" ( South East Corner , located next to the Strawberry Pub ) - between the Gallowgate End & East Stand . Location The stadium \\'s location is close to the city centre , 500 m roughly north of Central station , the main railway station of the city . The stadium is bordered by Strawberry Place behind the Gallowgate , Barrack Road in front of the main entrance , a car park to the north and Leazes Terrace to the East . Further south is St James station , a terminus station of the Tyne & Wear Metro line to the east , although the main Metro interchange at Monument station , is situated only 250 m to the east . Architecture The Milburn stand is the \\'main \\' stand of the stadium , housing the main entrance , lifts and escalators behind a glass fronted atrium . The dugouts and player \\'s tunnel is located in the traditional position of the middle of the main stand . Behind the seating terraces of the stands , the Milburn/Leazes structure contains four concourse levels , the Gallowgate End has three concourse levels , and the East stand has two concourse levels . The stadium has an asymmetrical appearance from the air and from some angles from ground level , due to the discrepancy in height between the sides and ends of the ground . The height difference between the Leazes/Milburn complex and the East/Gallowgate stands allows views of the city centre from many seating positions inside the ground . Further expansion of the Gallowgate End could potentially produce a more balanced horseshoe arrangement of equal height stands , similar to that of Celtic Park . The Milburn stand and Leazes end are double tiered , separated by a level of executive boxes ; The East Stand and Gallowgate End are single tiered , with boxes also at the top of the Gallowgate . The three newest sides , the Milburn Stand , Leazes End and Gallowgate End are of structural steel frame and pre-cast concrete construction . In common with many new or expanded British football stadiums , the traditional box shaped \\'stands \\' were augmented in the 1993 expansion by filling in the corners to maximise available seating , up to a uniform height . The Milburn Stand and Leazes End now rise higher than this level , covered by a one piece cantilevered glass roof . A further smaller stand section rises above this level behind the Gallowgate End . The 1998 built steel truss cantilever roof above the Milburn/Leazes complex is the largest cantilever structure in Europe at 64.5 metres , eclipsing the 58 m cantilevers of Manchester United \\'s Old Trafford . Seating layout The current stadium design offers an unobstructed view of the pitch from all areas of the ground . The Milburn stand is the location of the directors box and press boxes , and the main TV camera point for televised games . Away fans for league matches were originally accommodated in the upper level , in the north west corner , which can hold a maximum of 3,000 fans . However , plans were made at the end of the 2007–2008 season to relocate the away supporters to the far end of the upper level of the Leazes End . This location has attracted criticism due to the poor view offered by being so far from the pitch due to the height of the stand , and the 14 flights of stairs to reach the upper level . For FA Cup matches the lower section of the corner is also used . The traditional home of the more vocal fans is considered the Gallowgate End , in the same vein as The Kop for Liverpool F.C . The Gallowgate End was the end that the team attacked in the second half if they win the coin toss . In recent years there has been unofficial fan movement to create a singing section in the Leazes End upper tier , partly to counter the away fans , and partly to recreate some atmosphere lost since the recent expansion over 36,000 . This group of fans call themselves the \\'Toon Ultras \\' . Level 7 of the Milburn Stand houses the official Family Enclosure . Due to the expansion of the Family Enclosure , many fans from the singing section have relocated to the Strawberry Corner . In 2013 a group began to help \\'Bring Back The Noise \\' as St.James Park , this being branded as \\'Division \\'92 \\' . This group first began at home to Metalist Kharkiv in the Europea League . From that date the group began to move from strength to strength with new aims set to develop a singing section within the ground for all league games . Facilities As well as the normal Premiership football stadium facilities , the stadium contains conference and banqueting facilities . These comprise a total of 6 suites with a total capacity of 2,050 , including the 1,000 capacity Bamburgh Suite containing a stage , dance floor and 3 bars , and the New Magpie Room , on two levels with a pitch view . The stadium houses premium priced seating areas designated into clubs , each with their own access to a bar and lounge behind the stand for use before the match and at half-time . The Platinum Club , Bar 1892 , Sovereign Club and the Black & White Club are in the Milburn Stand , and the Sports Bar is in the Leazes End The Gallowgate End houses NINE , a sports bar and lounge , which is effectively another city centre nightspot in Newcastle , accessible only from the exterior of the ground . The bar is named after Newcastle United \\'s famous number Nine shirt , which has been worn by famous strikers throughout the years , including Alan Shearer . The Gallowgate also houses a large club shop , a police station . The Milburn stand houses the main box-office . In the south west corner there is also a cafe and a club museum . Statues and memorials Capacity The stadium has a maximum seating capacity of 52,354 , making it : the eighth-largest club football stadium in England , behind Wembley Stadium , Old Trafford , Tottenham Hotspur Stadium , Emirates Stadium , Etihad Stadium , Anfield and London Stadium ; the tenth-largest football stadium in the United Kingdom overall when including the Millennium Stadium ( the national stadium of Wales ) , and Celtic Park ( a Scottish club football ground ) ; the twelfth largest stadium in the United Kingdom overall when including the rugby venues of Twickenham in England , Murrayfield in Scotland . Developments since 1993 have ensured the lower tier of seating of the ground still forms a continuous bowl around the pitch , below the level of the executive boxes . The club record attendance is 68,386 set in 1930 against Chelsea , when standing was allowed on the terraces . Usage Club football Newcastle United have played their home league matches continuously at St James \\' Park . The stadium had not featured a scoreboard or big screen of any kind since the 1993 expansion displaced one from The Gallowgate end , although in 2007 bright red digital time displays were installed near the corner flags at pitch level . A big screen for the stadium was mooted as a possibility as part of a proposed new stadium branding exercise for 2010 . On 18 October 2014 a large scoreboard was erected onto the side of the Leazes End , adjacent to the Milburn Stand . The first day of its use in a game versus Leicester City saw a one-hour delay to kick-off over safety concerns around the screen due to high winds . International football The stadium hosted three matches during Euro 1996 . Along with Elland Road it was assigned to Group B , which comprised France , Spain , Romania and Bulgaria . The stadium was one of several venues used as temporary home grounds for the England team while the redevelopment of Wembley Stadium took place . St James \\' Park also hosted some football matches in the 2012 Summer Olympics . Matches Pitch For football use , the pitch has the maximum international dimensions of 105 by 68 metres . Rugby league On 30 May and 31 May 2015 , the stadium held the Super League Magic Weekend . St James \\' Park was chosen to host the event after the City of Manchester Stadium , which had hosted the event annually since 2012 , became unavailable . The event was considered a success , with the 2015 event setting both single-day and aggregate attendance records for the event . The Magic Weekend returned to St James \\' Park in 2016 , breaking the aggregate crowd record in the process , and returned once again for 2017 and 2018 . The magic weekend is set to return to Newcastle , in April 2021 , for the 2021 Season , after previously been held at Anfield for the 2019 Season and being cancelled for the 2020 season . There have been two rugby league internationals played at St James \\' Park .

Introduced in 1876 by Carl Conrad & Co . of St . Louis , Missouri , Budweiser has become one of the largest-selling beers in the United States . Budweiser may also refer to an unrelated pale lager beer , originating in České Budějovice , Czech Republic ( in German , ) produced by the Budějovický Budvar brewery . The parallel existence of two separate brands with the same name has given rise to a series of trademark disputes between them . Usually , either Anheuser-Busch or Budějovický Budvar are granted the exclusive use of the Budweiser name in a given market . Anheuser-Busch commonly uses the Bud brand for its beer when Budweiser is not available . The AB lager is available in over 80 countries , though not under the Budweiser name where Anheuser-Busch does not own the trademark . AB Budweiser is a filtered beer , available on draft and in bottles and cans , made ( unlike the Czech lager ) with up to 30 % rice in addition to the hops and barley malt common to lagers . Name origin and dispute The name Budweiser is a German derivative adjective , meaning \" of Budweis \" . Beer has been brewed in Budweis ( now České Budějovice , Czech Republic ) since it was founded in 1265 . In 1876 , German-born Adolphus Busch and his friend Carl Conrad developed a \" Bohemian-style \" lager in the United States , inspired after a trip to Bohemia and produced it in their brewery in St . Louis , Missouri . Anheuser–Busch has been involved in a trademark dispute with the Budweiser Budvar Brewery of České Budějovice over the trademark rights to the name \" Budweiser \" . In the European Union , except Ireland , Sweden , Finland and Spain , the American beer may only be marketed as Bud , as the Budweiser trademark name is owned solely by the Czech beer maker , Budweiser Budvar . In some countries , such as the United Kingdom , both the Budvar and Anheuser–Busch lagers are available under the Budweiser name , though their logos differ . Marketing Anheuser-Busch advertises the Budweiser brand heavily , expending $ 449 million in 2012 in the United States . This made it the most advertised drink brand in America , and accounted for a third of the company \\'s US marketing budget . The Budweiser from Budějovice has been called \" The Beer of Kings \" since the 16th century . Adolphus Busch adapted this slogan to \" The King of Beers . \" This history notwithstanding , Anheuser Busch owns the trademark to these slogans in the United States . From 1987 to 1989 , Bud Light ran an advertising campaign centered around a canine mascot , Spuds MacKenzie . In 2010 , the Bud Light brand paid $ 1 billion for a six-year licensing agreement with the NFL . Budweiser pays $ 20 million annually for MLB licensing rights . Budweiser has produced a number of TV advertisements , such as the Budweiser Frogs , lizards impersonating the Budweiser frogs , a campaign built around the phrase \" Whassup ? \" , and a team of Clydesdale horses commonly known as the Budweiser Clydesdales . Budweiser also advertises in motorsports , from Bernie Little \\'s Miss Budweiser hydroplane boat to sponsorship of the Budweiser King Top Fuel Dragster driven by Brandon Bernstein . Anheuser-Busch has sponsored the CART championship . It is the \" Official Beer of NHRA \" and it was the \" Official Beer of NASCAR \" from 1998 to 2007 . It has sponsored motorsport events such as the Daytona Speedweeks , Budweiser Shootout , Budweiser Duel , Budweiser Pole Award , Budweiser 500 , Budweiser 400 , Budweiser 300 , Budweiser 250 , Budweiser 200 , and Carolina Pride / Budweiser 200 . However , starting in 2016 , the focus of A-B \\'s NASCAR sponsorship became its Busch brand . Budweiser has been sponsor of NASCAR teams such as Junior Johnson , Hendrick Motorsports , DEI , and Stewart-Haas Racing . Sponsored drivers include Dale Earnhardt , Jr . ( 1999–2007 ) , Kasey Kahne ( 2008–2010 ) , and Kevin Harvick ( 2011–2015 ) . In IndyCar , Budweiser sponsored Mario Andretti ( 1983–1984 ) , Bobby Rahal ( 1985–1988 ) , Scott Pruett ( 1989–1992 ) , Roberto Guerrero ( 1993 ) , Scott Goodyear ( 1994 ) , Paul Tracy ( 1995 ) , Christian Fittipaldi ( 1996–1997 ) , and Richie Hearn ( 1998–1999 ) . Between 2003 and 2006 , Budweiser was a sponsor of the BMW Williams Formula One team . Anheuser-Busch has placed Budweiser as an official partner and sponsor of Major League Soccer and Los Angeles Galaxy and was the headline sponsor of the British Basketball League in the 1990s . Anheuser-Busch has also placed Budweiser as an official sponsor of the Premier League and the presenting sponsor of the FA Cup . In the early 20th century , the company commissioned a play-on-words song called \" Under the Anheuser Bush , \" which was recorded by several early phonograph companies . In 2009 , Anheuser-Busch partnered with popular Chinese video-sharing site , Tudou.com for a user-generated online video contest . The contest encourages users to suggest ideas that include ants for a Bud TV spot set to run in February 2010 during the Chinese New Year . In 2010 , Budweiser produced an online reality TV series , called Bud House , centered around the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa , following the lives of 32 international football fans ( one representing each nation in the World Cup ) living together in a house in South Africa . On November 5 , 2012 , Anheuser-Busch asked Paramount Pictures to obscure or remove the Budweiser logo from the film Flight ( 2012 ) , directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Denzel Washington . In an advertisement titled \" Brewed the Hard Way \" that aired during Super Bowl XLIX , Budweiser touted itself as \" Proudly A Macro Beer \" , distinguishing it from smaller production craft beers . In 2016 , Beer Park by Budweiser opened on the Las Vegas Strip . On October 7 , 2016 , the Budweiser Clydesdales made a special appearance on the Danforth Campus at Washington University in St . Louis ahead of the presidential debate . A special batch beer named Lilly \\'s Lager was exclusively brewed for the occasion . In December 2020 , Budweiser sent personalised bottles of beer to every goalkeeper whom Lionel Messi has scored against . Containers and packaging Containers Over the years , Budweiser has been distributed in many sizes and containers . Until the early 1950s Budweiser was primarily distributed in three packages : kegs , bottles and bottles . Cans were first introduced in 1936 , which helped sales to climb . In 1955 August Busch Jr . made a strategic move to expand Budweiser \\'s national brand and distributor presence . Along with this expansion came advances in bottling automation , new bottling materials and more efficient distribution methods . These advances brought to market many new containers and package designs . Budweiser is distributed in four large container volumes : half-barrel kegs ( ) , quarter-barrel kegs ( ) , 1/6 barrel kegs ( ) and \" beer balls \" . Budweiser produces a variety of cans and bottles ranging from . On August 3 , 2011 , Anheuser-Busch announced its twelfth can design since 1936 , one which emphasizes the bowtie . Packages are sometimes tailored to local customs and traditions . In St . Mary \\'s County , Maryland , fluid ounce cans are the preferred package . Bottle The Budweiser bottle has remained relatively unchanged since its initial introduction in 1876 . Cans In attempt to re-stimulate interest in their beer after the repeal of Prohibition , Budweiser began canning their beer in 1936 . This new packaging led to an increase in sales which lasted until the start of World War II in 1939 . Over the years , Budweiser cans have undergone various design changes in response to market conditions and consumer tastes . Since 1936 , 12 major can design changes have occurred , not including the temporary special edition designs . Budweiser cans have traditionally displayed patriotic American symbols , such as eagles and the colors red , white , and blue . In 2011 , there was a branding redesign that eliminated some of the traditional imagery . The new design was largely in response to the huge decline in sales threatening Budweiser \\'s status as America \\'s best-selling beer . In order to regain the domestic market share that Budweiser has lost , the company tried to update its appearance by giving the can a more contemporary look . The company hopes that the new design will offset the effects that unemployment had on its sales . Although the more modern design is intended for young male Americans , the new design was also part of an attempt to focus on the international market . Budweiser began selling its beer in Russia in 2010 , and is currently expanding its operations in China . The beer Budweiser is produced using barley malt , rice , water , hops and yeast . The brewing happens in 7 steps : milling , mashing , straining , brew kettle , primary fermentation , beechwood lagering and finishing . It is lagered with beechwood chips in the aging vessel . While beechwood chips are used in the maturation tank , there is little to no flavor contribution from the wood , mainly because they are boiled in sodium bicarbonate ( baking soda ) for seven hours for the very purpose of removing any flavor from the wood . The maturation tanks that Anheuser-Busch uses are horizontal and , as such , flocculation of the yeast occurs much more quickly . Anheuser-Busch refers to this process as a secondary fermentation , with the idea being that the chips give the yeast more surface area to rest on . This is also combined with a krausening procedure that re-introduces wort into the chip tank , therefore reactivating the fermentation process . Placing the beechwood chips at the bottom of the tank keeps the yeast in suspension longer , giving it more time to reabsorb and process green beer flavors , such as acetaldehyde and diacetyl , that Anheuser-Busch believes are off-flavors which detract from overall drinkability . Budweiser and Bud Light are sometimes advertised as vegan beers , in that their ingredients and conditioning do not use animal by-products . Some may object to the inclusion of genetically engineered rice and animal products used in the brewing process . In July 2006 , Anheuser-Busch brewed a version of Budweiser with organic rice , for sale in Mexico . It has yet to extend this practice to any other countries . Budweiser brands In addition to the regular Budweiser , Anheuser-Busch brews several different beers under the Budweiser brand , including Bud Light , Bud Ice , and Bud Light Lime . In July 2010 , Anheuser-Busch launched Budweiser 66 in the United Kingdom . Budweiser Brew No.66 has 4 % alcohol by volume , and is brewed and distributed in the UK by Inbev UK Limited . In 2020 , Budweiser introduced Bud Light Seltzer . In August 2020 , Bud Light Seltzers added grapefruit , cranberry and pineapple flavors , to its original offerings of black cherry , mango , lemon lime and strawberry . In October 2020 , Bud Light Seltzers added Apple Crisp , Peppermint Pattie , and Gingersnap , with the cans sporting \" ugly sweater \" designs . In July 2020 , Budweiser introduced Bud Zero , which is its first alcohol-free , low-calorie , beer . It has zero sugar , zero alcohol , and only 50 calories . Temporary \" America \" labeling On May 10 , 2016 , Advertising Age reported that the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau had approved new Budweiser labels to be used on 12-ounce cans and bottles from May 23 until the November elections . The name \" Budweiser \" was changed to \" America \" . Much of the text on the packaging was replaced with patriotic American slogans , such as E pluribus unum and \" Liberty & Justice For All \" . International production Budweiser is licensed , produced and distributed in Canada by Labatt Brewing Company ( also owned by AB InBev ) . Of the 15 Anheuser-Busch breweries outside of the United States , 14 of them are positioned in China . Budweiser is the fourth leading brand in the Chinese beer market .

He became the youngest ever All Black when he played his first international in 1994 at the age of 19 years and 45 days . Playing on the wing Lomu finished his international career with 63 caps and 37 tries . He is regarded as the first true global superstar of rugby and consequently had a huge impact on the game . Lomu was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame on 9 October 2007 , and the IRB Hall of Fame on 24 October 2011 . Lomu burst onto the international rugby scene during the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens tournament , the same year he made his fifteen-a-side debut . He was widely acknowledged as the top player at the 1995 World Cup in South Africa even though New Zealand lost the final to the host South Africa . His performance at the Rugby World Cup established him as \" rugby union \\'s biggest drawcard \" just as the game turned professional , with him swelling attendances at any match where he appeared . He shares with South African Bryan Habana the Rugby World Cup all-time try scoring record of 15 , which he accumulated in only two tournaments . He played for several domestic New Zealand provincial or Super Rugby sides , and late in his career played club rugby in both Wales and France . These included the Auckland Blues , Chiefs and Hurricanes , and Counties Manukau , Wellington , and later North Harbour and the Cardiff Blues . Lomu was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome , a serious kidney disorder in 1995 , and the disease had a significant impact on his playing career and wider life . By 2003 he was on dialysis and in 2004 underwent a kidney transplant . He then attempted a comeback but did not play international rugby again , and retired from professional rugby in 2007 . He died unexpectedly on 18 November 2015 after suffering a heart attack associated with his kidney condition . Early life and education Lomu was born in Pukekohe , Auckland on 12 May 1975 to Tongan parents . He spent some of his early childhood in Tonga with his aunt Longo and uncle Mosese , and lived in the Auckland suburb of Mangere . There he was exposed to gang violence losing an uncle and a cousin to attacks . This led his mother to send him to Wesley College in Auckland . There , he excelled in athletics , in particular , the 100 metres , shot put , javelin , high jump , hurdles and relay . In his final year , he ran the 100 mts in 11.2 seconds . By 1993 , during his last year at Wesley , he started playing rugby more seriously , while still combining it with athletics . Early career New Zealand sevens star Eric Rush played a touch game with Lomu when he was 14 years old and was so impressed he invited him to a sevens tournament in Singapore the next day . As a youngster however , Lomu first played rugby league . His introduction to rugby union came through a tournament in Te Kuiti where he stayed with Glyn Meads , son of famous All Black Colin Meads . Lomu started his rugby union career in the forwards , mostly as an openside flanker ( no.7 ) , sometimes to the blindside ( no.6 ) , before switching to the left wing in what he described as the \" best move he could have made \" . He represented New Zealand in the national under-19 side in 1993 , as well as the under-21 side the following year . He first came to international attention at the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens tournament as part of a team including Rush . At the age of 19 years and 45 days , Lomu became the youngest All Black test player as he debuted on the wing against France in 1994 , breaking a record that had been held by Edgar Wrigley since 1905 . The match was played at Lancaster Park in Christchurch , and the All Blacks lost 22–8 . The second match was played at Eden Park in Auckland with France winning again , 23–20 . Lomu marked Emile N\\'tamack and admits that his inexperience led to him being exposed by the French team . 1995 World Cup Despite having just two All Black caps , Lomu was included in the squad for the 1995 World Cup in South Africa . Lomu scored seven tries in five matches , two in the first match against Ireland in Johannesburg , a try in the quarter final against Scotland at Loftus Versfeld , and four tries in the semi-final against England at Newlands . The first try in the English match occurred after Lomu received a pass behind him , beat two defenders and then , after a stumble , ran straight over the top of Mike Catt . This reduced one New Zealand commentator , Keith Quinn , to gasps . After the game , England captain Will Carling said : \" He is a freak and the sooner he goes away the better \" . His first score was voted the try of the tournament . In 2002 the UK public voted Lomu \\'s performance no . 19 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments . New Zealand played the World Cup final at Ellis Park against South Africa . Neither side scored a try , with South Africa coming out on top 15–12 after kicking a drop-goal in extra time . 1996–1998 Following the World Cup New Zealand played Australia home and away for the Bledisloe Cup with Lomu scoring tries in both matches . He scored two tries in the All Blacks victory over Italy in Bologna . Lomu played against France in Toulouse , where New Zealand failed to score any tries . He scored a try in the second test in Paris , helping his team to victory . Lomu played for the All Blacks in matches against the touring Samoa and Scotland teams in June 1996 , scoring in one of the Scottish matches . Just before the World Cup final a deal was struck between South Africa , New Zealand and Australia ( SANZAR ) to create the Tri-Nations , an annual round robin competition between the three nations launched with the advent of professionalism in rugby . New Zealand won all their games to become the first Tri-Nations winners . Lomu scored a try in a 43–6 victory over Australia in the inaugural match , which has been described by New Zealand Herald journalist David Leggat as \" the perfect wet-weather game \" . At the end of 1996 , Lomu was diagnosed with a rare and serious kidney disorder , which saw him take time off from the sport . As a result , he did not play in the 1997 Tri Nations Series , but he was included in the All Blacks tour of the northern hemisphere at the end of the year . Lomu played in the two warm up matches , scoring tries against Wales \\' A \\' and Emerging England . He played the first test against England at Old Trafford , as well as the test against Wales at Wembley Stadium , and the second match against England—he did not score in any of the three games . At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur , he won a gold medal representing New Zealand in the Sevens Rugby event . The English rugby team came to New Zealand the following year for a two test series . Lomu played in both of the matches , scoring in the first , which was a 64–22 win in Dunedin , but not in the second test won 40–10 by the All Blacks . 1999 and the World Cup Lomu \\'s 1999 international season kicked off with a warm-up match against New Zealand A , which was followed by a game against Samoa in which Lomu scored one of the All Blacks \\' nine tries . He came on as a replacement in every game of the 1999 Tri Nations Series with Christian Cullen and Tana Umaga preferred as starters on the wings . New Zealand were crowned Tri Nations champions despite losing the last game against Australia . Lomu scored eight tries at the 1999 World Cup . In pool matches he scored two tries against Tonga , one against England and two against Italy . The All Blacks finished top of their pool and proceeded to the quarter-finals . They defeated Scotland , with Lomu scoring one of New Zealand \\'s four tries . Lomu scored twice in the semi-final match against France , though it was not enough to see them through to the final as France went on to win 43–31 . Following the World Cup , despite speculation that he would be moving to play American Football in the National Football League or stay to play rugby in the English Premiership , Lomu returned to New Zealand . End of international career Lomu started 2000 with big victories over Tonga and Scotland . The opening match of the 2000 Tri Nations Series was played in front of a record crowd of 109,874 and has been labelled the \" match of the century \\' . \\' New Zealand scored three tries in the first five minutes to lead by 21 points , before Australia came back , leveling the scores before half time . With minutes remaining , the Wallabies led 35 to 34 ; until Lomu \" brushed past a desperate Stephen Larkham to tip-toe down the line and score the winning try \" . The match was followed by a victory over South Africa , and then a re-match with Australia , which Australia won 24 to 23 . New Zealand lost the final game to South Africa finishing second in the table , behind Australia . Lomu played in one other test that year ; against France at Stade de France in November , which the All Blacks won 39 to 26 . Lomu was part of the New Zealand Sevens team that won the 2001 Sevens World Cup , filling in for Rush , who suffered a broken leg during the competition . In the lead up to the 2001 Tri Nations Series , the All Blacks played Argentina and France at home , Lomu scoring a try in the French match . After a try-less opening victory against South Africa Lomu played his 50th test for the All Blacks at the Carisbrook \\'House of Pain \\' , scoring a try in the second minute of play . The Wallabies spoiled the party however , winning 23 to 15 . This was followed by a win over South Africa , and loss to the Wallabies at Stadium Australia . During the 1999 off season , Lomu transferred to Wellington , signing up with second division club Wainuiomata RFC . Lomu played his debut match against Northern United scoring twice and attracting a bumper crowd and followed that up with a further appearance in 2001 . Lomu wore the green and black club socks when he played for the Barbarian F.C . in 2000 . At the end of the year , the All Blacks played Ireland at Lansdowne Road in Dublin . Lomu was a central figure in the 40 to 29 win , setting up Aaron Mauger for his debut try , and taking an inside pass to blast through for one of his own . The All Blacks end of season tour continued at Murrayfield in Edinburgh , where they defeated Scotland 37 to six , with Lomu contributing one try . In the final match of the tour , the All Blacks played Argentina at the River Plate Stadium . Lomu put the All Blacks in front with a try after Argentina took an early lead . New Zealand won the match by a score of 24 to 20 . In his first test of 2002 , he came off the bench in the second half to score a try in a match against Italy . He was again injected into play from the bench in the first of a two test series against Ireland in New Zealand ; helping New Zealand to an uninspiring win . Lomu was back starting on the left wing for the second test against the Irish , which New Zealand won 40–8 . Lomu did not score in the subsequent match against Fiji ; in performance that was labelled \" disappointing \" by Matthew Cooper after he was beaten on the outside for Fiji \\'s first try . Lomu came off the bench in the All Blacks first game of the 2002 Tri Nations Series against South Africa , though he did not play in the rest of the tournament . He returned to the wing for a game against England in November 2002 . Lomu ended up scoring two tries , though it was not enough to secure a New Zealand victory , with England winning 31–28 . The subsequent match against France resulted in a draw , the first between the two nations in 96 years . The last match of the end of season tour was against Wales , which the All Blacks won 43–17 . These were the last international matches that Lomu would play for New Zealand as his illness worsened and he needed a kidney transplant . Comeback Lomu returned to professional rugby in 2005 . He first needed special clearance from the World Anti-Doping Agency , as one of the anti-rejection drugs he was required to take is on the WADA list of banned substances . On 8 April 2005 , he signed a two-year contract to play for the New Zealand first division provincial team North Harbour in the NPC . He ended up missing the first season when he injured his shoulder scoring a try in a preseason testimonial match against Martin Johnson \\'s invitational XV . Instead he worked in a coaching capacity . North Harbour gave him permission to play overseas at the Cardiff Blues over the off season . Lomu made his first appearance in a competitive match since his transplant on 10 December 2005 , with a 60-minute effort in Cardiff \\'s away Heineken Cup fixture against Italian club Calvisano . Lomu scored his first try for Cardiff on 27 December , with a man-of-the-match performance during a 41–23 win against the Newport Gwent Dragons . He spent the early part of 2006 sidelined while he concentrated on gaining speed and strength not playing again until April . He broke his ankle near the end of his first game back , ending his season with Cardiff . During his time in Wales , he played 10 games and scored one try . He returned to North Harbour for the 2006 NPC season , playing for Massey against Marist in the North Harbour club competition . For Lomu it was \" a small step \" towards his aim of reclaiming his All Blacks jersey for the 2007 World Cup . Lomu played for North Harbour in round four of the National Provincial Championship against Wellington winning 31–16 . Lomu said after the match \" For me it \\'s a dream come true ... I \\'ve always said this is my goal—to come back and play in New Zealand . \" Lomu failed to get a Super Rugby contract , effectively dashing any hopes of making the World Cup squad . Lomu stated that he was disappointed by his failure to gain a Super 14 contract , but that he had not failed himself . Lomu was offered a contract with the Gold Coast Titans , a new Queensland franchise in the National Rugby League competition , but turned it down as it would have been difficult to reconcile his sponsorship contracts with companies associated with rugby union . Retirement Lomu retired from professional rugby in 2007 , but still took part in some charity matches . He was going to play in the Help For Heroes charity match at Twickenham in 2008 , but had to withdraw after injuring his ankle in training . Later that year Lomu played in a charity match at Aberavon RFC \\'s Talbot Athletic grounds to raise money for a local children \\'s charity . The match was covered by the BBC rugby show Scrum V . In September 2009 , Lomu took part in an amateur bodybuilding contest , finishing second in two categories , including the men \\'s open over-90 kg , and the mixed pairs . He joined French Fédérale 1 team Marseille Vitrolles in November , making his debut in a 64–13 victory over against Montmelian . Lomu started the match at centre then moved to number 8 , the position he played as a youngster in New Zealand . Lomu also made an attempt to take part in a charity boxing event in New Zealand called \" Fight for Life \" 2011 , for which he was the intended captain of the rugby union team . It was his intention to fight the main event against former league player Monty Betham . On 14 November Lomu pulled out of the competition as he had just recently been hospitalised for over a week due to his failing kidney . Statistics International tries Lomu scored tries against every major test playing nation in World Rugby except South Africa ( 12 matches ) and Wales ( 3 matches ) . In his career , Lomu scored eight tries against England—more than any other All Black . Lomu set a record of 15 tries in World Cup tournaments , which was equalled by South African Bryan Habana in 2015 . International analysis by opposition Playing style Lomu had a unique combination of power , size and speed that made him devastating with the ball in hand . He weighed 120 kg and was 1.96 metres tall , but could run 100 metres in 10.8 seconds . He ran with a low centre of gravity and was the best exponent at bumping off attempted tackles in the game . He also had a powerful fend and subtle body swerve . He generally stayed out on his wing , but would occasionally replace Zinzan Brooke at the back of the scrum if the All Blacks wanted more power . Personal life In 1996 , Lomu married South African Tanya Rutter and they lived together in New Zealand for four years before divorcing , of which his family never approved . He married his second wife Fiona in a secret ceremony on Waiheke Island in August 2003 , holding a party on the island a week later . In 2008 , Lomu and Fiona divorced after he had an affair with Nadene Quirk . Lomu and Nadene later married in 2011 and at the time of his death he was living with Nadene and their children , Brayley and Dhyreille . Lomu was a member of the Champions for Peace club , a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport , created by Peace and Sport , a Monaco-based international organisation . In 2012 , Lomu and Nadene became members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . In 1996 , McDonald \\'s New Zealand named a burger after Lomu , temporarily rebranding the McFeast burger line ( called \" Mega Feast \" in New Zealand ) as the \" Jonah Burger \" . On 9 April 2007 , Lomu appeared on New Zealand \\'s version of This Is Your Life , in which he was reunited with long time friend Grant Kereama , who had donated a kidney to Lomu when he underwent a kidney transplant in July 2004 . He was a subject of the British version of This Is Your Life in 2002 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while touring with the All Blacks in Edinburgh . Financial troubles Despite making millions during his rugby career , Lomu died with few assets to his name and very little savings . It is believed his earnings were absorbed by his divorces , medical bills related to his kidney disease , and failed business ventures . Lomu was the director and a shareholder in Global 11 Travel , which was liquidated in 1999 . At the time of his death , he owed money on property investments , as well as loans taken out to buy personal vehicles . His family were living in a rented $ 2.2 million ( NZD ) Auckland home . Lomu had sold some of his properties a decade prior , including his Maupuia mansion bought in 2000 , which sold three years later for a reported $ 1.4 million ( NZD ) . Health issues At the end of 1995 , Lomu was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome , a serious kidney disorder . His rugby union career went on hold whilst the disorder was treated . In May 2003 , the NZRFU announced that Lomu had been put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function . Side effects of Lomu \\'s dialysis treatment led to severe nerve damage in his feet and legs ; his doctors warned him that he faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed soon . Lomu underwent a kidney transplant on 28 July 2004 in Auckland , New Zealand . The kidney was donated by Wellington radio presenter Grant Kereama . Death On the morning of 18 November 2015 , Lomu died unexpectedly in Auckland from a heart attack linked to his kidney disease . The previous night he had returned from the United Kingdom with his family after a short holiday stay in Dubai . Lomu had been receiving dialysis treatments during his visit to the UK where he was involved in heavy promotional work during the 2015 Rugby World Cup . His first public service was held in his home church in Mangere , Auckland , with Lomu \\'s family members in attendance . Two public services were held at Vodafone Events Centre in Manukau on 28 November 2015 , and at Eden Park on 30 November 2015 , a day before a private service . A month after his death , an independent trust known as the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust was formed by the New Zealand Rugby Players \\' Association , intended to help support his sons . Legacy Before 1995 , wingers were generally fast and good on their feet . Lomu was the first truly massive wing , a trend that has now become standard in many teams . Lomu has been described as the first true global superstar of rugby union and as having a huge impact on the game , with comparisons being drawn with Muhammad Ali , Don Bradman and Tiger Woods . On his game-changing ability , fellow rugby player Kenny Logan stated , \" you could talk about Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo , that ’ s what Jonah was , someone who could change games if you gave him the ball wherever he was \" . At one time Lomu was considered \\'rugby union \\'s biggest drawcard \\' , as his appearance at a match would increase attendance . Following his displays at the 1995 Rugby World Cup , in December 1995 Lomu received the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year , an award given to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport each year who has also captured the imagination of the British public . Lomu was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame on 9 October 2007 , and the IRB Hall of Fame on 24 October 2011 . He was appointed as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit , for services to rugby , in the 2007 Queen \\'s Birthday Honours . Lomu lent his name to various video games including Jonah Lomu Rugby and Rugby Challenge . He is portrayed by Isaac Fe\\'aunati in Invictus , a film chronicling Nelson Mandela \\'s journey with the South African rugby team in the 1995 World Cup . In March 2018 , Jonah Lomu Drive , in the Paerata Rise development north of Pukekohe , was named in his honour . On 16 November 2018 , an exhibition rugby match was held at Aberavon Quins RFC to raise funds for the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust . The game was organised by a local rugby fanatic , Stuart Broad , as a means to thank Jonah for having turned out to play for Aberavon Naval RFC 10 years previously . The event included players from all over Wales , as well as a Welsh male voice choir , a female vocalist , a brass band , Maori war dancers and a fireworks display . It raised £3,500 in aid of the trust set up for Jonah \\'s two sons . References Further reading Phil Shirley . Blood & Thunder The unofficial biography of Jonah Lomu .

Unmarked , who is the pronoun ’ s subjective form ; its inflected forms are the objective whom and the possessive whose . The set has derived indefinite forms whoever , whomever , and whoseever , as well as a further , earlier such set whosoever , whomsoever , and whosesoever ( see also \" -ever \" ) . Etymology The interrogative and relative pronouns who derive from the Old English singular interrogative , and whose paradigm is set out below : It was n\\'t until the end of the 17th century that who became the only pronoun that could ask about the identity of persons and what fully lost this ability . \" The first occurrences of wh-relatives date from the twelfth century ( with the possible exception ( see Kivimaa 1966 : 35 ) ) . The wh- form does not become frequent , however , until the fourteenth century . \" Notably , relative whose can still today refer to non-persons ( e.g. , the car whose door wo n\\'t open ) . The spelling \\'who \\' does not correspond to the word \\'s pronunciation ; it is the spelling that represents the expected outcome of , while the pronunciation represents a divergent outcome – for details see Pronunciation of English ⟨wh⟩ . The word is cognate with Latin and Greek . Uses As interrogative pronoun \" Who \" and its derived forms can be used as interrogative pronouns , to form questions : \" Who did that ? \" \" Who did you meet this morning ? \" ( formal : \" Who ( m ) did you meet this morning ? \" ) \" Who did you speak to ? \" ( formal : \" To whom did you speak ? \" or \" Whom did you speak to ? \" ) \" Whoever could have done that ? \" ( emphatic form , expressing disbelief ) \" Whose bike is that ? \" ( use of \\'whose \\' as possessive determiner/adjective ; see possessive and English possessive ) \" Whose do you like best ? \" ( use of \\'whose \\' as possessive pronoun ) The same forms ( though not usually the emphatic ones ) are used to make indirect questions : \" We do n\\'t know who did that . \" \" I wonder who ( m ) she met this morning . \" The corresponding form when referring to non-humans is \" what \" ( which has the emphatic form \" whatever \" , and no possessive form ) . Another similar interrogative is \" which \" – this can refer to either humans or non-humans , normally implying selection from a particular set , as either interrogative pronoun ( \" Which do you prefer ? \" ) or interrogative determiner ( adjective ) ( \" Which man should I choose ? \" ) . \\'What \\' can also be used as a determiner ( \" What book are you reading ? \" ) , but \\'who \\' can not . \" Which \" , \" who \" , and \" what \" as interrogatives can be either singular or plural ; ( examples including , \" Which is the highest hill ? \" \" Which are the highest hills ? \" \" Who was born in 1920 ? \" \" Who were king and queen in 1920 ? \" ) however , \" who \" and \" what \" often take a singular verb regardless of any supposed number . The questions \" Who wants some cake ? \" and \" What \\'s in the bag ? \" do not presuppose anything about number in possible responses : \" I want some cake \" , or \" All of us want some \" ; and \" A rabbit is in the bag \" , or \" Five coins and a bus ticket \" . As relative pronoun The other chief use of \" who \" and its derivatives are in the formation of relative clauses : \" These are the men who work upstairs . \" \" This is Tom , who ( m ) I believe you have already met . \" \" I helped some lads whose car had broken down . \" The corresponding form for non-humans is \" which \" , although \" whose \" can be used as a possessive in relative clauses even when referring to non-humans : \" I will have to fix the car whose engine I ruined . \" In restrictive relative clauses , when not preceded by a preposition , both \" who ( m ) \" and \" which \" can be replaced by \" that \" , or ( if not the subject of the clause ) by zero . In relative clauses , \" who \" ( like other relative pronouns ) takes the number ( singular or plural ) of its antecedent . \" Who \" also takes the person ( first , second or third ) of its antecedent : \" I , who \\'am \\' having a hard time right now , wo n\\'t be able to help you . \" \" I , a tired old man who \\'is \\' fed up with all your nonsense , refuse to help you . \" \" Who \" and \" whom \" can also be used to form free relative clauses ( those with no antecedent ) . The emphatic forms are often used for this purpose : informal : \" I \\'ll take whoever you choose \" ; formal : \" I \\'ll take whomever/whomsoever you choose \" . This corresponds to the use of \" what ( ever ) \" when referring to non-humans . ( For the choice between \" who ( ever ) \" and \" whom ( ever ) \" in formal English , see below . ) The emphatic forms can also be used to make adverbial clauses , as in \" Whoever you choose , I \\'ll be satisfied \" . For more details , see English relative clauses . Usage of \" whom \" Tendency to replace \" whom \" with \" who \" According to traditional prescriptive grammar , \" who \" is the subjective ( nominative ) form only , while \" whom \" is the corresponding objective form ( just as \" him \" is the objective form corresponding to \" he \" ) . However , it has long been common , particularly in informal English , for the uninflected form \" who \" to be used in both cases , thus replacing \" whom \" in the contexts where the latter was traditionally used . In 1975 , S . Potter noted in Changing English that , \" nearly half a century ago Edward Sapir predicted the demise of \" whom \" , showing at great length that it was doomed because it was \\'psychologically isolated \\' from the objective pronouns me , us , him , her , them on the one hand , and the invariables which , what , that and where , when , how , why on the other . \" By 1978 , the \\'who\\'–\\'whom \\' distinction was identified as having \" slipped so badly that [ it is ] almost totally uninformative \" . According to the OED ( 2nd edition , 1989 ) , \" whom \" is \" no longer current in natural colloquial speech \" . Lasnik and Sobin argue that surviving occurrences of \" whom \" are not part of ordinary English grammar , but the result of extra-grammatical rules for producing \" prestige \" forms . According to Mair , the decline of \" whom \" has been hastened by the fact that it is one of relatively few synthetic ( inflected ) remnants in the principally analytical grammar of Modern English . It has also been claimed that the decline of \" whom \" is more advanced in the interrogative case than in the relative case , this possibly being related to the degree of complexity of the syntax . However , some prescriptivists continue to defend \" whom \" as the only \" correct \" form in functions other than the subject . Mair notes that : \" \\'whom \\' is moribund as an element of the core grammar of English , but is very much alive as a style marker whose correct use is acquired in the educational system [ , where it is taught ] . [ The use of \" whom \" ] is highly restricted , but rather than disappear entirely , the form is likely to remain in use for some time to come because of its overt prestige in writing . \" \" Whom is also sometimes used by way of hypercorrection , in places where it would not even be considered correct according to traditional rules , as in \" Whom do you think you are ? \" For more examples see the section below . Retention of the \\'who\\'–\\'whom \\' distinction often co-occurs with another stylistic marker of formal or \" prestige \" Englishavoidance of the stranded preposition . This means that \" whom \" can frequently be found following a preposition , in cases where the usual informal equivalent would use who and place the preposition later in the sentence . For example : Formal : \" To whom did you give it ? \" Informal : \" Who did you give it to ? \" In relative clauses , movement of the preposition further allows \" who \" to be replaced by \" that \" or removed entirely : Formal : \" He is someone to whom I owe a great deal . \" Informal : \" He is someone who I owe a great deal to \" , or \" He is someone that I owe a great deal to \" , or \" He is someone I owe a great deal to ... \" Usage of \" who \" and \" whom \" In the types of English in which \" whom \" is used ( which are generally the more formal varieties , as described in the section above ) , the general grammatical rule is that \" who \" is the subjective ( nominative ) form , analogous to the personal pronouns \" I \" , \" he \" , \" she \" , \" we \" , \" they \" , while \" whom \" is the objective ( oblique ) form , analogous to \" me \" , \" him \" , \" her \" , \" us \" and \" them \" . Thus , \" who \" is used as a verb subject , while \" whom \" is used as an indirect or direct object of a verb or as the object ( complement ) of a preposition . Examples : As verb subject : \" Who is waiting over there ? Tom is someone who works hard \" ( original sentence , before being changed to a clause : \" \\'He \\' works hard . \" ) As verb object : \" Whom do you support ? She is someone whom many people admire . \" ( original sentence , before being changed to a clause : \" Many people admire \\'her \\' . \" ) As preposition complement : \" On whom do you plan to rely ? These are the players of whom I am most proud . \" ( original sentence , before being changed to a clause : \" I am most proud of \\'them \\' . \" ) Notice that in a relative clause , the form depends on the role of the pronoun in the relative clause , not that of its antecedent in the main clause . For example , \" I saw the man who ate the pie \" not \" whom \" , since \" who \" is the subject of \" ate \" ( original sentence , before being changed to a clause : \" \\'He \\' ate the pie \" ) ; it makes no difference that its antecedent \" ( the ) man \" is the object of \" saw \" . In the position of predicative expression , i.e . as the complement of forms of the copula \" be \" , the form \" who \" is used , and considered correct , rather than \" whom \" . ( Compare the case of the personal pronouns , where the subjective form is traditionally considered correct , although the objective forms are more commonly usedsee . ) \" Who were those people ? \" \" Who is this ? \" , or \" Who is it ? \" Compare : \" It is I \" ( formal , and traditionally correct ) to \" it is me \" ( informal , but now common usage ) . In the examples that follow , notice how , when the verb is a form of \" be \" , the question \" Who is the captain of the team ? \" or the noun clause \" who the captain of the team is \" ( we know it is a noun clause because it replaces the word \" something \" ) is the same regardless of whether the original placement of the unknown person was before or after \" be \" ( is ) : She asked something . John is captain of the team . Interrogative : She asked , \" \\'Who \\' is captain of the team ? \" Noun clause : She asked \" who the captain of the team is \" . She asked something . The captain of the team is John . Interrogative : She asked , \" \\'Who \\' is captain of the team ? \" Noun clause : She asked \" who the captain of the team is \" . Ambiguous cases A problem sometimes arises in constructions like this : \" Beethoven , \\'who \\' you say was a great composer , wrote only one opera . \" Use of \" who \" here is normal , and to replace it with \\'whom \\' would be grammatically incorrect , since the pronoun is the subject of \" was \" , not the object of \" say \" . ( One would write \" You say [ that ] \\'he \\' [ not \\'him \\' ] was a great composer \" . ) Nevertheless , \" whom \" is quite commonly encountered , and even defended , in sentences of this type . It may arise from confusion with a form like : \" Beethoven , whom you believe [ or \" whom you believe to be \" ] a great composer , wrote only one opera . \" In this case , \" whom \" is used correctly according to the traditional rules , since it is now the object of the verb \" believe \" . ( One would write \" You believe him [ not \\'he \\' ] ( to be ) a great composer . \" ) The use of \" whom \" in sentences of the first type ( \" Beethoven , whom you say was a great composer ... \" ) referred to as \" subject \\'whom \\' can therefore be regarded as a hypercorrection , resulting from awareness of a perceived need to correct \" who \" to \" whom \" in sentences of the second type . Examples of this apparently ungrammatical usage can be found throughout the history of English . The OED traces it back to the 15thcentury , while Jespersen cites even earlier examples from Chaucer . More examples are given below : Young Ferdinand , whom they suppose is drown \\'d , [ ... ] ( Shakespeare , The Tempest , III , 3 ) [ ... ] going to seek the grave / Of Arthur , whom they say is kill \\'d to-night / On your suggestion . ( Shakespeare , King John , IV , 2 ) [ ... ] the rest of their company rescued them , and stood over them fighting till they were come to themselves , all but him whom they thought had been dead ; [ ... ] ( Defoe , The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe , Chapter 6 , Part 1 . Use of whom here may be due partly to the proximity of him . ) But if others were involved , it was Harris and Klebold whom students said seemed the tightest , who stood apart from the rest of their clique . ( From The Age newspaper , Melbourne , Australia , April 1999 , in an article syndicated from the Washington Post . The original article had the \" correct \" who . Note that the continuation with the parallel construction who stood apart illustrates how the use of subject whom can lead to inconsistencies . ) He saith unto them , But whom say ye that I am ? ( King James Bible , Matthew 16:15 . Technically whom here is not a subject , but the complement of the copula am ; but in this position too it is who that would be expected according to the traditional grammatical rules as given in the section above , as it would be in Who am I ? ) Doubts can also arise in the case of free relative clauses , formed with who ( m ) , who ( m ) ever or who ( m ) soever . Modern guides to English usage say that the relative pronoun should take the case appropriate to the relative clause , not the function performed by that clause within an external clause . For example , it is correct to write I \\'ll talk to whoever [ not whomever ] will listen , since whoever is the subject of will listen ( regardless of the fact that the entire clause whoever will listen serves as the object of the preposition to ) . On the other hand , Whomever you choose will suit me is correct , since whomever is now the object of choose ( despite the fact that the entire relative clause is the subject of will suit ) . Similarly : Let whoever is without sin cast the first stone . ( In the internal clause , whoever is the subject of is . ) Whom you choose will be placed on this list . ( In the internal clause , whom is the object of choose . ) In sentences of this type , however , as with the \" subject whom \" examples above , use of whom ( ever ) is sometimes found in places where it would not be expected grammatically , due to the relative complexity of the syntax . In fact in Middle English it was standard for the form of the pronoun to depend on the function in the external clause ; the modern rule came about through re-analysis of the pronoun as primarily an element of the internal clause . Usage of whose Whose is the genitive case of who . The boy whose name I do n\\'t remember came from Japan . Unlike the other forms of who , relative whose ( but not interrogative whose ) can still refer to non-persons , in the way that all forms of the word could in Old and Middle English . The cars whose door wo n\\'t open . See inanimate whose .

The team is governed by the German Football Association ( Deutscher Fußball-Bund ) , founded in 1900 . Between 1949 and 1990 , separate German national teams were recognised by FIFA due to Allied occupation and division : the DFB \\'s team representing the Federal Republic of Germany ( named West Germany from 1949 to 1990 ) , the Saarland team representing the Saar Protectorate ( 1950–1956 ) and the East German team representing the German Democratic Republic ( 1952–1990 ) . The latter two were absorbed along with their records ; the present team represents the reunified Federal Republic . The official name and code \" Germany FR ( FRG ) \" was shortened to \" Germany ( GER ) \" following reunification in 1990 . Germany is one of the most successful national teams in international competitions , having won four World Cups ( 1954 , 1974 , 1990 , 2014 ) , three European Championships ( 1972 , 1980 , 1996 ) , and one Confederations Cup ( 2017 ) . They have also been runners-up three times in the European Championships , four times in the World Cup , and a further four third-place finishes at World Cups . East Germany won Olympic Gold in 1976 . Germany is the only nation to have won both the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Women \\'s World Cup . At the end of the 2014 World Cup , Germany earned the second highest Elo rating of any national football team in history , with 2,223 points . Germany is also the only European nation that has won a FIFA World Cup in the Americas . On 1 August 2021 , Hansi Flick became head coach of the team , after Joachim Löw announced that he would step down after UEFA Euro 2020 . History Early years ( 1899–1942 ) On 18 April 1897 , an early international game on German soil was played in Hamburg when a selection team from the Danish Football Association defeated a selection team from the Hamburg-Altona Football Association , 5–0 . Between 1899 and 1901 , prior to the formation of a national team , there were five unofficial international matches between German and English selection teams , which all ended as large defeats for the German teams . Eight years after the establishment of the German Football Association ( DFB ) , the first official match of the Germany national football team was played on 5 April 1908 , against Switzerland in Basel , with the Swiss winning 5–3 . Julius Hirsch was the first Jewish player to represent the Germany national football team , which he joined in 1911 . Hirsch scored four goals for Germany against the Netherlands in 1912 , becoming the first German to score four goals in a single match . Gottfried Fuchs scored a world record 10 goals for Germany in a 16–0 win against Russia at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm on 1 July , becoming the top scorer of the tournament ; his international record was not surpassed until 2001 when Australia \\'s Archie Thompson scored 13 goals in a 31–0 defeat of American Samoa . He was Jewish , and the German Football Association erased all references to him from their records between 1933 and 1945 . As of 2016 , he was still the top German scorer for one match . The first match after World War I in 1920 , the first match after World War II in 1950 when Germany was still banned from most international competitions , and the first match in 1990 with former East German players were all against Switzerland as well . Germany \\'s first championship title was even won in Switzerland in 1954 . At that time the players were selected by the DFB , as there was no dedicated coach . The first manager of the Germany national team was Otto Nerz , a school teacher from Mannheim , who served in the role from 1926 to 1936 . The German FA could not afford travel to Uruguay for the first World Cup staged in 1930 during the Great Depression , but finished third in the 1934 World Cup in their first appearance in the competition . After a poor showing at the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin , Sepp Herberger became coach . In 1937 he put together a squad which was soon nicknamed the Breslau Elf ( the Breslau Eleven ) in recognition of their 8–0 win over Denmark in the then German city of Breslau , Lower Silesia ( now Wrocław , Poland ) . After Austria became part of Germany in the Anschluss of March 1938 , that country \\'s national team – one of Europe \\'s best sides at the time due to professionalism – was disbanded despite having already qualified for the 1938 World Cup . Nazi politicians ordered five or six ex-Austrian players , from the clubs Rapid Vienna , Austria Vienna , and First Vienna FC , to join the all-German team on short notice in a staged show of unity for political reasons . In the 1938 World Cup that began on 4 June , this \" united \" German team managed only a 1–1 draw against Switzerland and then lost the replay 2–4 in front of a hostile crowd in Paris , France . That early exit stands as Germany \\'s worst World Cup result , and one of just two occasions the team failed to progress from the group stage ( the next would not occur until the 2018 tournament ) . During World War II , the team played over 30 international games between September 1939 and November 1942 . National team games were then suspended , as most players had to join the armed forces . Many of the national team players were gathered together under coach Herberger as Rote Jäger through the efforts of a sympathetic air force officer trying to protect the footballers from the most dangerous wartime service . Three German national teams ( 1945–1990 ) After World War II , Germany was banned from competition in most sports until 1950 . The DFB was not a full member of FIFA , and none of the three new German states – West Germany , East Germany , and Saarland – entered the 1950 World Cup qualifiers . The Federal Republic of Germany , which was referred to as West Germany , continued the DFB . With recognition by FIFA and UEFA , the DFB maintained and continued the record of the pre-war team . Switzerland was once again the first team that played West Germany in 1950 . West Germany qualified for the 1954 World Cup . The Saarland , under French control between 1946 and 1956 , did not join French organisations , and was barred from participating in pan-German ones . It sent their own team to the 1952 Summer Olympics and to the 1954 World Cup qualifiers . In 1957 , Saarland acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany . In 1949 , the communist German Democratic Republic ( East Germany ) was founded . In 1952 the Deutscher Fußball-Verband der DDR ( DFV ) was established and the East Germany national football team took to the field . They were the only team to beat the 1974 FIFA World Cup winning West Germans in the only meeting of the two sides of the divided nation . East Germany won the gold medal at the 1976 Olympics . After German reunification in 1990 , the eastern football competition was reintegrated into the DFB . 1954 World Cup victory West Germany , captained by Fritz Walter , met in the 1954 World Cup against Turkey , Yugoslavia and Austria . When playing favourites Hungary in the group stage , Germany lost 3–8 . West Germany met the Hungarian \" Mighty Magyars \" again in the final . Hungary had gone unbeaten for 32 consecutive matches . In an upset , West Germany won 3–2 , with Helmut Rahn scoring the winning goal . The success is called \" The Miracle of Bern \" ( Das Wunder von Bern ) . Memorable losses : Wembley goal and game of the century ( 1958–1970 ) After finishing fourth in the 1958 World Cup and reaching only the quarter-finals in the 1962 World Cup , the DFB made changes . Professionalism was introduced , and the best clubs from the various Regionalligas were assembled into the new Bundesliga . In 1964 , Helmut Schön took over as coach , replacing Herberger who had been in office for 28 years . In the 1966 World Cup , West Germany reached the final after beating the USSR in the semi-final , facing hosts England . In extra time , the first goal by Geoff Hurst was one of the most contentious goals in the history of the World Cup : the linesman signalled the ball had crossed the line for a goal , after bouncing down from the crossbar , when replays showed it did not appear to have fully crossed the line . Hurst then scored another goal giving England a 4–2 win . West Germany in the 1970 World Cup knocked England out in the quarter-finals 3–2 , before they suffered a 4–3 extra-time loss in the semi-final against Italy . This match with five goals in extra time is one of the most dramatic in World Cup history , and is called the \" Game of the Century \" in both Italy and Germany . West Germany claimed third by beating Uruguay 1–0 . Gerd Müller finished as the tournament \\'s top scorer with 10 goals . 1974 World Cup title on home soil In 1971 , Franz Beckenbauer became captain of the national team , and he led West Germany to victory at the European Championship at Euro 1972 , defeating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final . As hosts of the 1974 World Cup , they won their second World Cup , defeating the Netherlands 2–1 in the final in Munich . Two matches in the 1974 World Cup stood out for West Germany . The first group stage saw a politically charged match as West Germany played a game against East Germany . The East Germans won 1–0 . The West Germans advanced to the final against the Johan Cruijff-led Dutch team and their brand of \" Total Football \" . The Dutch took the lead from a penalty . However , West Germany tied the match on a penalty by Paul Breitner , and won it with Gerd Müller \\'s fine finish soon after . Late 1970s and early 1980s West Germany failed to defend their titles in the next two major international tournaments . They lost to Czechoslovakia in the final of Euro 1976 in a penalty shootout 5–3 . Since that loss , Germany has not lost a penalty shootout in major international tournaments . In the 1978 World Cup , Germany was eliminated in the second group stage after losing 3–2 to Austria . Schön retired as coach afterward , and the post was taken over by his assistant , Jupp Derwall . West Germany \\'s first tournament under Derwall was successful , as they earned their second European title at Euro 1980 after defeating Belgium 2–1 in the final . West Germany reached the final of the 1982 World Cup , though not without difficulties . They were upset 1–2 by Algeria in their first match , but advanced to the second round with a controversial 1–0 win over Austria . In the semi-final against France , they tied the match 3–3 and won the penalty shootout 5–4 . In the final , they were defeated by Italy 1–3 . During this period , West Germany \\'s Gerd Müller racked up fourteen goals in two World Cups ( 1970 and 1974 ) . His ten goals in 1970 are the third-most ever in a tournament . ( Müller \\'s all-time World Cup record of 14 goals was broken by Ronaldo in 2006 ; this was then further broken by Miroslav Klose in 2014 with 16 goals ) . Beckenbauer \\'s managing success ( 1984–1990 ) After West Germany were eliminated in the first round of Euro 1984 , Franz Beckenbauer returned to the national team to replace Derwall as manager . At the 1986 World Cup in Mexico , West Germany finished as runners-up for the second consecutive tournament after beating France 2–0 in the semi-finals , but losing to the Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the final , 2–3 . In Euro 1988 , after drawing Italy 1-1 and beating both Denmark and Spain 2–0 in the group stage , West Germany \\'s hopes of winning the tournament on home soil were spoiled by the Netherlands , as the Dutch beat them 2–1 in the semi-finals . At the 1990 World Cup in Italy , West Germany won their third World Cup title , in its unprecedented third consecutive final appearance . Captained by Lothar Matthäus , they defeated Yugoslavia ( 4–1 ) , UAE ( 5–1 ) , the Netherlands ( 2–1 ) , Czechoslovakia ( 1–0 ) , and England ( 1–1 , 4–3 on penalty kicks ) on the way to a final rematch against Argentina , played in the Italian capital of Rome . West Germany won 1–0 , with the only goal being a penalty scored in the 85th minute by Andreas Brehme . Beckenbauer , who won the World Cup as the national team \\'s captain in 1974 , thus became the first person to win the World Cup as both captain and manager , and the second to win as player and manager ( after Mario Zagallo of Brazil ) . Olympic football Prior to 1984 , Olympic football was an amateur event , meaning that only non-professional players could participate due to this , West Germany was never able to achieve the same degree of success at the Olympics as at the World Cup . The first medal coming in the 1988 Olympics , when they won the bronze medal after beating Italy 3–0 in the 3rd place match . West Germany also reached the second round in both 1972 and 1984 . On the other hand , due to having an ability to field its top-level players who were classified as amateurs on a technicality East Germany did better , winning a gold , a silver and two bronze medals ( one representing the United Team of Germany ) . Berti Vogts years ( 1990–1998 ) In February 1990 , months after the fall of the Berlin Wall , East Germany and West Germany were drawn together in UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying Group 5 . In November 1990 , the East German association Deutscher Fußball-Verband integrated into the DFB , by which time the East German team had ceased operations , playing its last match on 12 September 1990 . The unified German national team completed the European Championship qualifying group . The East German 1990–91 league continued , with a restructuring of German leagues in 1991–92 . The first game with a unified German team was against Sweden on 10 October . After the 1990 World Cup , assistant Berti Vogts took over as the national team coach from the retiring Beckenbauer . In Euro 1992 , Germany reached the final , but lost 0–2 to underdogs Denmark . In the 1994 World Cup , they were upset 1–2 in the quarterfinals by Bulgaria . Reunified Germany won its first major international title at Euro 1996 , becoming European champions for the third time . They defeated hosts England in the semi-finals , and the Czech Republic 2–1 in the final on a golden goal in extra time . However , in the 1998 World Cup , Germany were eliminated in the quarterfinals in a 0–3 defeat to Croatia , all goals being scored after defender Christian Wörns received a straight red card . Vogts stepped down afterwards and was replaced by Erich Ribbeck . Erich Ribbeck and Rudi Völler years ( 2000–2004 ) In Euro 2000 , the team went out in the first round , drawing with Romania , then suffering a 1–0 defeat to England and were routed 3–0 by Portugal ( which fielded their backup players , having already advanced ) . Ribbeck resigned , and was replaced by Rudi Völler . Coming into the 2002 World Cup , expectations of the German team were low due to poor results in the qualifiers and not directly qualifying for the finals for the first time . The team advanced through group play , and in the knockout stages they produced three consecutive 1–0 wins against Paraguay , the United States , and co-hosts South Korea . Oliver Neuville scored two minutes from time against Paraguay and Michael Ballack scored both goals in the US and South Korea games , although he picked up a second yellow card against South Korea for a tactical foul and was suspended for the subsequent match . This set up a final against Brazil , the first World Cup meeting between the two . Germany lost 0–2 thanks to two Ronaldo goals . Nevertheless , German captain and goalkeeper Oliver Kahn won the Golden Ball , the first time in the World Cup that a goalkeeper was named the best player of the tournament . Germany again exited in the first round of Euro 2004 , drawing their first two matches and losing the third to the Czech Republic ( who had fielded a second-string team ) . Völler resigned afterwards , and Jürgen Klinsmann was appointed head coach . Resurgence under Klinsmann ( 2004-2006 ) Klinsmann \\'s main task was to lead the national team to a good showing at the 2006 World Cup in Germany . Klinsmann relieved goalkeeper Kahn of the captaincy and announced that Kahn and longtime backup Jens Lehmann would be competing for the position of starting goaltender , a decision that angered Kahn and Lehmann eventually won that contest . Expectations for the team were low , which was not helped by veteran defender Christian Wörns being dropped ( after Wörns criticised Klinsmann for designating him only as a backup player on the squad ) , a choice roundly panned in Germany . Italy routed Germany 4–1 in a March exhibition game , and Klinsmann bore the brunt of the criticism as the team was ranked only 22nd in the world entering the 2006 FIFA World Cup . As World Cup hosts , Germany won all three group-stage matches to finish top of their group . The team defeated Sweden 2–0 in the round of 16 . Germany faced Argentina in the quarter-finals . The match ended 1–1 , and Germany won the penalty shootout 4–2 . In the semi-final against Italy , the match was scoreless until near the end of extra time when Germany conceded two goals . In the third place match , Germany defeated Portugal 3–1 . Miroslav Klose was awarded the Golden Boot for his tournament-leading five goals . Löw era ( 2006–2021 ) Germany \\'s entry into the Euro 2008 qualifying round was marked by the promotion of Joachim Löw to head coach , since Klinsmann resigned . At UEFA Euro 2008 , Germany won two out of three matches in group play to advance to the knockout round . They defeated Portugal 3–2 in the quarterfinal , and won their semi-final against Turkey . Germany lost the final against Spain 0–1 , finishing as the runners-up . In the 2010 World Cup , Germany won the group and advanced to the knockout stage . In the round of 16 , Germany defeated England 4–1 . The game controversially had a valid goal by Frank Lampard disallowed . In the quarterfinals , Germany defeated Argentina 4–0 , and Miroslav Klose tied German Gerd Müller \\'s record of 14 World Cup goals . In the semi-final , Germany lost 1–0 to Spain . Germany defeated Uruguay 3–2 to take third place ( their second third place after 2006 ) . German Thomas Müller won the Golden Boot and the Best Young Player Award . In Euro 2012 , Germany was placed in group B along with Portugal , Netherlands , and Denmark . Germany won all three group matches . Germany defeated Greece in the quarter-final and set a record of 15 consecutive wins in all competitive matches . In the semi-finals , Germany lost to Italy , 1–2 . 2014 World Cup victory Germany finished first in their qualification group for the 2014 World Cup . The draw for the 2014 World Cup finals placed Germany in Group G , with Portugal , Ghana , and United States . They first faced Portugal in a match billed by some as the \" team of all the talents against the team of The Talent ( Cristiano Ronaldo ) \" , routing the Portuguese 4–0 thanks to a hat-trick by Thomas Müller . In their match with Ghana , they led the game with Götze \\'s second half goal , but then conceded two consecutive goals , then at the 71st minute Klose scored a goal to help Germany to draw 2–2 with Ghana . With that goal , Klose also nudged home his 15th World Cup goal to join former Brazil striker Ronaldo at the pinnacle of World Cup Finals scorers . They then went on to defeat the United States team 1–0 , securing them a spot in the round of sixteen against Algeria . The round of sixteen knockout match against Algeria remained goalless after regulation time , resulting in extra time . In the 92nd minute , André Schürrle scored a goal from a Thomas Müller pass . Mesut Özil scored Germany \\'s second goal in the 120th minute . Algeria managed to score one goal in injury time and the match ended 2–1 . Germany secured a place in the quarter-final , where they would face France . In the quarter-final match against France , Mats Hummels scored in the 13th minute . Germany won the game 1–0 to advance to a record fourth consecutive semi-finals . The semi-final win ( 7–1 ) against Brazil was a major accomplishment . Germany scored four goals in just less than seven minutes and were 5–0 up against Brazil by the 30th minute with goals from Thomas Müller , Miroslav Klose , Sami Khedira and two from Toni Kroos . Klose \\'s goal in the 23rd minute , his 16th World Cup goal , gave him sole possession of the record for most goals scored during World Cup Finals , dethroning former Brazil national Ronaldo . In the second half of the game , substitute André Schürrle scored twice for Germany to lead 7–0 , the highest score against Brazil in a single game . Germany did , however , concede a late goal to Brazil \\'s Oscar . It was Brazil \\'s worst ever World Cup defeat , whilst Germany broke multiple World Cup records with the win , including the record broken by Klose , the first team to reach four consecutive World Cup semi-finals , the first team to score seven goals in a World Cup Finals knockout phase game , the fastest five consecutive goals in World Cup history ( four of which in just 400 seconds ) , the first team to score five goals in the first half in a World Cup semi-final as well as being the topic of the most tweets ever on Twitter about a certain subject when the previous social media record was smashed after Germany scored their fourth goal . Also , Germany \\'s seven goals took their total tally in World Cup history to 223 , surpassing Brazil \\'s 221 goals to first place overall . The World Cup Final was held at the Maracana in Rio de Janeiro on 13 July , and billed as the world \\'s best player ( Lionel Messi ) versus the world \\'s best team ( Germany ) . Mario Götze \\'s 113th-minute goal helped Germany beat Argentina 1–0 , becoming the first-ever European team to win a FIFA World Cup in the Americas and the second European team to win the title outside Europe . Euro 2016 to 2017 Confederations Cup After several players retired from the team following the 2014 World Cup win , including Philipp Lahm , Per Mertesacker and Miroslav Klose , the team had a disappointing start in the UEFA Euro 2016 qualifiers . They defeated Scotland 2–1 at home , then suffered a 2–0 loss at Poland ( the first in their history ) , a 1–1 draw against the Republic of Ireland , and a 4–0 win over Gibraltar . The year ended with an away 0–1 friendly win against Spain , the reigning European champions of 2008 and 2012 . Troubles during qualifying for the 2016 European Championship continued , drawing at home , as well as losing away , to Ireland ; the team also only narrowly defeated Scotland on two occasions , but handily won the return against Poland and both games against Gibraltar ( who competed for the first time ) . Eventually , however , topping their group and qualifying for the tournament through a 2–1 victory against Georgia on 11 October 2015 ( having won the first match against them ) . On 13 November 2015 , the team was playing a friendly match against France in Paris when a series of terrorist attacks took place in the city , some in the direct vicinity of the Stade de France , where the game was held . For security reasons , the team needed to spend the night inside the stadium , accompanied by the French squad who stayed behind in an act of comradery . Four days later , on 17 November 2015 , the German team was scheduled to face the Netherlands at Hanover \\'s HDI-Arena , also in a friendly . After initial security reservations , the DFB decided to play the match on 15 November . However , after reports about a concrete threat to the stadium , the match was cancelled ninety minutes before kickoff . Germany began their preparations for Euro 2016 in March with friendlies against England and Italy . They gave up a 2–0 lead to England , and ended up losing 2–3 . They bounced back in their match with Italy , however , winning by a score of 4–1 . It was their first win against the Italians in 21 years . Germany began their campaign for a fourth European title with a 2–0 win against Ukraine on 12 June . Against Poland , Germany was held to a 0–0 draw but concluded Group C with a 1–0 win against Northern Ireland . In the Round of 16 , Germany faced Slovakia and earned a comfortable 3–0 win . Germany then faced off against rivals Italy in the quarter-finals . Mesut Özil opened the scoring in the 65th minute for Germany , before Leonardo Bonucci drew even after converting a penalty in the 78th minute . The score remained 1–1 after extra time and Germany beat Italy 6–5 in a penalty shootout . It was the first time Germany had overcome Italy in a major tournament . In the semi-finals Germany played the host nation France . Germany \\'s hopes of securing a fourth European championship were put on hold however as France ended Germany \\'s run by eliminating them by a score of 0–2 . It was France \\'s first competitive win against Germany in 58 years . On 2 July 2017 , Germany won the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup after a 1–0 win against Chile in the final at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg , it was their only FIFA Confederations Cup title . Disappointment at the 2018 World Cup , 2018–19 UEFA Nations League and Euro 2020 Despite winning all their qualifying matches and the Confederations Cup the previous year , Germany started their 2018 World Cup campaign with a defeat to Mexico . This was their first loss in an opening match since the 1982 World Cup . Germany defeated Sweden 2–1 in their second game via an injury-time winner from Toni Kroos , but was subsequently eliminated following a 2–0 loss to South Korea , their first exit in the first round since 1938 and first ever in group stage since the format had been reintroduced in 1950 . Following the World Cup , Germany \\'s struggles continued into the UEFA Nations League . After a 0–0 draw at home against France , they lost 3–0 against the Netherlands and 1–2 in the rematch against France three days later ; the latter result being their fourth loss in six competitive matches . These results meant that Germany could not advance to the 2019 UEFA Nations League Finals and faced the prospect of possible relegation to League B in the next Nations League . After the Netherlands \\' win against France , the relegation to League B was originally confirmed , but due to the overhaul of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League , Germany was spared from relegation to League B . In March 2021 , the DFB announced that Löw would step down as Germany \\'s manager after the team competes in UEFA Euro 2020 . Later that month , Germany lost 1–2 at home to North Macedonia in the 2022 World Cup qualifiers , their first World Cup qualification defeat since losing 5–1 to England in the 2002 World Cup qualifiers and only their third in history . On 25 May 2021 , the DFB announced that former assistant manager Hansi Flick will replace Löw as head coach . At Euro 2020 ( delayed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic ) , Germany were drawn in a tough group , along with World Cup champions France ( to whom they lost 1–0 ) and reigning European champions Portugal ( whom they defeated 4–2 , albeit with the help of two Portuguese own goals ) , with each group having only two guaranteed qualifiers for the next phase , plus a chance for the third-placed team . In the final group match , against Hungary - expected to be the group \\'s minnows - it was the Hungarians who took the lead twice , and Germany risked a second successive group-stage elimination , securing their qualification for the next phase only with a late equalizer which lifted them from fourth place to second in the group . They progressed no further than that , however : Löw \\'s final match as Germany \\'s manager was on 29 June 2021 , when Germany lost 2–0 to England in the round of 16 of Euro 2020 . Revival under Flick ( 2021–present ) Following Germany \\'s disappointment at Euro 2020 , Hansi Flick , former Bayern Munich manager , took over as coach of the national team . Success only followed from there , as Germany went on to beat Liechtenstein , Armenia , Iceland , Romania and North Macedonia in a month \\'s succession . On 11 October 2021 , Germany beat North Macedonia 4–0 to become the first team to qualify for the world cup in Qatar . Team image Kits and crest The national team \\'s home kit has always been a white shirt , black shorts , and white socks . The colours are derived from the 19th-century flag of the North German State of Prussia . Since 1988 , many of the home kit \\'s designs incorporate details patterned after the modern German flag . For the 2014 World Cup , the German team used white shorts rather than the traditional black due to FIFA \\'s kit clashing rule for the tournament . The away shirt colour has changed several times . Historically , green shirt with white shorts is the most often used alternative colour combination , derived from the DFB colours – though it is often erroneously reported that the choice is in recognition of the fact that Ireland , whose home shirts are green , were the first nation to play Germany in a friendly game after World War II . However , the first team to play Germany after WWII , as stated above , was actually Switzerland . Other colours such as red , grey and black have also been used . A change from black to red came in 2005 on the request of Jürgen Klinsmann , but Germany played every game at the 2006 World Cup in its home white colours . In 2010 , the away colours then changed back to a black shirt and white shorts , but at the tournament , the team dressed up in the black shorts from the home kit . The German team next resumed the use of a green shirt on its away kit , but then changed again to red-and-black striped shirts with white stripes and letters and black shorts . Adidas AG is the longstanding kit provider to the national team , a sponsorship that began in 1954 and is contracted to continue until at least 2022 . In the 70s , Germany wore Erima kits ( a German brand , formerly a subsidiary of Adidas ) . Kit suppliers Kit deals Home stadium Germany plays its home matches among various stadiums , in rotation , around the country . They have played home matches in 43 different cities so far , including venues that were German at the time of the match , such as Vienna , Austria , which staged three games between 1938 and 1942 . National team matches have been held most often ( 46 times ) in the stadiums of Berlin , which was the venue of Germany \\'s first home match ( in 1908 against England ) . Other common host cities include Hamburg ( 34 matches ) , Stuttgart ( 32 ) , Hanover ( 28 ) and Dortmund . Another notable location is Munich , which has hosted numerous notable matches throughout the history of German football , including the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final , which West Germany won against the Netherlands . Media coverage Germany \\'s qualifying and friendly matches are televised by privately owned RTL ; Nations League by public broadcasters ARD and ZDF . World Cup & European Championships matches featuring the German national team are among the most-watched events in the history of television in Germany .

It has finished as runners-up four times . In terms of semi-final appearances , Germany leads with 13 , two more than Brazil \\'s 11 , which had participated in two more tournaments . From 1954 to 2014 ( 16 tournament editions ) , Germany always reached at least the stage of the last eight teams , before being eliminated in the group stage in 2018 . Germany has also qualified for every one of the 19 World Cups for which it has entered – it did not enter the inaugural competition in Uruguay of 1930 for economic reasons , and could not qualify for or compete in the post-war 1950 World Cup as the DFB was reinstated as a FIFA member only two months after this tournament . Germany also has the distinction of having an Elo football rating of 2196 following their victory in the 2014 World Cup , which was higher than any previous champion . Germany has also won the European Championship three times ( Spain , with three titles , France and Italy , with two titles each , are the only other multiple-time winners ) , and finished as runners-up three times as well . The Germans have qualified for every European Championship tournament except for the first European Championship they entered in 1968 . For that tournament , Germany was in the only group of three teams and thus only played four qualifying games . The deciding game was a scoreless draw in Albania which gave Yugoslavia the edge , having won in their neighbour country . The team finished out of top eight only in two occasions , the tournaments of 2000 and 2004 . In the other ten editions Germany participated in they reached nine times at least the semi-finals , an unparalleled record in Europe .

They include Odin , Frigg , Höðr , Thor , and Baldr . The second Norse pantheon is the Vanir . In Norse mythology , the two pantheons wage war against each other , resulting in a unified pantheon . Unlike the Old English word god ( and the Old Norse word ) , Æsir was never converted over to Christian use . Etymology Æsir is the plural of áss , ǫ́ss \" god \" . In genitival compounds , it takes the form , e.g . in ( \" Thor of the Æsir \" ) , besides found in ás-brú \" gods \\' bridge \" ( the rainbow ) , \" gods \\' garden \" , \" gods \\' kin \" , \" gods \\' leader \" , \" gods \\' might \" ( especially of Thor ) , \" divine wrath \" etc . \" national god \" ( ) is a title of Thor , as is \" almighty god \" , while it is Odin who is \" the \" . There is also Old East Norse dialectal * ās-ækia ( OWN : * áss-ekja ) , i.e . \" god ride \" ( Thor riding in his wagon ) , resulting in the modern Swedish word åska for atmospheric thunder ( the form åsekia attested as late as the 17th c. ) . The feminine form is ( plural ) . The word áss is attested in modified form in other Germanic languages , such as Old English ( ) ( plural ) , denoting a deity in Anglo-Saxon paganism , preserved as a prefix in personal names ( e.g . Osborne , Oswald ) and place-names , and as the genitive plural . In Old High German , Old Dutch and Old Saxon , the word is only attested in personal and place names , e.g . Ansebert , Anselm , Ansfrid , Vihans . The Old High German is reconstructed as * , plural * . Gothic has as reported by Jordanes , who wrote in the 6th century CE , presumably a Latinized form of actual plural ) , as a name for euhemerized semi-divine early Gothic rulers . The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is ( plural ) . The ansuz rune , , was named after the Æsir . * ansuz , itself comes from Proto-Indo-European * h₂énsus ( gen . ) \" life force \" ( cf . Avestan aŋhū \" lord ; lifetime \" , ahura \" godhood \" , Sanskrit ásu \" life force \" , ásura \" demons \" ( * ) . It is widely accepted that this word is further related to * - \" to engender \" ( cf . Hittite hass- \" to procreate , give birth \" , Tocharian B ās- \" to produce \" ) . Norse mythology The interaction between the Æsir and the Vanir has provoked a considerable amount of scholarly theory and speculation . While other cultures have had \" elder \" and \" younger \" families of gods , as with the Titans versus the Olympians of ancient Greece , the Æsir and Vanir are portrayed in myth as contemporaries : The two clans of gods fought battles , concluded treaties , exchanged hostages ( Freyr and Freyja are mentioned as hostages ) , and intermarried . An áss like Ullr is almost unknown in the myths , but his name is seen in a lot of geographical names , especially in Sweden , and may also appear on the 3rd century Thorsberg chape , suggesting that his cult was widespread in prehistoric times . The names of the first three Æsir in Norse mythology , Vili , Vé and Odin all refer to spiritual or mental state , vili to conscious will or desire , vé to the sacred or numinous and óðr to the manic or ecstatic . Æsir and Vanir The second clan of gods mentioned in Norse mythology is the Vanir : The god Njörðr and his children , Freyr and Freyja , are the most prominent Vanir gods who join the Æsir as hostages after a war between Æsir and Vanir . The Vanir appear to have mainly been connected with cultivation and fertility and the Æsir were connected with power and war . In the Eddas , however , the word Æsir is used for [ male ] gods in general , while Asynjur is used for the goddesses in general . For example , in the poem Skírnismál , Freyr was called a \" Prince of the Æsir \" . In the Prose Edda , Njörðr was introduced as \" the third among the Æsir \" , and among the Asynjur , Freya is always listed second only to Frigg . In surviving tales , the origins of many of the Æsir are unexplained . In the ostensibly oldest stories , there are only Búri \\'s three sons : Odin and his brothers Vili and Vé . Odin \\'s sons by giantesses are counted as Æsir . Heimdallr and Ullr \\'s connection with the Æsir is not clearly mentioned . Loki is a jötunn ( apparently a cousin and foster-brother of Odin ) and Njörðr is a Vanir and his two children are hostages , but they are often ranked among the Æsir . Scholarly theories and interpretations Given the difference between their roles and emphases , some scholars have speculated that the interactions between the Æsir and the Vanir reflect the types of interaction that occurred between clans ( or social classes ) within Norse society at the time . In reality , however , the reverse was true ; the types of interaction that occurred between clans and classes reflected the types of interactions between the Æsir and the Vanir . According to another theory , the Vanir ( and the fertility cults associated with them ) may be more archaic than that of the more warlike Æsir , such that the mythical war may mirror a half-remembered religious conflict . This argument was first suggested in 1877 by Wilhelm Mannhardt . On a similar note , Marija Gimbutas argues that the Æsir and the Vanir represent the displacement of an indigenous Indo-European group by a tribe of warlike invaders as part of her Kurgan hypothesis . See her case in The Living Goddess for more details . Another historical theory is that the inter-pantheon interaction may be an apotheosis of the conflict between the Roman Kingdom and the Sabines . Finally , M . Eliade ( 1958 ) speculated that this conflict is actually a later version of an Indo-European myth concerning the conflict between and eventual integration of a pantheon of sky / warrior / ruler gods and a pantheon of earth / economics / fertility gods , with no strict historical antecedents . List of Æsir The Prose Edda lists both male and female gods of the Æsir , in the 34th and 35th passages of the Gylfaginning . The Gylfaginning does not include Odin or Loki in this portion , perhaps considering them outside the ranking . ( 21 . ) Thor is the foremost of them . He is called Asa-Thor , or Oku-Thor . He is the strongest of all gods and men , and rules over the realm which is called Þrúðvangr . ( 22 . ) Odin \\'s second son is Baldr ( 23 . ) the third asa is he who is called Njörðr . ( 24 . ) Njörðr , in Noatun , afterward begat two children : a son , by name Freyr , and a daughter , by name Freyja . They were fair of face , and mighty . Freyr is arguably the most famous of the asas . He rules over rain and sunshine , and over the fruits of the earth . It is good to call on him for harvests and peace . He also sways the wealth of men . Freyja is the most famous of the goddesses . ... ( 25 . ) There is yet an asa , whose name is Týr . He is very daring and stout-hearted . He sways victory in war , wherefore warriors should call on him . ( 26 . ) Bragi is the name of another of the asas . He is famous for his wisdom , eloquence and flowing speech . ( 27 . ) Heimdallr is the name of one . He is also called the white-asa . He is great and holy ; born of nine maidens , all of whom were sisters . He is also called Hallinskide and Gullintanne , for his teeth were of gold . ( 28 . ) Höðr hight one of the asas , who is blind , but exceedingly strong ; and the gods would wish that this asa never needed to be named , for the work of his hand will long be kept in memory both by gods and men . ( 29 . ) Víðarr is the name of the silent asa . He has a very thick shoe , and he is the strongest next after Thor . From him the gods have much help in all hard tasks . ( 30 . ) Váli , is the son of Odin and Rindr . He is daring in combat , and a good shot . ( 31 . ) Ullr is the name of one , who is a son of Sif , and a step-son of Thor . He is so good an archer , and so fast on his skis , that no one can contend with him . He is fair of face , and possesses every quality of a warrior . Men should invoke him in single combat . ( 32 . ) Forseti is a son of Baldr and Nanna , Nep \\'s daughter . He has in heaven the hall which hight Glitner . All who come to him with disputes go away perfectly reconciled . Just to listen to People \\'s Future . No better tribunal is to be found among gods and men . ... ( 33 . ) There is yet one who is numbered among the asas , but whom some call the backbiter of the asas . He is the originator of deceit , and the disgrace of all gods and men . His name is Loki , or Lopt . ... His wife hight Sigyn , and their son , Nare , or Narfe . Corresponding to the fourteen Æsir listed above , section 35 lists fourteen asynjur ( goddesses ) : \" Ganglere asked : Which are the goddesses ? Har answered : \" Frigg is the first ; she possesses the right lordly dwelling which is called Fensaler . The second is Sága , who dwells in Sokvabek , and this is a large dwelling . The third is Eir , who is a goddess of medicine and medical care . The fourth is Gefjon , who is a may , and those who die maids become her hand-maidens . The fifth is Fulla , who is also a may , she wears her hair flowing and has a golden ribbon about her head ; she carries Frigg \\'s chest , takes care of her shoes and knows her secrets . The sixth is Freyja , who is ranked with Frigg . She is wedded to the man whose name is Oder ; their daughter \\'s name is Hnos , and she is so fair that all things fair and precious are called , from her name , Hnos . Oder went far away . Freyja weeps for him , but her tears are red gold . Freyja has many names , and the reason therefor is that she changed her name among the various nations to which she came in search of Oder . She is called Mardol , Horn , Gefn , and Syr . She has the necklace Brising , and she is called Vanadis . The seventh is Sjöfn , who is fond of turning men \\'s and women \\'s hearts to love , and it is from her name that love is called Sjafne . The eighth is Lofn , who is kind and good to those who call upon her , and she has permission from Alfather or Frigg to bring together men and women , no matter what difficulties may stand in the way ; therefore \" love \" is so called from her name , and also that which is much loved by men . The ninth is Var . She hears the oaths and troths that men and women plight to each other . Hence such vows are called vars , and she takes vengeance on those who break their promises . The tenth is Vör , who is so wise and searching that nothing can be concealed from her . It is a saying that a woman becomes vor ( ware ) of what she becomes wise . The eleventh is Syn , who guards the door of the hall , and closes it against those who are not to enter . In trials she guards those suits in which anyone tries to make use of falsehood . Hence is the saying that \" syn is set against it , \" when anyone tries to deny ought . The twelfth is Hlín , who guards those men whom Frigg wants to protect from any danger . Hence is the saying that he hlins who is forewarned . The thirteenth is Snotra , who is wise and courtly . After her , men and women who are wise are called Snotras . The fourteenth is Gna , whom Frigg sends on her errands into various worlds . She rides upon a horse called Hofvarpner , that runs through the air and over the sea . Once , when she was riding , some vanir saw her faring through the air . ... Sól and Bil are numbered among the goddesses , but their nature has already been described . The A-rune The a-rune , ansuz , , Younger Futhark ᚬ , was probably named after the Æsir . The name in this sense survives only in the Icelandic Rune Poem as Óss , referring to Óðinn , who is identified with Jupiter : { | |+ Icelandic Rune Poem |- style= \" vertical-align : bottom ; \" ! ! ! |- | Óss er algingautr ok ásgarðs jöfurr , ok valhallar vísi . Jupiter oddviti . | | \" Óss is Aged Gautr and prince of Asgard and lord of Valhalla chieftain Jupiter . \" | } The name of a in the Gothic alphabet is ahsa . The common Germanic name of the rune may thus have either been ansuz \" God , one of the Æsir \" , or ahsam \" ear ( of corn ) \" Asleikr The personal names Old Norse Ásleikr ( Latinised as Ansleicus ) , Old English Óslác ( modern \" Hasluck \" ) and Old High German Ansleh may continue the term for a sacrificial performance for the gods in early Germanic paganism ( ) . Grimm \\'s Deutsches Wörterbuch ( s.v . \" Leich \" ) compares * laikom to the meaning of Greek , denoting first the ceremonial procession to the sacrifice , but also ritual dance and hymns pertaining to religious ritual . Paul Herrman ( 1906 ) identified as such * ansulaikom the victory songs of the Batavi after defeating Quintus Petillius Cerialis in the Revolt of the Batavi in the year 69 CE according to Tacitus \\' account , and also the \" nefarious song \" accompanied by \" running in a circle \" around the head of a decapitated goat sacrificed to ( he presumes ) Wodan ( Odin ) , sung by the Lombards at their victory celebration in 579 CE . Personal names Gothic has Ansila and Ansemund . Theophoric names of the Anglo-Saxons containing the os element : Osburh , Oslac , Oswiu , Oswin ( e ) , Osbert , Oswudu , Osred , Oslaf , Øsa ( with i-mutation from a presumed * ós-i- ) , and Osgar ( Anglo-Saxon form of Ásgeir ) . These names were notably popular in the dynasty of Bernicia . Still in wide use are the surnames Osborn , Osgood , Osmund , and Oswald . As occurs in many Scandinavian given names : Asbjørn , Asgeir ( Asger , Asker ) , Asmund , Astrid , Asdîs , Asgautr , Aslaug , Åse , etc . Old High German had Anso , Anselm , Ansgar , Anshilt , Anspald , and Ansnôt , and Lombardic has Answald and Ansprand . As also occurs in some English names . In 874 , King Asketil was one of four Viking nobles who sacked Repton , the capital of Mercia , England . As \\'ketil \\' means \\'cauldron \\' ( whence the English word \\'kettle \\' is derived ) , his name means \\'God \\'s cauldron \\' . The English surname Astle is derived from his name ; however , it is not related to the name Astley . Less common alternative spellings of Astle include Astel , Astell , Astill , Astyll and Astull . Ásatrú Ásatrú , a kind of Heathenry whose name means \" faith in the Æsir \" , is a new religious movement of polytheistic reconstructionism based on Norse paganism . As of 2007 , Ásatrú is a religion officially recognized by the governments of Denmark , Iceland , Norway , and Sweden . Most adherents do not emphasize worship of the Æsir in particular and refer to their practice as \" Forn sed / sidr / siður \" meaning old customs . The Icelandic Ásatrúarfélagið describes Ásatrú as \" Nordic pantheism \" involving \" belief in the Icelandic / Nordic folklore \" including all the \" spirits and entities \" besides \" gods and other beings \" this entails .

Rearhand in a 3-player game , the player with least priority , e.g . the last to bid or play , in practice the dealer . In a 4-player game , the player following middlehand and who is the third to bid or play . Sometimes also called endhand . Roles Players may also be referred to by their roles as follows : Active player a player who receives cards in the current deal and is not sitting out temporarily because a ) there are more players than the game is designed for , or b ) they have withdrawn due to poor cards Adversary an opponent ( q.v . ) Captain in certain team games , the player who collects information from his teammate ( s ) and directs the tactics . Cutter the player whose is entitled to cut the cards ; usually the opposite side of the dealer to forehand ( or eldest/elder hand ) . Dealer the person who distributes or deals the cards to players in a card game.Dealer at dictionary.cambridge.org . Retrieved 4 August 2018 Declarer the highest bidder , who declares and then strives to make good the stated contract . Defender a player who plays against the declarer , usually with other defenders . Opponent a player of the opposing side ; a defender ( q.v ) ; or any other player in a round game . Partner a player who plays co-operatively in a team and who shares the winnings or losses . Partnerships may be fixed for the whole session or vary from deal to deal . Soloist a player who plays a Solo game , i.e . plays alone , as the declarer , against 2 or more other defenders . Dealing Choice of dealer In most card games , the role of dealer rotates , either clockwise or anticlockwise . The first dealer may be decided in one of several ways : The youngest player is invited to deal first The first dealer is chosen by lot i.e . players draw cards from a shuffled pack and the player with the highest card deals first ( e.g . Schafkopf , Poker ) The first dealer is chosen by lot i.e . players draw cards from a shuffled pack and the player with the lowest card deals first ( e.g . Whist ) In casinos , the dealer is always the house banker for obvious reasons . Distribution The distribution of the cards is conducted by the dealer in accordance with the game rules . The dealer may deal the cards one at a time , or in groups or packets , as indicated by the rules . In some games , all cards are dealt , while in other versions , some cards are left undistributed and are placed – or stacked – in the centre of the table as a talon or widow . The cards distributed to a player are known as the player \\'s \" hand \" . Normally the dealer shuffles the cards and then hands the pack to a player to cut it , who then lifts at least three cards from the pack . In games where the deal is clockwise , this player will be on the right of the dealer ; however , if the deal is anti-clockwise , this player is on the left of the dealer . The dealer generally distributes cards to each player individually or in packets in the direction of play , beginning with eldest hand , also known as forehand . The cards are dealt face-down in front of the players , and the dealer places any left-over cards face-down in the centre of the table . Other duties The duties of a dealer differ from game to game . Their job usually involves distributing cards for games such as poker , contract bridge , blackjack , roulette or skat but may also involve other duties , for example : Contract bridge : the dealer is an opener who opens the auction and makes the first call , after which the auction progresses clockwise . In poker , the dealer controls the action during a hand and manages the pot . In blackjack , a player plays against a dealer , or \" house \" . If the hand of a player is closer to 21 than the dealer \\'s , without going over , the player wins . In a three-player skat game , the dealer takes on the role of rearhand . The player sitting on the left of the dealer is called the \\'forehand \\' , and the player sitting to the dealer \\'s right is called middlehand . Casino dealers Casino dealers must have a comprehensive and accurate knowledge of the games for which they deal . They should know the rules of the different card games , understand the odds of winning in various situations , and they must be able to communicate this information correctly to all levels of players . It is also the responsibility of the dealer to watch the play carefully and check to make sure that no one is cheating .

Card game terminology', 'The Latin phrase ( meaning \" outside the Church [ there is ] no salvation \" or \" no salvation outside the Church \" ) is a phrase referring to a Christian doctrine about who is to receive salvation . The expression comes from the writings of Saint Cyprian of Carthage , a Christian bishop of the 3rd century . The phrase is an axiom often used as shorthand for the doctrine that the Church is necessary for salvation . It is a dogma in the Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church , in reference to their own communions . It is also held by many historic Protestant churches . However , Protestants , Catholics and the Eastern Orthodox each have a unique ecclesiological understanding of what constitutes \\'the Church \\' . For some , the church is defined as \" all those who will be saved \" , with no emphasis on the visible church . For others , the theological basis for this doctrine is founded on the beliefs that Jesus Christ personally established the one Church , and that the Church serves as the means by which the graces won by Christ are communicated to believers . Kallistos Ware , a Greek Eastern Orthodox bishop , has expressed this doctrine as follows : The 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church explained this as \" all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is His Body . \" The Catholic Church also teaches that the doctrine does not mean that everyone who is not visibly within the Church is necessarily damned in case of inculpable ignorance . Some of the most clear Catholic expressions of this dogma are : the profession of faith of Pope Innocent III ( 1208 ) , the profession of faith of the Fourth Lateran Council ( 1215 ) , the papal bull of Pope Boniface VIII ( 1302 ) , and the profession of faith of the Council of Florence ( 1442 ) . The axiom \" No salvation outside the Church \" has been frequently repeated over the centuries in different terms by the ordinary magisterium , with the positive formulation of the dogma being laid out most recently in of the Second Vatican Council , as well as in the declaration of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith , , which was published under the direction of cardinal Ratzinger and appoved by John Paul II , which restated the Catholic belief that the Catholic Church is \" the one true Church \" . Scriptural foundation The doctrine is based largely on Mark 16:15-16 : History First use of the sentence The original phrase , ( \" there is no salvation out of the Church \" ) , comes from Letter LXXII of Cyprian of Carthage ( died 258 ) . The letter was written in reference to a particular controversy as to whether it was necessary to baptize applicants who had been previously baptized by heretics . In , Cyprian tells Jubaianus of his conviction that baptism conferred by heretics is not valid . Firmilian ( died ) agreed with Cyprian , reasoning that those who are outside the Church and do not have the Holy Spirit can not admit others to the Church or give what they do not possess . According to cardinal Ratzinger , Cyprian was not expressing a theory on the eternal fate of all baptized and non-baptized persons . Early Church Fathers The concept was also referred to by Origen in his Homilies on Joshua , but neither he nor Cyprian were addressing non-Christians , but those already baptized and in danger of leaving the faith , as that would involve apostasy . Earlier , Justin Martyr had indicated that the righteous Jews who lived before Christ would be saved . He later expressed a similar opinion concerning Gentiles . Those who act pleasing to God , while not \" being \" Christian are yet in some sense \" in \" Christ the Logos .... Each one , ... shall be saved by his own righteousness , ... those who regulated their lives by the law of Moses would in like manner be saved . ... Since those who did that which is universally , naturally , and eternally good are pleasing to God , they shall be saved through this Christ in the resurrection equally with those righteous men who were before them , namely Noah , and Enoch , and Jacob , and whoever else there be , along with those who have known this Christ . Irenaeus ( died 202 AD ) wrote : \" One should not seek among others the truth that can be easily gotten from the Church . For in her , as in a rich treasury , the apostles have placed all that pertains to truth , so that everyone can drink this beverage of life . She is the door of life \" ( Irenaeus of Lyons , Against Heresies , III.4 ) . However , he also said : \" For it was not merely for those who believed on Him in the time of Tiberius Caesar that Christ came , nor did the Father exercise His providence for the men only who are now alive , but for all men altogether , who from the beginning , according to their capacity , in their generation have both feared and loved God , and practised justice and piety towards their neighbours , and have earnestly desired to see Christ , and to hear His voice . \" Irenaeus recognized that all who feared and loved God , practiced justice and piety toward their neighbors , and desired to see Christ , insofar as they were able to do so , would be saved . Since many were not able to have an explicit desire to see Christ , but only an implicit one , Iranaeus held the view that this would be satisfactory for salvation . Gregory of Nazianzus took a rather broad view in his understanding of membership in the body of Christ . In the funeral oration for his father \\'s death in 374 , Gregory stated : \" He was ours even before he was of our fold . His manner of life made him one of us . Just as there are many of our own who are not with us , whose lives alienate them from the common body , so too there are many of those outside who belong really to us , men whose devout conduct anticipates their faith . They lack only the name of that which in fact they possess . My father was one of these , an alien shoot but inclined to us in his manner of life . \" In other words , by their charity of life , they are united to Christians in Christ , even before they explicitly believe in Christ . Fulgentius of Ruspe took a much stricter view : \" Most firmly hold and never doubt that not only pagans , but also all Jews , all heretics , and all schismatics who finish this life outside of the Catholic Church , will go into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels . \" Jerome wrote : \" This is the ark of Noah , and he who is not found in it shall perish when the flood prevails . \" Bede continues this theme : \" And according to this sense the ark is manifestly the Church , Noah the Lord who builds the Church . \" Thomas Aquinas Peter Canisius and Robert Bellarmine ( ) also used the image of the life-saving ark as a representation of the Church . Augustine of Hippo made numerous remarks in response to adversaries , often on opposite sides of this issue , once saying : \" Whoever is without the Church will not be reckoned among the sons , and whoever does not want to have the Church as mother will not have God as father . \" He could also pick up on the sayings of the Fathers , and be completely inclusive in his assessment : \" All together we are members of Christ and are his body ... throughout the world ... from Abel the just until the end of time ... whoever among the just made his passage throughout this life , whether now ... or in the generations to come , all the just are this one body of Christ , and individually his members . \" Catholic teachings Pope Pelagius II ( died 590 ) : \" Consider the fact that whoever has not been in the peace and unity of the Church can not have the Lord ... Although given over to flames and fires , they burn , or , thrown to wild beasts , they lay down their lives , there will not be ( for them ) that crown of faith but the punishment of faithlessness . …Such a one can be slain , he can not be crowned . … [ If ] slain outside the Church , he can not attain the rewards of the Church . \" Pope Gregory I ( died 604 ) in ( \" An Extensive Consideration of Moral Questions \" ) said : \" Now the holy Church universal proclaims that God can not be truly worshiped saving within herself , asserting that all they that are without her shall never be saved . \" Pope Gregory XVI later quoted his predecessor in his 1832 encyclical ( \" on mixed religious marriages \" ) . Pope Leo XII , ( # 14 , May 5 , 1824 ) : \" It is impossible for the most true God , who is Truth itself , the best , the wisest Provider , and the Rewarder of good men , to approve all sects who profess false teachings which are often inconsistent with one another and contradictory , and to confer eternal rewards on their members… by divine faith we hold one Lord , one faith , one baptism , and that no other name under heaven is given to men except the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth in which we must be saved . This is why we profess that there is no salvation outside the Church . \" Bishop John Carroll ( died 1815 ) , the first bishop in the United States , recognized a distinction between being in communion with the Church and being a member thereof : To be in the communion of the Catholic Church and to be a member of the Church are two different things . They are in the communion of profession of her faith and participation of her sacraments , through the ministry and government of her lawful pastors . The members of the Catholic Church are all those who with a sincere heart seek the true religion and are in unfeigned disposition to embrace the truth wherever they find it . It never was our doctrine that salvation can be obtained only by the former . Carroll traces this analysis back to Augustine of Hippo . Francis Cardinal Bourne , Archbishop of Westminster from 1903–1935 , summarized the Church teaching as follows : If God the Creator speaks , the creature is bound to listen and to believe what He utters . Hence the axiom \" outside the Church there is no salvation \" . But , as it is equally true that without the deliberate act of the will there can be neither fault nor sin , so evidently this axiom applies only to those who are outside the Church knowingly , deliberately , and wilfully . …And this is the doctrine of the Catholic Church on this often misunderstood and misrepresented aphorism . There are the covenanted and the uncovenanted dealings of God with His creatures , and no creature is outside His fatherly care . There are millions – even at this day the vast majority of mankind – who are still unreached or unaffected by the message of Christianity in any shape or form . There are large numbers who are persuaded that the old covenant still prevails and are perfectly sincere and conscientious in their observance of the Jewish Law . And there are millions who accept some fashion of Christian teaching who have never adverted to the idea of Unity as I have described it , and have no thought that they are obliged in conscience to accept the teaching and to submit to the authority of the Catholic Church . All such , whether separated wholly from acceptance of Christ and His teaching , or accepting that teaching only to the extent in which they have perceived it , will be judged on their own merits . Pope Pius XII ( 1939–1958 ) , allocution to the Gregorian University ( 17 October 1953 ) : \" By divine mandate the interpreter and guardian of the Scriptures , and the depository of Sacred Tradition living within her , the Church alone is the entrance to salvation : She alone , by herself , and under the protection and guidance of the Holy Spirit , is the source of truth . \" Councils Fourth Lateran Council ( 1215 ) : \" There is but one universal Church of the faithful , outside which no one at all is saved . \" Council of Florence , Cantate Domino ( 1441 ) : \" The most Holy Roman Church firmly believes , professes and preaches that none of those existing outside the Catholic Church , not only pagans , but also Jews and heretics and schismatics , can have a share in life eternal ; but that they will go into the \\'eternal fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels \\' ( Matthew 25:41 ) , unless before death they are joined with Her ; and that so important is the unity of this ecclesiastical body that only those remaining within this unity can profit by the sacraments of the Church unto salvation , and they alone can receive an eternal recompense for their fasts , their almsgivings , their other works of Christian piety and the duties of a Christian soldier . No one , let his almsgiving be as great as it may , no one , even if he pour out his blood for the Name of Christ , can be saved , unless he remain within the bosom and the unity of the Catholic Church . \" The same council also ruled that those who die in original sin , but without mortal sin , will also find punishment in hell , but unequally : \" But the souls of those who depart this life in actual mortal sin , or in original sin alone , go down straightaway to hell to be punished , but with unequal pains . \" Encyclicals Pope Boniface VIII \\'s bull of 1302 was promulgated during an ongoing dispute between Boniface VIII and Philip IV of France . In it , Boniface declared , \" We are compelled in virtue of our faith to believe and maintain that there is only one holy Catholic Church , and that one is apostolic . This we firmly believe and profess without qualification . Outside this Church there is no salvation and no remission of sins . \" The bull notably extends what had been ecclesiastical dictum into relations with temporal powers . According to Robert W . Dyson , there are some who hold that Giles of Rome might have been the actual writer of the bull . It is notable for the claim , \" We declare , say , define , and pronounce that it is absolutely necessary for the salvation of every human creature to be subject to the Roman Pontiff . \" Pope Leo XII in his 1824 encyclical in discussing religious indifferentism , said : \" A certain sect , which you surely know , has unjustly arrogated to itself the name of philosophy , and has aroused from the ashes the disorderly ranks of practically every error . Under the gentle appearance of piety and liberality this sect professes what they call tolerance or indifferentism . It preaches that not only in civil affairs , which is not Our concern here , but also in religion , God has given every individual a wide freedom to embrace and adopt without danger to his salvation whatever sect or opinion appeals to him on the basis of his private judgment . \" Pope Pius IX wrote a number of times against religious indifferentism . In the 1863 encyclical he said , \" And here , beloved Sons and Venerable Brothers , We should mention again and censure a very grave error in which some Catholics are unhappily engaged , who believe that men living in error , and separated from the true faith and from Catholic unity , can attain eternal life . Indeed , this is certainly quite contrary to Catholic teaching . It is known to Us and to you that they who labor in invincible ignorance of our most holy religion and who , zealously keeping the natural law and its precepts engraved in the hearts of all by God , and being ready to obey God , live an honest and upright life , can , by the operating power of divine light and grace , attain eternal life , since God who clearly beholds , searches , and knows the minds , souls , thoughts , and habits of all men , because of His great goodness and mercy , will by no means suffer anyone to be punished with eternal torment who has not the guilt of deliberate sin . But , the Catholic dogma that no one can be saved outside the Catholic Church is well-known ; and also that those who are obstinate toward the authority and definitions of the same Church , and who persistently separate themselves from the unity of the Church , and from the Roman Pontiff , the successor of Peter , to whom \\'the guardianship of the vine has been entrusted by the Savior \\' ( Council of Chalcedon , Letter to Pope Leo I ) can not obtain eternal salvation ... \" Pope Pius XI saw the ecumenical movement of the early 20th century \" as nothing else than a Federation , composed of various communities of Christians , even though they adhere to different doctrines , which may even be incompatible one with another . \" In his 1928 encyclical , he quotes from Lactantius : \" The Catholic Church alone is keeping the true worship . This is the font of truth , this is the house of faith , this is the temple of God ; if any man enter not here , or if any man go forth from it , he is a stranger to the hope of life and salvation . …Furthermore , in this one Church of Christ , no man can be or remain who does not accept , recognize and obey the authority and supremacy of Peter and his legitimate successors . \" Second Vatican Council In calling the Second Vatican Council , Pope John XXIII noted a distinction between the truths of faith and how those truths are conveyed . In the 1973 declaration , the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith recognized that the articulation of revealed truth would necessarily be influenced by historical factors . The Second Vatican Council declared that the Christian communities that are not in full communion , but only in \" partial communion \" with the Catholic Church , \" though we believe them to be deficient in some respects , have been by no means deprived of significance and importance in the mystery of salvation . For the Spirit of Christ has not refrained from using them as means of salvation which derive their efficacy from the very fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the Church . \" It explained that \" some and even very many of the significant elements and endowments which together go to build up and give life to the Church itself , can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic Church : the written word of God ; the life of grace ; faith , hope and charity , with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit , and visible elements too . All of these , which come from Christ and lead back to Christ , belong by right to the one Church of Christ . \" These elements , it said , \" as gifts belonging to the Church of Christ , are forces impelling toward Catholic unity . \" The Council identified Christ \\'s Church on earth with the Catholic Church , saying : \" This Church constituted and organized in the world as a society , subsists in the Catholic Church . \" The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated in a later doctrinal note that the term \" subsistit in \" and \" is \" are interchangeable , so that the \" one true Church \" is and subsists in the Catholic Church , according to Catholic teaching . The Second Vatican Council also declared that \" it is through Christ \\'s Catholic Church alone , which is the universal help towards salvation , that the fullness of the means of salvation can be obtained . It was to the apostolic college alone , of which Peter is the head , that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant , in order to establish on earth the one body of Christ into which all those must be fully incorporated who belong in any way to the people of God . \" In its decree on missionary activity , the Council , quoting , 14 , said : \" Christ Himself \\'by stressing in express language the necessity of faith and baptism ( cf . Mark 16:16 ; John 3:5 ) , at the same time confirmed the necessity of the Church , into which men enter by baptism , as by a door .... \\' Therefore though God in ways known to Himself can lead those inculpably ignorant of the Gospel to find that faith without which it is impossible to please Him , yet a necessity lies upon the Church , and at the same time a sacred duty , to preach the Gospel . \" The Council also warned that full incorporation in the Church does not ensure salvation : \" They are fully incorporated in the society of the Church who , possessing the Spirit of Christ accept her entire system and all the means of salvation given to her , and are united with her as part of her visible bodily structure and through her with Christ , who rules her through the Supreme Pontiff and the bishops . The bonds which bind men to the Church in a visible way are profession of faith , the sacraments , and ecclesiastical government and communion . He is not saved , however , who , though part of the body of the Church , does not persevere in charity . He remains indeed in the bosom of the Church , but , as it were , only in a \\'bodily \\' manner and not \\'in his heart \\' . All the Church \\'s children should remember that their exalted status is to be attributed not to their own merits but to the special grace of Christ . If they fail moreover to respond to that grace in thought , word and deed , not only shall they not be saved but they will be the more severely judged . \" < ref name=AG14 > Lumen gentium , 14 < /ref > Second Vatican Council , Dogmatic Constitution , 14 : \" They could not be saved who , knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ , would refuse either to enter it , or to remain in it . \" Second Vatican Council , Dogmatic Constitution , 16 : \" Nor is God far distant from those who in shadows and images seek the unknown God , for it is He who gives to all men life and breath and all things , and as Saviour wills that all men be saved . Those also can attain to salvation who through no fault of their own do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Church , yet sincerely seek God and moved by grace strive by their deeds to do His will as it is known to them through the dictates of conscience . Nor does Divine Providence deny the helps necessary for salvation to those who , without blame on their part , have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God and with His grace strive to live a good life . \" The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that the phrase , \" Outside the Church there is no salvation \" , means , if put in positive terms , that \" all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body \" , and it \" is not aimed at those who , through no fault of their own , do not know Christ and his Church \" . At the same time , it adds : \" Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who , through no fault of their own , are ignorant of the Gospel to that faith without which it is impossible to please him , the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men . \" The Church has also declared that \" she is joined in many ways to the baptized who are honored by the name of Christian , but do not profess the Catholic faith in its entirety or have not preserved unity or communion under the successor of Peter \" , and that \" those who have not yet received the Gospel are related to the People of God in various ways . \" The 2000 declaration of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith states that \" it must be firmly believed that the Church , a pilgrim now on earth , is necessary for salvation : the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation ; he is present to us in his body which is the Church . He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and baptism ( cf . Mk 16:16 ; Jn 3:5 ) , and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through baptism as through a door . \" It then adds that \" for those who are not formally and visibly members of the Church , salvation in Christ is accessible by virtue of a grace which , while having a mysterious relationship to the Church , does not make them formally part of the Church , but enlightens them in a way which is accommodated to their spiritual and material situation . This grace comes from Christ ; it is ... communicated by the Holy Spirit ; it has a relationship with the Church , which , according to the plan of the Father , has her origin in the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit . \" Inculpable ignorance In its statements regarding this doctrine , the Church expressly teaches that \" it is necessary to hold for certain that they who labor in ignorance of the true religion , if this ignorance is invincible , will not be held guilty of this in the eyes of God \" ; that \" outside of the Church , nobody can hope for life or salvation unless he is excused through ignorance beyond his control \" ; and that \" they who labor in invincible ignorance of our most holy religion and who , zealously keeping the natural law and its precepts engraved in the hearts of all by God , and being ready to obey God , live an honest and upright life , can , by the operating power of divine light and grace , attain eternal life . \" \" Inculpable or invincible ignorance has never been and will never be a means of salvation . To be saved , it is necessary to be justified , or to be in the state of sanctifying grace . To obtain sanctifying grace , it is necessary to have the proper dispositions for justification ; that is , true divine faith in at least the necessary truths of salvation , confident hope in the divine Savior , sincere sorrow for sin , together with the firm purpose of doing all that God has commanded , etc . Now , these supernatural acts of faith , hope , charity , contrition , etc. , which prepare the soul for receiving sanctifying grace , can never be supplied by invincible ignorance ; ... But if we say that inculpable ignorance can not save a man , we thereby do not say that invincible ignorance damns a man . Far from it . To say , invincible ignorance is no means of salvation , is one thing ; and to say , invincible ignorance is the cause of damnation , is another . To maintain the latter would be wrong , for inculpable ignorance of the fundamental principles of faith excuses a heathen from the sin of infidelity , and a Protestant from the sin of heresy ; because such invincible ignorance , being only a simple involuntary privation , is no sin . \" ( Michael Müller , Invincible or Inculpable Ignorance Neither Saves nor Damns a Person , Questions and Answers on Salvation by Rev . Michael Muller , C.SS.R ) Strict interpretation Some sedevacantists take a strictly literal point of view which is Feeneyism , holding that only baptized Catholics are saved . Among such groups are the Slaves of the Immaculate Heart of Mary of Richmond , New Hampshire and Most Holy Family Monastery . As they reject of concept of baptism by desire and baptism of blood , only a properly performed rite with the use of water and the requisite words is sufficient . Lutheran interpretation Martin Luther , the foremost leader of the Protestant Reformation , spoke of the necessity of belonging to the church ( in the sense of what he saw as the true church ) in order to be saved : Therefore he who would find Christ must first find the Church . How should we know where Christ and his faith were , if we did not know where his believers are ? And he who would know anything of Christ must not trust himself nor build a bridge to heaven by his own reason ; but he must go to the Church , attend and ask her . Now the Church is not wood and stone , but the company of believing people ; one must hold to them , and see how they believe , live and teach ; they surely have Christ in their midst . For outside of the Christian church there is no truth , no Christ , no salvation . Modern Lutheran churches \" do agree with the traditional statement that \\'outside the catholic church there is no salvation \\' , but this statement refers not to the Roman organization but to the Holy Christian Catholic and Apostolic Church , which consists of all who believe in Christ as their Savior . \" Reformed interpretation The Genevan reformer John Calvin , in his Reformation-era work Institutes of the Christian Religion , wrote : \" beyond the pale of the Church no forgiveness of sins , no salvation , can be hoped for \" . Calvin wrote also that \" those to whom He is a Father , the Church must also be a mother , \" echoing the words of the originator of the Latin phrase himself , Cyprian : \" He can no longer have God for his Father who has not the Church for his mother . \" Reformed scholastics accepted the phrase so long as the church is recognized by the marks of the church , which they defined as proper administration of the Word and sacrament , rather than apostolic succession . The idea is further affirmed in the Westminster Confession of Faith of 1647 that \" the visible Church ... is the Kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ , the house and family of God , out of which there is no ordinary possibility of salvation . \" Methodist interpretation The Methodist tradition , inclusive of the holiness movement , holds that the office of the keys is exercised when the Church baptizes an individual and pronounces them saved . The office of the keys is furthermore exercised in the Church \" binding and loosing \" , being able to excommunicate individuals from the sacraments as \" ordinarily , no one is saved outside the visible church \" . The purpose of this is to allow individuals to repent and come into full communion with the Church so that they might receive \" final salvation \" .

It is one of two prequels to the Foundation series . For the first time , Asimov chronicles the fictional life of Hari Seldon , the man who invented psychohistory and the intellectual hero of the series . The novel was nominated for the Locus Award . Plot summary Prelude to Foundation is set in the year 12,020 G.E . ( Galactic Era ) , during the rocky reign of the Emperor Cleon I . It starts with Seldon \\'s presentation of a paper at a mathematics convention detailing how psychohistory might theoretically make it possible to predict the future . The Emperor of the Galactic Empire learns of this and wants to use Seldon for political gain . In a face-to-face interview , Seldon emphasizes that psychohistory is something that he has not even begun developing or even has a clear idea how to do so , but Cleon is not wholly convinced that Hari is of no use to the Empire . Seldon then meets reporter Chetter Hummin , who convinces him that Cleon \\'s first minister , Eto Demerzel , is attempting to capture him , and that it is therefore imperative for Seldon to escape and try to make psychohistory practical . He is taken by Hummin to Streeling University , one of the top ranked of the Empire and introduced to Dors Venabili by Hummin . Seldon theorizes that the first development of psychohistory requires a smaller , yet still significant sample than the entire Empire , possibly just the original world where humans originated ... which is now lost , along with much of the older historical records . Hari and Dors narrowly evade capture at Streeling University , and Hummin arranges for them to be sheltered in the reclusive Mycogen sector , which supposedly values its ancient history . Seldon and Venabili are welcomed by Sunmaster Fourteen , the leader of Mycogen . Seldon obtains the Mycogenians \\' treasured religious/historical book , but finds it disappointing except for the revelation of what the Mycogenians call their home planet , Aurora , and references to \" robots \" ( which do not exist in the Empire ) . Seldon and Venabili face execution when Seldon insists on entering the Mycogenian \" temple \" , the Sacratorium , in disguise in hopes of interviewing a robot supposedly housed there . They are easily detected , but Hummin arrives in the nick of time to save them . The action then shifts to the Dahl sector , where Seldon and Venabili rent rooms from a middle-class family . While in Dahl , they meet a guttersnipe named Raych , whom Seldon later adopts . Also in Dahl , they are told by an old wise woman that the Aurora of the Mycogenians is not the original world , but actually the \" enemy \" of the original human planet , called Earth . ( This links with the Robot series . ) Towards the end of the novel , Seldon , Venabili , and Raych are kidnapped and forcibly taken to see Rashelle , who is the Mayor of Wye , a powerful and vital sector situated at Trantor \\'s south pole . Rashelle and her father have long been plotting to overthrow the Emperor and take his place . Seldon has the revelation that he could try to develop psychohistory using Trantor itself as a test case because of the great cultural diversity of its sectors . Rashelle launches her coup attempt , but it quickly collapses due to Demerzel \\'s skillful subversion of Wye \\'s forces . The finale reveals that \" Hummin \" is actually Eto Demerzel . Seldon then gets Demerzel to admit he is a robot ; Demerzel is in fact R . Daneel Olivaw , who can influence humans mentally . He wants the development of psychohistory to help him better protect humanity , as per \" The Zeroth Law Of Robotics \" . Seldon also suspects Venabili of being a robot , as well .

Plot summary A Hat Full of Sky by Terry Pratchett is a fantasy novel about a girl who is learning her place as a witch . Early in the novel , Tiffany Aching leaves her home in the chalk country ( based on England \\'s chalk country ) to act as an apprentice and maid for the elderly witch Miss Level . Her former teacher , Miss Tick , who is also a witch , escorts her to the town of Twoshirts . While waiting for Miss Level to arrive , they are attacked by a hiver . The hiver can not be killed or seen and it takes over your mind . The encounter is only for a few seconds , and then the hiver leaves but it gives Tiffany and Miss Tick a fright . Miss Level comes along on a broomstick and takes Tiffany to her cottage in the mountains . After settling in Tiffany discovers that Miss Level has two bodies and she has a spirit named Oswald who cleans her house . After settling into the cottage , Tiffany goes to a group of apprentice witches her age with Petulia . The leader of the group is called Annagramma and many characters find her condescending and rude . Tiffany leaves the group upset after telling them about her imaginary hat .

At first Tiffany does n\\'t realize what has happened , but when she does , it is too late for her to take action . The hiver ( as Tiffany ) causes chaos , steals Mr Weavall \\'s money and causes Annagramma to fear her . Upon arrival at the cottage , the hiver kills one of Miss Level \\'s bodies . Rob Anybody who is one of the Nac Mac Feegle ( which are fairies that are very loyal to Tiffany after she previously helped them ) goes into Tiffany \\'s mind along with some of his friends to try to fight the hiver out of her mind . They decide that smells from her past will bring forth the actual Tiffany and she will be able to break free . With the help of the Nac Mac Feegle , Tiffany fights the hiver out of her mind , but she is still left with the memories of previous victims of the hiver . Mr . Weavall discovers that Tiffany stole his money , but the Feegles put gold in place of the copper he had saved up . Tiffany decides that the hiver must be dealt with so she proceeds to pursue it in the mountains . Mistress Weatherwax accompanies her although Tiffany is begrudging . They camp in the mountains and Mistress Weatherwax borrows an owl \\'s mind to observe the hiver as it lurks close by . Mistress Weatherwax tells Tiffany to call her Granny Weatherwax . In the morning Tiffany and Mistress Weatherwax head off to the witch trials , an annual event where witches show what they have learned . Upon arrival , Tiffany senses the hiver moving in on her and turns to Granny Weatherwax only to find that she is n\\'t there . Panicking , she runs until she finds Granny Weatherwax who tells her it is time to face the hiver alone . Tiffany welcomes the hiver to her mind , and discovers that the hiver does n\\'t understand humans , it just wants to seek shelter from the world because it senses everything . Tiffany names the hiver Arthur and teaches it how to die which is its ultimate goal . She shows it the way across the desert to death . As she turns to exit the world of death , she finds that the door she entered has disappeared . Turning back around , Death confronts her but she is rescued by Granny Weatherwax .

One player is chosen as the Oni ( literally demon or ogre , but similar to the concept of \" it \" in tag ) and sits blindfolded ( or with their eyes covered ) . The other children join hands and walk in circles around the Oni while chanting the song for the game . When the song stops , the Oni tries to name the person standing directly behind them . The song is a subject of much interest because of its cryptic lyrics which vary from region to region , and many theories exist about its meaning , but neither have been definitively explained . Melody Lyrics In Japanese , the song has different lyrics depending on the region , but the most commonly known version is : The most common interpretation is : Kagome kagome / The bird in the basket/cage , When , oh when will it come out In the night of dawn The crane and turtle slipped Who is behind you now ? As the song is typically written in a single line without any punctuation , in addition to the odd phrasing and ambiguous words , it is also unclear which phrases are connected to which ( For example , \" In the night of dawn \" could be an answer to \" when oh when will it come out \" , or could be a setting for \" the crane and turtle slipped \" ) . Common variations in the song include replacing \" 夜明けの晩に \" ( \" yoake no ban ni/in the evening of the dawn \" ) with \" 夜明けの番人 \" ( \" yoake no bannin/the guard at/of dawn \" ) , and \" 後ろの正面 \" ( \" ushiro no shoumen/in front of behind \" ) with \" 後ろの少年 \" ( \" ushiro no shounen/the boy behind \" ) . There are countless variations in history , many of which can be found recorded in writing . Meaning Many theories surround the meanings of the various phrases in the song . These include : Kagome \" Kagome \" ( 籠目 ) : The holes in a basket A corruption of \" kakome \" ( \" surround \" ) The shape of the holes in a traditional basket , a hexagon The shape of the holes in a traditional , including the woven material , a hexagram \" Kagome \" ( 籠女 ) : A pregnant woman Kagome - a caged bird Kagome - \" Circle you \" Can also mean \" lost \" Kago no naka no tori wa As \" kago \" can mean both \" cage \" and \" basket \" , a bird in a basket would , by the standards of the age , be a chicken It is possible that \" tori \" is supposed to be a metaphor for torii , and that kago ( typically woven out of bamboo ) refers to a bamboo fence , and that thus the \" torii surrounded by bamboo \" is in fact a Shinto shrine . In the case that kagome is interpreted as \" pregnant woman \" , the bird in the cage is her unborn child . Itsu itsu deyaru Can also be \" itsu itsu deau \" ( \" When oh when will we meet \" ) Can mean \" When will it come out ? \" Can mean \" When can it come out ? \" Yoake no ban ni Can simply mean night Can mean \" from morning till night \" Can mean an inability to see light Can mean a period of time that can be taken as either dawn or night ( around 4 AM ) As \" yoake \" literally means the end of night , and \" ban \" can refer to both night or evening , this can be a purposeful contradiction referring to a time period that does not exist Tsuru to kame ga subetta The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of good fortune , and thus their slipping can mean the coming of misfortune The crane and turtle can be interpreted as symbols of long life , and thus their slipping can mean the coming of death \" Subetta \" can be taken to be \" 統べった \" or \" 統べた \" ( \" to rule over \" ) , in which case the crane and turtle symbolize a ruler Could be a corruption of a line from a Kyoto nursery rhyme , \" tsurutsuru tsuppaita \" Ushiro no shoumen daare Can simply mean \" who stands behind \" Can be taken to mean \" who is it that stands right in front when you look behind \" in a figurative manner , referring to hidden people in positions of power Can be taken to be something said by someone who has been beheaded , whose head is looking at his own back Can be taken to be something said by someone who is about to be beheaded , in which case the question \" who is it who stands behind me \" is in other words \" who is my executioner \" Theories The song is a subject of much academic interest and many theories surround its origin and meaning . Some such theories are : The lyrics refer to the game only In this theory the lyrics mean \" Surround , surround ( the Oni ) / When will the Oni be able to switch roles with the next person ? / Who is it standing behind you ? \" . The song is about a prostitute In this theory the lyrics refer to a woman forced into prostitution ( the bird in a cage ) who has seen so many men that she can not remember all of them ( \" who is it who stands behind \" refers to the next person in line ) and wonders when she will be able to escape ( when oh when will it escape ) . The song is about a pregnant woman In this theory the \" kagome \" is a pregnant woman . Someone pushes her down a flight of stairs ( \" tsuru to kame ga subetta \" ) and she miscarries , and wonders who killed her child ( \" ushiro no shoumen daare \" ) . The song is about a convict to be executed The \" kagome \" is a prison cell , and the bird is its prisoner . \" Tsuru to kame ga subetta \" symbolizes the end of life and fortune , and \" ushiro no shoumen daare \" is either the prisoner wondering who his executioner is , or his disembodied head gazing at his own body .

The premise of the sketch is that Abbott is identifying the players on a baseball team for Costello . However , the players \\' names can simultaneously serve as the basis for questions ( e.g. , \" Who is the first baseman ? \" ) and responses ( e.g. , \" The first baseman \\'s name is \" Who . \" ) , leading to repeated misinterpretations and growing frustration between the performers . History \" Who \\'s on First ? \" is descended from turn-of-the-century burlesque sketches that used plays on words and names . Examples are \" The Baker Scene \" ( the shop is located on Watt Street ) and \" Who Dyed \" ( the owner is named \" Who \" ) . In the 1930 movie Cracked Nuts , comedians Bert Wheeler and Robert Woolsey examine a map of a mythical kingdom with dialogue like this : \" What is next to Which . \" \" What is the name of the town next to Which ? \" \" Yes . \" In British music halls , comedian Will Hay performed a routine in the early 1930s ( and possibly earlier ) as a schoolmaster interviewing a schoolboy named Howe , who came from Ware , but now lives in Wye . By the early 1930s , a \" Baseball Routine \" had become a standard bit for burlesque comics across the United States . Abbott \\'s wife recalled him performing the routine with another comedian before teaming with Costello . Bud Abbott stated that it was taken from an older routine called \" Who \\'s The Boss ? \" , a performance of which can be heard in an episode of the radio comedy program It Pays to Be Ignorant from the 1940s . After they formally teamed up in burlesque in 1936 , he and Costello continued to hone the sketch . It was a big hit in the fall of 1937 , when they performed the routine in a touring vaudeville revue called Hollywood Bandwagon . In February 1938 , Abbott and Costello joined the cast of The Kate Smith Hour radio program , and the sketch was first performed for a national radio audience on March 24 of that year . The routine may have been further polished before this broadcast by burlesque producer John Grant , who became the team \\'s writer , and Will Glickman , a staff writer on the radio show . Glickman may have added the nicknames of then-contemporary baseball players like Dizzy and Daffy Dean to set up the routine \\'s premise . This version , with extensive wordplay based on the fact that most of the fictional baseball team \\'s players had \" strange nicknames \" that seemed to be questions , became known as \" Who \\'s on First ? \" Some versions continue with references to Enos Slaughter , which Costello misunderstands as \" He knows \" Slaughter . By 1944 , Abbott and Costello had the routine copyrighted . Abbott and Costello performed \" Who \\'s on First ? \" numerous times in their careers , rarely performing it exactly the same way twice . They did the routine for President Franklin Roosevelt several times . An abridged version was featured in the team \\'s 1940 film debut , One Night in the Tropics . The duo reprised the bit in their 1945 film The Naughty Nineties , and it is that longer version which is considered their finest recorded rendition . They also performed \" Who \\'s on First ? \" numerous times on radio and television ( notably in The Abbott and Costello Show episode \" The Actor \\'s Home \" , widely considered the definitive version ) . In 1956 , a gold record of \" Who \\'s on First ? \" was placed in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown , New York . A video ( taken from The Naughty Nineties ) now plays continuously on screens at the Hall . In the 1970s , Selchow and Righter published a \" Who \\'s on First ? \" board game . In 1999 , Time named the routine Best Comedy Sketch of the 20th Century . An early radio recording was placed in the Library of Congress \\'s National Recording Registry in 2003 . In 2005 , the line \" Who \\'s on First ? \" was included on the American Film Institute \\'s list of 100 memorable movie quotations . Sketch The names given in the routine for the players at each position are : The name of the shortstop is not given until the very end of the routine , and the right fielder is never identified . In the Selchow and Righter board game , the right fielder \\'s name is \" Nobody \" . At one point in the routine , Costello thinks that the first baseman is named \" Naturally \" : Abbott \\'s explanations leave Costello hopelessly confused and infuriated , until the end of the routine when Costello appears to parody Abbott by saying what appears to be gibberish to him , accidentally getting it right : That is the most commonly heard ending . \" I Do n\\'t Care \" and \" I Do n\\'t Give a Damn \" have also turned up on occasion , depending on the perceived sensibilities of the audience . ( The performance in the film The Naughty Nineties ends with \" I Do n\\'t Care . \" ) The skit was usually performed on the team \\'s radio series at the start of the baseball season . In one instance it serves as a climax for a broadcast which begins with Costello receiving a telegram from Joe DiMaggio asking Costello to take over for him due to his injury . ( In this case , the unidentified right fielder would have been Costello himself . While Joe DiMaggio was best known as a center fielder , when Abbott and Costello honed the sketch in 1936–37 , Joe DiMaggio had played a number of games at right field ( 20 in 1936 ) . ) Writing credit Writing credits for the sketch are unknown though , over the years , numerous people have claimed or been given credit for it . Such claims typically lack reasonable corroboration . For example , a 1993 obituary of comedy sketch writer Michael J . Musto states that , shortly after Abbott and Costello teamed up , they paid Musto $ 15 to write the script . Furthermore , several 1996 obituaries of songwriter Irving Gordon mention that he had written the sketch . Copyright infringement case In 2015 the heirs of Abbott and Costello filed a federal copyright infringement lawsuit in the Southern District of New York claiming unauthorized use of over a minute of the comedy routine in the play Hand to God . The lawsuit was filed against the playwright Robert Askins , the producers and the promoters . The defense claimed that the underlying \" Who \\'s On First ? \" routine was in the public domain because the original authors , Abbott and Costello , were not the ones who filed a copyright renewal , but the court did not see the need to make a final determination on that . The court ruled against the heirs , saying that the use by the play was transformative fair use . The heirs appealed , eventually to the US Supreme Court , which , in 2017 , declined to review the case . Derivatives and references in popular culture The sketch has been reprised , updated , alluded to , and parodied many times over the decades in all forms of media . Some examples include : The comedy troupe The Credibility Gap ( 1968–1979 ) did a rock group variation on this routine involving a promoter , played by Harry Shearer , and a newspaper advertising salesman , played by David L . Lander , confusing the night \\'s acts as proper nouns . The acts were The Who , The Guess Who and Yes . Eugene Levy and Tony Rosato performed a variation on this theme on the TV series SCTV ( 1976–1984 ) , with the rock groups The Band , The Who , and Yes . The final punchline changed to \" This is for the birds ( The Byrds ) ! \" \" Ah , they broke up long ago ! \" In 1977 , Frank and Daryl Kurtz , a local Dallas , Texas comedy duo , better known as The Good Time Gang ( 1977–78 , formerly known as the Playhouse Theatre which is also short-lived ) had once performed the routine on their Christian children \\'s television program by the same name off of Christian Broadcasting Network station KXTX . The skit would later release into their own vinyl shortly before the show \\'s cancellation in 1978 . The 1980 movie Airplane ! has a variation of this skit \\'s style with the aircraft crew including people named Victor Basta , Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock , easily mistaken for the radio terms \" vector \" , \" roger \" , \" clearance \" , and \" over \" . Poet Shel Silverstein cited Abbott and Costello ( presumably referring to \" Who \\'s On First \" ) as the inspiration for his poem \" The Meehoo With An Exactlywatt \" featured in his collection A Light in the Attic ( 1981 ) , which is stated in a short page of inspirations for select poems , located adjacent to the index . The biography of Lou Costello written by his daughter Chris is titled Lou \\'s on First ( 1982 ) . In the 1984 film Purple Rain , Morris Day and Jerome Benton copy the famous act only using \" what \" to start the routine to figure out an agreed-upon password to signal to each other when Apollonia Kotero arrives in the nightclub . In the mid-1980s , Johnny Carson \\'s spoof of then-president Ronald Reagan preparing for a press briefing included \" Hu is on the phone \" , a reference to fictional Chinese leader Chung Dong Hu . Reagan also misunderstands references to Secretary of the Interior James Watt ( misheard as \" what \" ) and PLO leader Yassir Arafat ( misheard as \" Yes sir \" ) . In the 1988 film Rain Man , the film \\'s titular character , played by Dustin Hoffman , stims by reciting the skit to himself whenever his brother Charlie , played by Tom Cruise , makes him anxious by meddling with his personal effects . In the Cheers 1989 episode , \" Do n\\'t Paint Your Chickens \" , a few of the characters start the routine after they start mixing up the names of Ingmar Bergman and Ingrid Bergman . In Donny Fort \\'s 1989 Christian comic book Forty Years , the routine is parodied when Moses attempts to introduce his brother Aaron to Hur , and misunderstandings arise because a woman is standing near Hur and the words \" Hur \" and \" her \" are similar . In the Animaniacs segment \" Woodstock Slappy \" ( 1994 ) , Slappy and Skippy Squirrel attend the 1969 Woodstock Festival , where they pay homage to the routine . Similar to the SCTV version , Slappy confuses The Who , The Band , and Yes for proper nouns . In 1996 , WWE changed the name of wrestler Jim Neidhart to \" Who \" thus allowing the announcers to perform the routine . In 1998 , French rapper Doc Gyneco used the routine for his Hexagonal song performed with Renaud . In the Invasion of the Neptune Men episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1998 , during one host segment , Mike and the \\'Bots put on a Who \\'s On First-themed skit concerning Japanese Noh Theater . Mad Magazine \\'s February 1999 issue featured an article ( written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Mort Drucker ) of Abbott and Costello trying to organize MTV \\'s music video library , with Costello getting confused by the names of songs such as Give Me One Reason , You Oughta Know , Ironic , What You Want , I Still Have n\\'t Found What I \\'m Looking For , Do n\\'t Speak , If It Makes You Happy , Stop , and Quit Playing Games . The names of bands U2 and No Doubt also cause confusion . In The Simpsons episode \" Marge Simpson in : \\'Screaming Yellow Honkers \\' , ( 1999 ) Superintendent Chalmers and Principal Skinner attempt to perform the routine , but Chalmers gives up after Skinner explains the joke with his first line : \" Not the pronoun , but rather a player with the unlikely name of \\'Who \\' is on first . \" The Terrance and Phillip : Behind the Blow episode of South Park ( 2001 ) showed that the duo made a routine called \\'Who farted ? \\' which bears similarities to \" Who \\'s On First \" . In 2002 , playwright Jim Sherman wrote a variation called \" Hu \\'s on First \" featuring George W . Bush being confused when Condoleezza Rice tells him that the new leader of China is named Hu , pronounced similarly to the word \" Who \" . Bush also misunderstands Rice \\'s references to Yassir Arafat ( \" yes , sir \" ) and Kofi Annan ( \" coffee \" ) . In the Get Fuzzy comic for September 12 , 2005 , an injured Rob asks Satchel to use speed dial to call \" Dr Watt \" , who is second on the speed dial list after Dr . Hu . Satchel gleefully replies \" Third Base ! \" , much to Rob \\'s annoyance . In the VeggieTales 2005 episode \" Duke and the Great Pie War \" , a contest demands that the characters name three members of the royal family : Sir Who , Prince What , and Lady I Do n\\'t Know . As an additional reference , the contest segment is hosted by a priest called \" the Abbot of Costello \" . A sketch from the episode \" Password : Swordfish \" ( 2006 ) in the second season of the stop-motion comedy series Robot Chicken pays tribute to this sketch , featuring the Fourth Doctor from the British sci-fi series Doctor Who standing on first base . Thus , [ Doctor ] Who is on first . In the 2007 film Rush Hour 3 , LAPD Detective James Carter ( Chris Tucker ) visits a Kung Fu studio where he meets Master Yu and an instructor named Mi . Carter , Yu and Mi engage in a comedic back and forth in which they confuse the names Yu and Mi with the words \" you \" and \" me . \" In the 2007 concert DVD An Awesome Christmas , acclaimed organists Dennis Awe and Paul Schaub perform a variation of the \" Who \\'s On First ? \" routine . In 2007 , Canadian Internet comedy group LoadingReadyRun released a parody called It \\'s Very Simple . Three episodes of Family Guy make reference to the routine – \" Extra Large Medium \" ( 2010 ) , \" You Ca n\\'t Do That on Television , Peter ( 2012 ) \" and \" Secondhand Spoke \" ( 2014 ) . In The Big Bang Theory season 4 , episode 10 \" The Alien Parasite Hypothesis \" ( 2010 ) , Sheldon and his girlfriend Amy do a take-off on the \" Who \\'s On First \" routine , when Amy uses the word \\'hoo \\' ( a noise she made when she got aroused ) and Sheldon mistakes it for \\'who \\' . Late Night with Jimmy Fallon , in December 2012 , featured a variation of the routine called \" Who \\'s on First ? : The Sequel \" . Depicted with vintage touches ( black and white images , retro costumes , etc . ) , the skit finds host Jimmy Fallon in the Bud Abbott role and announcer Steve Higgins as Lou Costello . The twist here is that \" Who \" , \" What \" , and \" I Do n\\'t Know \" actually join in on the quick repartee , with the players respectively played by Billy Crystal , Late Night head writer A . D . Miles , and Jerry Seinfeld . The October 19 , 2014 strip of the comic Pearls Before Swine sees Rat ask Goat , \" Whose drummer was Keith Moon ? \" Goat responds that he is correct , although Rat does not understand that Goat is telling him Moon was the drummer for The Who . It leads to a routine of more confusions , including Charlie Watts of The Rolling Stones , Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead , Steve Howe of Yes , and Pete Townshend – also of The Who . Thinking Goat is asking what band Townshend is the guitarist for , an exasperated Rat screams , \" I do n\\'t know ! \" Goat replies , \" Third base ! \" . The final panel sees the still-exasperated Rat threatening to hit the comic \\'s author Stephan Pastis with a baseball bat , asking \" When would you like this hit ? \" . Pastis responds , \" Winwood \\'s the guitarist for Traffic . \" In the video game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes ( 2015 ) , a puzzle called \" Who ’ s On First \" relates to the ambiguity of words such as \\'your\\'/\\'you \\'re , \\'their\\'/\\'there \\' , etc . In the My Little Pony : Friendship is Magic season 5 , episode 5 \" Tanks for the Memories \" ( 2015 ) , a group of Pegasi ponies are moving some clouds , three of whom are named Open Skies , Clear Skies , and Fluffy Clouds , much to another pony \\'s confusion . In 2017 , Studio C made a spin-off of this as a sketch in their seventh season , titled Detective Doctor , At Your Service , where several characters have names such as Detective Doctor , Doctor Hisbrother , and Officer Wounded , making the scene of an attempted murder much more confusing to deal with . In season 11 of All That ( 2019 ) , the \" Good Burger \" sketch used the routine , in which Kel Mitchell \\'s character Ed became confused when musical guest H.E.R . walked in to place an order after she told him who she was . In Jeff Dunham \\'s Completely Unrehearsed Last-Minute Pandemic Holiday Special from 2020 , Dunham and his puppet , Peanut , do a variation on the sketch involving Wi-Fi passwords . For example , the password for backstage is \" Icantellyou \" and the password for the tour bus is \" Idontremember \" . A variant of unknown origin , called \" Abbot and Costello do Hebrew \" , is popular in the Jewish American community . Its humor draws from the homophonic similarity of a number of words in English – hu , he , me , ma , and dag are homophones of the Hebrew words for he , she , who , what , and fish respectively . The skit is an easter egg on Google Assistant , Siri , Amazon Alexa , and Bixby . Asking Google Assistant \" OK Google , Who \\'s on first ? \" will lead to the response \" Yes , he is . \" or \" Exactly . \" Siri responds \" Correct . Who is on first . \" Alexa responds \" That \\'s what I keep telling you . Who \\'s on first , What \\'s on second . \" Bixby responds \" I think Who gets the ball and throws it to What . \" The Kids in the Hall featured Kevin McDonald and Dave Foley in a sketch as vaudevillians McGillicutty and Green , with Green being an incompetent straight man to McGillicutty \\'s comic . While performing \" Who \\'s on First ? \" , Green interrupts the routine to explain , \" You \\'re confused by their names because they all sound like questions , \" and explains that the first baseman is Samuel Hu , whose grandfather was Chinese , and the second baseman is Hector Watt , who shares his surname with James Watt , inventor of the steam engine . In Bojack Horseman Season 1 , Ep 11 ( Downer Ending ) , after reading the draft copy of his memoirs written by the ghost writer Diane ( and feeling insulted that the works casts him in a less than ideal light ) , Bojack attempts to write his own memoirs . Trying to concentrate he solicits the help of his former co-actress Sarah and her physician Dr . Allen Hu . Bojack initially mistakes the physicians name for \" Who \" , and in the digression with Sarah , Todd and Hu , everyone ends up confusing Dr . Who with Dr . Quinn and Doctor ( Allen ) Hu . There are several American restaurants named \" Who \\'s on First \" , located on 1st Street or 1st Avenue of their respective cities , including New York City , Waconia , MN , and Snohomish , WA Real-life parallels On October 3 , 1920 , Allie Watt played one game at second base for the Washington Senators so that , for a brief time , \" What \\'s on second \" . During a May 31 , 1966 game against the Minnesota Twins , Eddie Watt of the Baltimore Orioles led off the 5th inning with a double . In September 2007 , Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Chin-Lung Hu , a late-season callup from Albuquerque , got his first major league hit against the Arizona Diamondbacks , a single ; Dodgers announcer Vin Scully said , \" Shades of Abbott and Costello , I can finally say , \\'Hu is on first base .

The term stuttering is most commonly associated with involuntary sound repetition , but it also encompasses the abnormal hesitation or pausing before speech , referred to by people who stutter as blocks , and the prolongation of certain sounds , usually vowels or semivowels . According to Watkins et al. , stuttering is a disorder of \" selection , initiation , and execution of motor sequences necessary for fluent speech production \" . For many people who stutter , repetition is the main concern . The term \" stuttering \" covers a wide range of severity , from barely perceptible impediments that are largely cosmetic to severe symptoms that effectively prevent oral communication . Almost 70 million people worldwide stutter , about 1 % of the world \\'s population . The impact of stuttering on a person \\'s functioning and emotional state can be severe . This may include fears of having to enunciate specific vowels or consonants , fears of being caught stuttering in social situations , self-imposed isolation , anxiety , stress , shame , low self-esteem , being a possible target of bullying ( especially in children ) , having to use word substitution and rearrange words in a sentence to hide stuttering , or a feeling of \" loss of control \" during speech . Stuttering is sometimes popularly seen as a symptom of anxiety , but there is no direct correlation in that direction . Stuttering is generally not a problem with the physical production of speech sounds or putting thoughts into words . Acute nervousness and stress are not thought to cause stuttering , but they can trigger stuttering in people who have the speech disorder , and living with a stigmatized disability can result in anxiety and high allostatic stress load ( chronic nervousness and stress ) that reduce the amount of acute stress necessary to trigger stuttering in any given person who stutters , worsening the situation in the manner of a positive feedback system ; the name \\'stuttered speech syndrome \\' has been proposed for this condition . Neither acute nor chronic stress , however , itself creates any predisposition to stuttering . The disorder is also variable , which means that in certain situations , such as talking on the telephone or in a large group , the stuttering might be more severe or less , depending on whether or not the person who stutters is self-conscious about their stuttering . People who stutter often find that their stuttering fluctuates and that they have \" good \" days , \" bad \" days and \" stutter-free \" days . The times in which their stuttering fluctuates can be random . Although the exact etiology , or cause , of stuttering is unknown , both genetics and neurophysiology are thought to contribute . There are many treatments and speech therapy techniques available that may help decrease speech disfluency in some people who stutter to the point where an untrained ear can not identify a problem ; however , there is essentially no cure for the disorder at present . The severity of the person \\'s stuttering would correspond to the amount of speech therapy needed to decrease disfluency . For severe stuttering , long-term therapy and hard work is required to decrease disfluency . Characteristics Common behaviors Common stuttering behaviors are observable signs of speech disfluencies , for example : repeating sounds , syllables , words or phrases , silent blocks and prolongation of sounds . These differ from the normal disfluencies found in all speakers in that stuttering disfluencies may last longer , occur more frequently , and are produced with more effort and strain . Stuttering disfluencies also vary in quality : common disfluencies tend to be repeated movements , fixed postures , or superfluous behaviors . Each of these three categories is composed of subgroups of stutters and disfluencies . Repeated movements Syllable repetition—a single syllable word is repeated ( for example : on—on—on a chair ) or a part of a word which is still a full syllable such as \" un—un—under the ... \" and \" o—o—open \" . Incomplete syllable repetition—an incomplete syllable is repeated , such as a consonant without a vowel , for example , \" c—c—c—cold \" . Multi-syllable repetition—more than one syllable such as a whole word , or more than one word is repeated , such as \" I know—I know—I know a lot of information . \" . Fixed postures With audible airflow—prolongation of a sound occurs such as \" mmmmmmmmmom \" . Without audible airflow—such as a block of speech or a tense pause where nothing is said despite efforts . Superfluous behaviors Verbal—this includes an interjection such as an unnecessary uh or um as well as revisions , such as going back and correcting one \\'s initial statements such as \" I—My girlfriend ... \" , where the I has been corrected to the word my . Nonverbal—these are visible or audible speech behaviors , such as lip smacking , throat clearing , head thrusting , etc. , usually representing an effort to break through or circumvent a block or stuttering loop . Variability The severity of a stutter is often not constant even for people who severely stutter . Stutterers commonly report dramatically increased fluency when talking in unison with another speaker , copying another \\'s speech , whispering , singing , and acting or when talking to pets , young children , or themselves . Other situations , such as public speaking and speaking on the telephone , are often greatly feared , and increased stuttering is reported . Feelings and attitudes Stuttering could have a significant negative cognitive and affective impact on the person who stutters . It has been described in terms of the analogy to an iceberg , with the immediately visible and audible symptoms of stuttering above the waterline and a broader set of symptoms such as negative emotions hidden below the surface . Feelings of embarrassment , shame , frustration , fear , anger , and guilt are frequent in people who stutter , and may actually increase tension and effort , leading to increased stuttering . With time , continued exposure to difficult speaking experiences may crystallize into a negative self-concept and self-image . Many perceive stutterers as less intelligent due to their disfluency ; however , as a group , individuals who stutter tend to be of above average intelligence . People who stutter may project their attitudes onto others , believing that the others think them nervous or stupid . Such negative feelings and attitudes may need to be a major focus of a treatment program . Many people who stutter report a high emotional cost , including jobs or promotions not received , as well as relationships broken or not pursued . Fluency and disfluency Linguistic tasks can invoke speech disfluency . People who stutter may experience varying disfluency . Tasks that trigger disfluency usually require a controlled-language processing , which involves linguistic planning . In stuttering , it is seen that many individuals do not demonstrate disfluencies when it comes to tasks that allow for automatic processing without substantial planning . For example , singing \" Happy Birthday \" or other relatively common , repeated linguistic discourses , could be fluid in people who stutter . Tasks like this reduce semantic , syntactic , and prosodic planning , whereas spontaneous , \" controlled \" speech or reading aloud requires thoughts to transform into linguistic material and thereafter syntax and prosody . Some researchers hypothesize that controlled-language activated circuitry consistently does not function properly in people who stutter , whereas people who do not stutter only sometimes display disfluent speech and abnormal circuitry . Associated conditions Stuttering co-occurs with other learning disorders . These associated disabilities include : Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) : A disorder characterized by problems sustaining attention , hyperactivity , or acting impulsively . The prevalence of ADHD in school-aged children who stutter is around 4-50 % . Dyslexia : A disorder involving difficulties with reading and spelling . The prevalence rate of childhood stuttering in dyslexia is around 30-40 % , while in adults the prevalence of dyslexia in adults who stutter is around 30-50 % . Causes No single , exclusive cause of developmental stuttering is known . A variety of hypotheses and theories suggests multiple factors contributing to stuttering . Among these is the strong evidence that stuttering has a genetic basis . Children who have first-degree relatives who stutter are three times as likely to develop a stutter . However , twin and adoption studies suggest that genetic factors interact with environmental factors for stuttering to occur , and many stutterers have no family history of the disorder . There is evidence that stuttering is more common in children who also have concurrent speech , language , learning or motor difficulties . Robert West , a pioneer of genetic studies in stuttering , has suggested that the presence of stuttering is connected to the fact that articulated speech is the last major acquisition in human evolution . Another view is that a stutter or stammer is a complex tic . This view is held for the following reasons . It always arises from repetition of sounds or words . Young children like repetition and the more tense they are feeling , the more they like this outlet for their tension – an understandable and quite normal reaction . They are capable of repeating all types of behaviour . The more tension that is felt , the less one likes change . The more change , the greater can be the repetition . So , when a three-year-old finds he has a new baby brother or sister he may start repeating sounds . The repetitions can become conditioned and automatic and ensuing struggles against the repetitions result in prolongations and blocks in his speech . More boys stammer than girls , in the ratio of 3–4 boys : 1 girl . This is because the male hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis is more active . As males produce more cortisol than females under the same provocation , they can be tense or anxious and become repetitive . In a 2010 article , three genes were found by Dennis Drayna and team to correlate with stuttering : GNPTAB , GNPTG , and NAGPA . Researchers estimated that alterations in these three genes were present in 9 % of those who have a family history of stuttering . For some people who stutter , congenital factors may play a role . These may include physical trauma at or around birth , learning disabilities , as well as cerebral palsy . In others , there could be added impact due to stressful situations such as the birth of a sibling , moving , or a sudden growth in linguistic ability . There is clear empirical evidence for structural and functional differences in the brains of stutterers . Research is complicated somewhat by the possibility that such differences could be the consequences of stuttering rather than a cause , but recent research on older children confirms structural differences thereby giving strength to the argument that at least some of the differences are not a consequence of stuttering . Auditory processing deficits have also been proposed as a cause of stuttering . Stuttering is less prevalent in deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals , and stuttering may be reduced when auditory feedback is altered , such as by masking , delayed auditory feedback ( DAF ) , or frequency altered feedback . There is some evidence that the functional organization of the auditory cortex may be different in people who stutter . There is evidence of differences in linguistic processing between people who stutter and people who do not . Brain scans of adult stutterers have found greater activation of the right hemisphere , which is associated with emotions , than of the left hemisphere , which is associated with speech . In addition , reduced activation in the left auditory cortex has been observed . The capacities and demands model has been proposed to account for the heterogeneity of the disorder . In this approach , speech performance varies depending on the capacity that the individual has for producing fluent speech , and the demands placed upon the person by the speaking situation . Capacity for fluent speech may be affected by a predisposition to the disorder , auditory processing or motor speech deficits , and cognitive or affective issues . Demands may be increased by internal factors such as lack of confidence or self esteem or inadequate language skills or external factors such as peer pressure , time pressure , stressful speaking situations , insistence on perfect speech , and the like . In stuttering , the severity of the disorder is seen as likely to increase when demands placed on the person \\'s speech and language system exceed their capacity to deal with these pressures . However , the precise nature of the capacity or incapacity has not been delineated . Mechanism Physiology Though neuroimaging studies have not yet found specific neural correlates , there is much evidence that the brains of adults who stutter differ from the brains of adults who do not stutter . Several neuroimaging studies have emerged to identify areas associated with stuttering . In general , during stuttering , cerebral activities change dramatically in comparison to silent rest or fluent speech between people who stutter and people who do not . There is evidence that people who stutter activate motor programs before the articulatory or linguistic processing is initiated . Brain imaging studies have primarily been focused on adults . However , the neurological abnormalities found in adults does not determine whether childhood stuttering caused these abnormalities or whether the abnormalities cause stuttering . Studies utilizing positron emission tomography ( PET ) have found during tasks that invoke disfluent speech , people who stutter show hypoactivity in cortical areas associated with language processing , such as Broca \\'s area , but hyperactivity in areas associated with motor function . One such study that evaluated the stutter period found that there was overactivation in the cerebrum and cerebellum , and relative deactivation of the left hemisphere auditory areas and frontal temporal regions . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum ( RFO ) , which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks , occasionally incorporated in complex speech . Researchers have explored temporal cortical activations by utilizing magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) . In single-word-recognition tasks , people who did not stutter showed cortical activation first in occipital areas , then in left inferior-frontal regions such as Broca \\'s area , and finally , in motor and premotor cortices . The stutterers also first had cortical activation in the occipital areas but the left inferior-frontal regions were activated only after the motor and premotor cortices were activated . During speech production , people who stutter show overactivity in the anterior insula , cerebellum and bilateral midbrain . They show underactivity in the ventral premotor , Rolandic opercular and sensorimotor cortex bilaterally and Heschl \\'s gyrus in the left hemisphere . Additionally , speech production yields underactivity in cortical motor and premotor areas . Abnormal lateralization Much evidence from neuroimaging techniques has supported the theory that the right hemisphere of people who stutter interferes with left-hemisphere speech production . Adults who stutter have anatomical differences in gyri within the perisylvian frontotemporal areas . A large amount of white matter is found in the right hemisphere of the brain , including the region of the superior temporal gyrus . This was discovered using voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) . On the other hand , lesser amounts of white matter are found in the left inferior arcuate fasciculus connecting the temporal and frontal areas in stuttering adults . Results have shown that there is less coordination between the speech motor and planning regions in the brain \\'s left hemisphere of men and women who stutter , when compared to a non-stuttering control group . Anatomical connectivity of the speech motor and planning regions is less vigorous in adults who stutter , especially women . Men who stutter seem to have more right-sided motor connectivity . On the other hand , stuttering women have less connectivity with the right motor regions . In non-stuttering , normal speech , PET scans show that both hemispheres are active but that the left hemisphere may be more active . By contrast , people who stutter yield more activity on the right hemisphere , suggesting that it might be interfering with left-hemisphere speech production . Another comparison of scans anterior forebrain regions are disproportionately active in stuttering subjects , while post-rolandic regions are relatively inactive . Bilateral increases and unusual right-left asymmetry has been found in the planum temporale when comparing people who stutter and people who do not . These studies have also found that there are anatomical differences in the Rolandic operculum and arcuate fasciculus . Denis Drayna suggests that brain imaging studies of people who stutter do not tell if the differences in the brain anatomy caused stuttering or if they are the effect of stuttering ; In the mouse model for stuttering created by Drayna and team , they noticed significant similarities between the vocalizations in mice ( carrying GNPTAB mutation ) and human stuttering . Researchers investigated the brain tissue from the mice mutants and reported a significant decrease in the number and density of astrocytes in their corpus callosum . Astrocyte is a star-shaped cell in the brain that supports the nerve cells by supplying oxygen and nutrients , and taking away the waste . The corpus callosum enables the communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain . Follow-up experiments with the GNPTAB mutation introduced to brain cell types showed that the vocalization defects in mice were specific to the loss of astrocytes . Mice did not show stuttering-like vocalization defects when the mutation is engineered to other brain cell types . Other anatomical differences The corpus callosum transfers information between the left and right cerebral hemispheres . The corpus callosum , rostrum , and the anterior mid-body sections are larger in adults who stutter as compared to normally fluent adults . This difference may be due to unusual functions of brain organization in stuttering adults and may be a result of how the stuttering adults performed language-relevant tasks . Furthermore , previous research has found that adults who stutter show cerebral hemispheres that contain uncommon brain proportions and allocations of gray and white matter tissue . Dopamine Recent studies have found that adults who stutter have elevated levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine , and have thus found dopamine antagonists that reduce stuttering ( see anti-stuttering medication below ) . Overactivity of the midbrain has been found at the level of the substantia nigra extended to the red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus , which all contribute to the production of dopamine . However , increased dopamine does not imply increased excitatory function since dopamine \\'s effect can be both excitatory or inhibitory depending upon which dopamine receptors ( labelled D1 – D5 ) have been stimulated . Diagnosis Some characteristics of stuttered speech are not as easy for listeners to detect . As a result , diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech–language pathologist ( SLP ) . Diagnosis of stuttering employs information both from direct observation of the individual and information about the individual \\'s background , through a case history . Information from both sources should consider things such as age , the various times it has occurred , and other impediments . The SLP may collect a case history on the individual through a detailed interview or conversation with the parents ( if client is a child ) . They may also observe parent-child interactions and observe the speech patterns of the child \\'s parents . The overall goal of assessment for the SLP will be ( 1 ) to determine whether a speech disfluency exists , and ( 2 ) assess if its severity warrants concern for further treatment . During direct observation of the client , the SLP will observe various aspects of the individual \\'s speech behaviors . In particular , the therapist might test for factors including the types of disfluencies present ( using a test such as the Disfluency Type Index ( DTI ) ) , their frequency and duration ( number of iterations , percentage of syllables stuttered ( % SS ) ) , and speaking rate ( syllables per minute ( SPM ) , words per minute ( WPM ) ) . They may also test for naturalness and fluency in speaking ( naturalness rating scale ( NAT ) , test of childhood stuttering ( TOCS ) ) and physical concomitants during speech ( Riley ’ s Stuttering Severity Instrument Fourth Edition ( SSI-4 ) ) . They might also employ a test to evaluate the severity of the stuttering and predictions for its course . One such test includes the stuttering prediction instrument for young children ( SPI ) , which analyzes the child \\'s case history , part-word repetitions and prolongations , and stuttering frequency in order to determine the severity of the disfluency and its prognosis for chronicity for the future . Stuttering is a multifaceted , complex disorder that can impact an individual \\'s life in a variety of ways . Children and adults are monitored and evaluated for evidence of possible social , psychological or emotional signs of stress related to their disorder . Some common assessments of this type measure factors including : anxiety ( Endler multidimensional anxiety scales ( EMAS ) ) , attitudes ( personal report of communication apprehension ( PRCA ) ) , perceptions of self ( self-rating of reactions to speech situations ( SSRSS ) ) , quality of life ( overall assessment of the speaker \\'s experience of stuttering ( OASES ) ) , behaviors ( older adult self-report ( OASR ) ) , and mental health ( composite international diagnostic interview ( CIDI ) ) . The SLP will then attempt to combine the information garnered from the client \\'s case study along with the information acquired from the assessments in order to make a final decision regarding the existence of a fluency disorder and determine the best course of treatment for the client . Stuttering can also be diagnosed per the DSM-5 diagnostic codes by clinical psychologists with adequate expertise . The most recent version of the DSM-5 describes this speech disorder as \" Childhood-Onset Fluency Disorder ( Stuttering ) \" for developmental stuttering , and \" Adult-onset Fluency Disorder \" . However , the specific rationale for this change from the DSM-IV is ill-documented in the APA \\'s published literature , and is felt by some to promote confusion between the very different terms \" fluency \" and \" disfluency \" . Normal disfluency Preschool aged children often have difficulties with speech concerning motor planning and execution ; this often manifests as disfluencies related to speech development ( referred to as normal dysfluency or \" other disfluencies \" ) . This type of disfluency is a normal part of speech development and temporarily present in preschool aged children who are learning to speak . These normal disfluencies can present as interjections ( \" Um \" ) , multisyllabe repetitions ( \" I want I want to do that \" ) or revised/abandoned utterances ( \" I want/ hey what \\'s that ? \" ) . Normal disfluency should be ruled out before diagnosing stuttering . Classification Developmental stuttering ( also known as childhood onset fluency disorder ) is stuttering that originates when a child is learning to speak and may persist as the child matures into adulthood . Stuttering that persists after the age of seven is classified as persistent stuttering . Other much less common causes of stuttering include neurogenic stuttering ( stuttering that occurs secondary to brain damage , such as after a stroke ) and psychogenic stuttering ( stuttering related to a psychological condition ) . Other disorders with symptoms resembling stuttering include autism , cluttering , Parkinson \\'s disease , essential tremor , palilalia , spasmodic dysphonia , selective mutism , and social anxiety . Developmental Stuttering is typically a developmental disorder beginning in early childhood and continuing into adulthood in at least 20 % of affected children . The mean onset of stuttering is 30 months . Although there is variability , early stuttering behaviours usually consist of word or syllable repetitions , while secondary behaviours such as tension , avoidance or escape behaviours are absent . Most young children are unaware of the interruptions in their speech . With young stutterers , disfluency may be episodic , and periods of stuttering are followed by periods of relatively decreased disfluency . Though the rate of early recovery is very high , with time a young person who stutters may transition from easy , relaxed repetition to more tense and effortful stuttering , including blocks and prolongations . Some propose that parental reactions may affect the development of a chronic stutter . Recommendations to \" slow down \" , \" take a breath \" , \" say it again \" , etc. , may increase the child \\'s anxiety and fear , leading to more difficulties with speaking and , in the \" cycle of stuttering , \" to yet more fear , anxiety and expectation of stuttering . With time secondary stuttering , including escape behaviours such as eye blinking and lip movements , may be used , as well as fear and avoidance of sounds , words , people , or speaking situations . Eventually , many become fully aware of their disorder and begin to identify themselves as stutterers . With this may come deeper frustration , embarrassment and shame . Other , rarer patterns of stuttering development have been described , including sudden onset with the child being unable to speak , despite attempts to do so . The child usually is unable to utter the first sound of a sentence , and shows high levels of awareness and frustration . Another variety also begins suddenly with frequent word and phrase repetition , and does not include the development of secondary stuttering behaviours . Neurogenic stuttering Stuttering is also believed to be caused by neurophysiology . Neurogenic stuttering is a type of fluency disorder in which a person has difficulty in producing speech in a normal , smooth fashion . Individuals with fluency disorders may have speech that sounds fragmented or halting , with frequent interruptions and difficulty producing words without effort or struggle . Neurogenic stuttering typically appears following some sort of injury or disease to the central nervous system . Injuries to the brain and spinal cord , including cortex , subcortex , cerebellar , and even the neural pathway regions . Acquired stuttering In rare cases , stuttering may be acquired in adulthood as the result of a neurological event such as a head injury , tumour , stroke , or drug use . The stuttering has different characteristics from its developmental equivalent : it tends to be limited to part-word or sound repetitions , and is associated with a relative lack of anxiety and secondary stuttering behaviors . Techniques such as altered auditory feedback ( see below ) , which may promote decreasing disfluency in those with the developmental condition , are not effective with the acquired type . Psychogenic stuttering may also arise after a traumatic experience such as a grief , the breakup of a relationship or as the psychological reaction to physical trauma . Its symptoms tend to be homogeneous : the stuttering is of sudden onset and associated with a significant event , it is constant and uninfluenced by different speaking situations , and there is little awareness or concern shown by the speaker . Treatment Before beginning treatment , an assessment is needed , as diagnosing stuttering requires the skills of a certified speech–language pathologist ( SLP ) . While there is no complete cure for stuttering , several treatment options exist that help individuals to better control their speech . Many of the available treatments focus on learning strategies to minimize stuttering through speed reduction , breathing regulation , and gradual progression from single-syllable responses to longer words , and eventually more complex sentences . Furthermore , some stuttering therapies help to address the anxiety that is often caused by stuttering , and consequently worsens stuttering symptoms . This method of treatment is referred to as a comprehensive approach , in which the main emphasis of treatment is directed toward improving the speaker \\'s attitudes toward communication and minimizing the negative impact stuttering can have on the speaker \\'s life . Treatment from a qualified S-LP can benefit stutterers of any age . Speech language pathologists teach people who stutter to control and monitor the rate at which they speak . In addition , people may learn to start saying words in a slightly slower and less physically tense manner . They may also learn to control or monitor their breathing . When learning to control speech rate , people often begin by practising smooth , fluent speech at rates that are much slower than typical speech , using short phrases and sentences . Over time , people learn to produce smooth speech at faster rates , in longer sentences , and in more challenging situations until speech sounds both fluent and natural . When treating stuttering in children , some researchers recommend that an evaluation be conducted every three months in order to determine whether or not the selected treatment option is working effectively . \" Follow-up \" or \" maintenance \" sessions are often necessary after completion of formal intervention to prevent relapse . Fluency shaping therapy Fluency shaping therapy , also known as \" speak more fluently \" , \" prolonged speech \" , or \" connected speech \" , trains people who stutter to speak less disfluently by controlling their breathing , phonation , and articulation ( lips , jaw , and tongue ) . It is based on operant conditioning techniques . People who stutter are trained to reduce their speaking rate by stretching vowels and consonants , and using other disfluency-reducing techniques such as continuous airflow and soft speech contacts . The result is very slow , monotonic , but fluent speech , used only in the speech clinic . After the person who stutters masters these skills , the speaking rate and intonation are increased gradually . This more normal-sounding , fluent speech is then transferred to daily life outside the speech clinic , though lack of speech naturalness at the end of treatment remains a frequent criticism . Fluency shaping approaches are often taught in intensive group therapy programs , which may take two to three weeks to complete . Modification therapy The goal of stuttering modification therapy is not to eliminate stuttering but to modify it so that stuttering is easier and less effortful . The rationale is that since fear and anxiety causes increased stuttering , using easier stuttering and with less fear and avoidance , stuttering will decrease . The most widely known approach was published by Charles Van Riper in 1973 and is also known as block modification therapy . However , depending on the patient , speech therapy may be ineffective . Electronic fluency device Altered auditory feedback , so that people who stutter hear their voice differently , has been used for over 50 years in the treatment of stuttering . Altered auditory feedback effect can be produced by speaking in chorus with another person , by blocking out the person who stutters \\' voice while talking ( masking ) , by delaying slightly the voice of the person who stutters ( delayed auditory feedback ) or by altering the frequency of the feedback ( frequency altered feedback ) . Studies of these techniques have had mixed results , with some people who stutter showing substantial reductions in stuttering , while others improved only slightly or not at all . In a 2006 review of the efficacy of stuttering treatments , none of the studies on altered auditory feedback met the criteria for experimental quality , such as the presence of control groups . Mobile applications There are specialized mobile applications and PC programs for stutter treatment . The goal pursued by the applications of this kind is speech cycle restoration – I say – > I hear – > I build a phrase – > I say and so on , using various methods of stutter correction . The user interacts with the application through altered auditory feedback : they say something into the headset \\'s microphone and listen to their own voice in the headphones processed by a certain method . The following stutter correction methods are typically used in applications : MAF ( masking auditory feedback ) . It is basically masking by \" white noise \" or sinus noises of the user \\'s own speech . Scientists believe that people who stutter can speak more smoothly when they do not hear their own speech . This method is considered old-fashioned and ineffective . DAF ( delayed auditory feedback ) . This method involves sending the user \\'s voice from a microphone to headphones with a delay of fractions of a second . The goal of this method is to teach people who stutter to prolong vowels and reduce their speech rate . After speech correction with long delays , the application is adjusted at shorter delays which increase the speech rate until it becomes normal . FAF ( frequency-shifted auditory feedback ) . This method involves shifting the user \\'s voice tone frequency that they are listening to compared to their own voice . The shift range can be different : from several semitones to half an octave . Using metronomes and tempo correctors . Rhythmic metronome strikes are used in this method . The effectiveness of the method is related to the fact that rhythm has positive effect on someone who stutters , especially when pronouncing slowly . Using visual feedback . This method determines the user \\'s speech parameters ( for instance , speech tempo ) and their representation on screen as visual information . The principal goal of the method is allowing the user to effectively manage their voice through achieving the defined targeted parameters . It is supposed that the user sees visual representation of both current and targeted parameters ( such as speech tempo ) on the screen while pronouncing . Medications Although no medication is FDA approved for stuttering , several studies have shown certain medications to have beneficial effects on reducing the severity of stuttering symptoms . Although different classes of medications have been investigated , those with dopamine blocking activity have been shown in numerous trials to have positive effects on stuttering . These medications are FDA approved in the United States and hold similar approval in most countries for other conditions and their safety profiles are well established in these disorders . The best studied medication in stuttering is olanzapine whose effectiveness has been established in replicated trials . Olanzapine acts as a dopamine antagonist to D2 receptors in the mesolimbic pathway , and works similarly on serotonin 5HT2A receptors in the frontal cortex . At doses between 2.5–5 mg , olanzapine has been shown to be more effective than placebo at reducing stuttering symptoms , and may serve as a first-line pharmacological treatment for stuttering based on the preponderance of its efficacy data . However , other medications are generally better tolerated with less weight gain and less risk of metabolic effects than olanzapine . Risperidone and haloperidol have also shown effectiveness in the treatment of stuttering . However , haloperidol in particular often result in poor long-term compliance due to concerning side effects such as movement disorders and prolactin elevation , which can also occur with risperidone . Other dopamine active medications reported to positively treat stuttering include aripiprazole , asenapine , lurasidone , which tend to be better tolerated than olanzapine with less weight gain . All these medications as well as olanzapine can carry the potential risk of a long-term movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia . The investigational compound , ecopipam is unique from other dopamine antagonists in that it acts on D1 receptors instead of D2 , owing little , if any risk , of movement disorders . An open label study of ecopipam in adults demonstrated significantly improved stuttering symptoms with no reports of parkinsonian-like movement disorders or tardive dyskinesia which can be seen with D2 antagonists . In addition , ecopipam had no reported weight gain , but instead has been reported to lead to weight loss . In a preliminary study , it was well tolerated in subjects , effectively reduced stuttering severity , and was even associated in a short-term study with improved quality of life in persons who stutter . Further research is still warranted , but this novel mechanism is showing promise in the pharmacologic treatment of stuttering . One should always consult with a medical doctor before considering medication treatment of stuttering to review potential risks and benefits . Support With existing behavioral and prosthetic treatments providing limited relief and pharmacologic treatments in need of FDA approval for widespread use , support groups and the self-help movement continue to gain popularity and support from professionals and from people who stutter . Self-help groups provide people who stutter a shared forum within which they can access resources and support from others facing the same challenges of stuttering . One of the basic tenets behind the self-help movement is that since a cure does not exist , quality of life can be improved by not thinking about the stammer for prolonged periods . Psychoanalysis has claimed success in the treatment of stuttering . Hypnotherapy has also been explored as a management alternative . Support groups further focus on the fact that stuttering is not a physical impediment but a psychological one . Psychological approach Cognitive behavior therapy has been used to treat stuttering . Also sociological approaches has been explored regarding how social groups maintain stuttering through social norms . Diaphragmatic breathing Several treatment initiatives , for example the McGuire programme and the Starfish Project , advocate diaphragmatic breathing ( or costal breathing ) as a means by which stuttering can be controlled . Prognosis Among preschoolers with stuttering , the prognosis for recovery is good . Based on research , about 65 % to 87.5 % of preschoolers who stutter recover spontaneously by 7 years of age or within the first 2 years of stuttering , and about 74 % recover by their early teens . In particular , girls seem to recover well . For others , early intervention is effective in helping the child overcome disfluency . Once stuttering has become established , and the child has developed secondary behaviors , the prognosis is more guarded , and only 18 % of children who stutter after five years recover spontaneously . Stuttering that persists after the age of seven is classified as persistent stuttering , and is associated with a much lower chance of recovery . However , with treatment young children may be left with little evidence of stuttering . For adults who stutter , there is no known cure , though they may make partial recovery or even complete recovery with intervention . People who stutter often learn to stutter less severely , though others may make no progress with therapy . Emotional sequelae associated with stuttering primarily relates to state-dependent anxiety related to the speech disorder itself . However , this is typically isolated to social contexts that require speaking , is not a trait anxiety , and this anxiety does not persist if stuttering remits spontaneously . Research attempting to correlate stuttering with generalized or state anxiety , personality profiles , trauma history , or decreased IQ have failed to find adequate empirical support for any of these claims . Epidemiology The lifetime prevalence , or the proportion of individuals expected to stutter at one time in their lives , is about 5 % , and overall males are affected two to five times more often than females . However , there is not much information known about the underlying cause for such a skewed sex ratio . Most stuttering begins in early childhood , and studies suggest that 2.5 % of children under the age of 5 stutter . As seen in children who have just begun stuttering , there is an equivalent number of boys and girls who stutter . Still , the sex ratio appears to widen as children grow : among preschoolers , boys who stutter outnumber girls who stutter by about a two to one ratio , or less . This ratio widens to three to one during first grade , and five to one during fifth grade , as girls have higher recovery rates . Due to high ( approximately 65–75 % ) rates of early recovery , the overall prevalence of stuttering is generally considered to be approximately 1 % . Cross-cultural studies of stuttering prevalence were very active in early and mid-20th century , particularly under the influence of the works of Wendell Johnson , who claimed that the onset of stuttering was connected to the cultural expectations and the pressure put on young children by anxious parents . Johnson claimed there were cultures where stuttering , and even the word \" stutterer \" , were absent ( for example , among some tribes of American Indians ) . Later studies found that this claim was not supported by the facts , so the influence of cultural factors in stuttering research declined . It is generally accepted by contemporary scholars that stuttering is present in every culture and in every race , although the attitude towards the actual prevalence differs . Some believe stuttering occurs in all cultures and races at similar rates , about 1 % of general population ( and is about 5 % among young children ) all around the world . A US-based study indicated that there were no racial or ethnic differences in the incidence of stuttering in preschool children . At the same time , there are cross-cultural studies indicating that the difference between cultures may exist . For example , summarizing prevalence studies , E . Cooper and C . Cooper conclude : \" On the basis of the data currently available , it appears the prevalence of fluency disorders varies among the cultures of the world , with some indications that the prevalence of fluency disorders labeled as stuttering is higher among black populations than white or Asian populations \" ( Cooper & Cooper , 1993:197 ) . In his \" Stuttering and its Treatment : Eleven lectures \" Mark Onslow remarked that \" one recent study with many participants ( N=119,367 ) convincingly reported more stuttering among African Americans than other Americans . Why this could be the case is challenging to explain ... \" Different regions of the world are researched very unevenly . The largest number of studies has been conducted in European countries and in North America , where the experts agree on the mean estimate to be about 1 % of the general population ( Bloodtein , 1995 . A Handbook on Stuttering ) . African populations , particularly from West Africa , might have the highest stuttering prevalence in the world—reaching in some populations 5 % , 6 % and even over 9 % . Many regions of the world are not researched sufficiently , and for some major regions there are no prevalence studies at all ( for example , in China ) . Some claim the reason for this might be a lower incidence in the general population in China . History Because of the unusual-sounding speech that is produced and the behaviors and attitudes that accompany a stutter , it has long been a subject of scientific interest and speculation as well as discrimination and ridicule . People who stutter can be traced back centuries to the likes of Demosthenes , who tried to control his disfluency by speaking with pebbles in his mouth . The Talmud interprets Bible passages to indicate Moses was also a person who stuttered , and that placing a burning coal in his mouth had caused him to be \" slow and hesitant of speech \" ( Exodus 4 , v.10 ) . Galen \\'s humoral theories were influential in Europe in the Middle Ages for centuries afterward . In this theory , stuttering was attributed to imbalances of the four bodily humors—yellow bile , blood , black bile , and phlegm . Hieronymus Mercurialis , writing in the sixteenth century , proposed methods to redress the imbalance including changes in diet , reduced libido ( in men only ) , and purging . Believing that fear aggravated stuttering , he suggested techniques to overcome this . Humoral manipulation continued to be a dominant treatment for stuttering until the eighteenth century . Partly due to a perceived lack of intelligence because of his stutter , the man who became the Roman emperor Claudius was initially shunned from the public eye and excluded from public office . In and around eighteenth and nineteenth century Europe , surgical interventions for stuttering were recommended , including cutting the tongue with scissors , removing a triangular wedge from the posterior tongue , and cutting nerves , or neck and lip muscles . Others recommended shortening the uvula or removing the tonsils . All were abandoned due to the high danger of bleeding to death and their failure to stop stuttering . Less drastically , Jean Marc Gaspard Itard placed a small forked golden plate under the tongue in order to support \" weak \" muscles . Italian pathologist Giovanni Morgagni attributed stuttering to deviations in the hyoid bone , a conclusion he came to via autopsy . Blessed Notker of St . Gall ( c . 840–912 ) , called Balbulus ( \" The Stutterer \" ) and described by his biographer as being \" delicate of body but not of mind , stuttering of tongue but not of intellect , pushing boldly forward in things Divine , \" was invoked against stammering . A famous Briton who stammered was King George VI . George VI went through years of speech therapy , most successfully under Australian speech therapist Lionel Logue , for his stammer . This is dealt with in the Academy Award-winning film The King \\'s Speech ( 2010 ) in which Colin Firth plays George VI . The film is based on an original screenplay by David Seidler , who also stuttered until age 16 . Another notable case was that of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill . Churchill claimed , perhaps not directly discussing himself , that \" [ s ] ometimes a slight and not unpleasing stammer or impediment has been of some assistance in securing the attention of the audience ... \" However , those who knew Churchill and commented on his stutter believed that it was or had been a significant problem for him . His secretary Phyllis Moir commented that \" Winston Churchill was born and grew up with a stutter \" in her 1941 book I was Winston Churchill \\'s Private Secretary . She also noted about one incident , \" \\'It ’ s s-s-simply s-s-splendid , \\' he stuttered—as he always did when excited . \" Louis J . Alber , who helped to arrange a lecture tour of the United States , wrote in Volume 55 of The American Mercury ( 1942 ) that \" Churchill struggled to express his feelings but his stutter caught him in the throat and his face turned purple \" and that \" born with a stutter and a lisp , both caused in large measure by a defect in his palate , Churchill was at first seriously hampered in his public speaking . It is characteristic of the man ’ s perseverance that , despite his staggering handicap , he made himself one of the greatest orators of our time . \" For centuries \" cures \" such as consistently drinking water from a snail shell for the rest of one \\'s life , \" hitting a stutterer in the face when the weather is cloudy \" , strengthening the tongue as a muscle , and various herbal remedies were used . Similarly , in the past people have subscribed to theories about the causes of stuttering which today are considered odd . Proposed causes of stuttering have included tickling an infant too much , eating improperly during breastfeeding , allowing an infant to look in the mirror , cutting a child \\'s hair before the child spoke his or her first words , having too small a tongue , or the \" work of the devil \" . Some people who stutter , who are part of the disability rights movement , have begun to embrace their stuttering voices as an important part of their identity . In July 2015 the UK Ministry of Defence ( MOD ) announced the launch of the Defence Stammering Network to support and champion the interests of British military personnel and MOD civil servants who stammer and to raise awareness of the condition . Bilingual stuttering Identification Bilingualism is the ability to speak two languages . Many bilingual people have been exposed to more than one language since birth and throughout childhood . Since language and culture are relatively fluid factors in a person \\'s understanding and production of language , bilingualism may be a feature that impacts speech fluency . There are several ways during which stuttering may be noticed in bilingual children including the following . The child is mixing vocabulary ( code mixing ) from both languages in one sentence . This is a normal process that helps the child increase their skills in the weaker language , but may trigger a temporary increase in disfluency . The child is having difficulty finding the correct word to express ideas resulting in an increase in normal speech disfluency . The child is having difficulty using grammatically complex sentences in one or both languages as compared to other children of the same age . Also , the child may make grammatical mistakes . Developing proficiency in both languages may be gradual , so development may be uneven between the two languages . Adding a second or third language between the ages of three and five years of age may cause stuttering to increase ( become more severe ) . However , this may be the case only when : ( 1 ) the child \\'s first language is not strong or the child is experiencing difficulties in their first language , ( 2 ) One language is used more than the other or , ( 3 ) the child resists speaking the additional language . Stuttering may present differently depending on the languages the individual uses . For example , morphological and other linguistic differences between languages may make presentation of disfluency appear to be more or less of a problem depending on the individual case . Research Much research is being conducted to look at the prevalence of stuttering in bilingual populations and the differences between languages . For instance , one study concluded that bilingual children who spoke English and another language had an increased risk of stuttering and a lower chance of recovery from stuttering than monolingual speakers and speakers who spoke solely a language other than English . Another study , though methodologically weak , showed relatively indistinguishable percentages of monolingual and bilingual people who stutter . Due to so much conflicting data , the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has been called enigmatic , which can demonstrate the intricacies of the topic and encourages more research to be conducted in order to sway the belief of impact the relationship between bilingualism and stuttering has . In popular culture Jazz and Eurodance musician Scatman John wrote the song \" Scatman ( Ski Ba Bop Ba Dop Bop ) \" to help children who stutter overcome adversity . Born John Paul Larkin , Scatman spoke with a stutter himself and won the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association \\'s Annie Glenn Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community . Arkwright , the main protagonist in the BBC sitcom Open All Hours , had a severe stutter that was used for comic effect .

Lists of children \\'s television characters Non-American television series based on American television series', 'A posthumous name is an honorary name given to royalty , nobles , and sometimes others , in East Asia after the person \\'s death , and is used almost exclusively instead of one \\'s personal name or other official titles which had been used during the person \\'s life . The posthumous name is commonly used when naming royalty of China , Korea , Vietnam , Japan , and Thailand . Posthumous names in China and Vietnam were also given to honor the lifetime accomplishments of many people who did not have hereditary titles – for example , to courtiers and military generals . A posthumous name should not be confused with the era name ( 年號 ) , regnal name ( 尊號 ) and temple name ( 廟號 ) . Use The posthumous name consists of one or more adjectives inserted before the ruler \\'s current title . As rulers from different states might share the same posthumous name , but rulers within a state would usually not repeat an already used name , the name of the state or domain is usually also given to avoid ambiguity . In Chinese the whole construct is therefore \" [ state ] [ adjective ] [ title ] \" , which in English is typically translated as \" [ title ] [ adjective ] of [ state ] \" , such as King Wen of Zhou ( lit . \" Cultured King of Zhou \" ) , Duke Mu of Qin ( lit . \" Solemn Duke of Qin \" ) , and King Cheng of Chu ( lit . \" Accomplished King of Chu \" ) . The literal meaning of the adjective is normally not translated . While the names of living Chinese can be just about any combination of characters , the posthumous name was chosen from a rather small pool of stock characters ; the literal meaning of which eroded as a result . History Origins Early mythological rulers such as Emperor Yao are considered to have posthumous names . Archaeological discoveries have shown that early kings of the Zhou dynasty , such as King Wen and King Wu , used \" posthumous names \" during their lifetime , but later they became chosen by successors after the ruler \\'s death . As a result , final rulers of states and rulers seen as illegitimate ( such as usurpers ) often do not have posthumous names and are referred to by their personal names , e.g . Jian , King of Qi ; Min , Marquis of Jin ; and Chen Tuo . The use of posthumous names was stopped in the Qin Dynasty , because Qin Shi Huang proclaimed that it is disrespectful for the descendants , or \" later emperors \" to judge their elders , or the \" prior emperors \" ( 先帝 ) . The practice was revived in the Han Dynasty after the demise of Qin . Decline in use Posthumous names are the conventional way of referring to rulers from the Zhou dynasty to the Sui dynasty . In the Zhou dynasty the posthumous name was usually only one character , such as \" Wen \" ( cultured ) or \" Wu \" ( martial ) . However , as time went on rulers began to add more and more characters to the posthumous names of their ancestors . By the time of the first emperor of Tang the length had grown to 7 characters , which was taxing to pronounce or write . Therefore , emperors from Tang on are commonly referred to by either their temple name ( Tang through Yuan dynasties ) or era name ( Ming and Qing dynasties ) , both of which are always just two characters long and therefore easy to remember and use . Later developments Posthumous names commonly made tracing linear genealogies simpler and kept a bloodline apparent . The rule was also followed by non-Han Chinese rulers of Sixteen Kingdoms , Silla , Japan , Kingdom of Nanzhao , Liao dynasty , Vietnam , Western Xia , Jin dynasty , Yuan dynasty and Qing dynasty . King names of Hồng Bàng dynasty and Mahan also followed the rule but they are thought to be later work . Some rulers , such as Wu Zetian , or rebel leaders also had similar style regnal names when they were alive . Most monarchs inherited the throne and did not give bad posthumous names to the previous monarch . Some names were lengthened or changed by later monarchs . Emperor Aizong of Jin and Chongzhen Emperor had different names from different people . Qin Hui , of the Song dynasty , had a good name , was given a bad one , and had the good name later restored . After the Song dynasty few received bad names . Bad monarchs of the Joseon dynasty did not receive posthumous names . Emperors of China continued to receive posthumous names of increasing length as a matter of ritual long after the naming convention had been abandoned in casual speech and writing . The Guangxu Emperor , who died in 1908 and was the last emperor to receive a posthumous name , sports the impressive 21-character title of \" Emperor Tongtian Chongyun Dazhong Zhizheng Jingwen Weiwu Renxiao Ruizhi Duanjian Kuanqin Jing of Qing \" . Puyi , the last emperor of China , did not receive a posthumous name upon his death in 1967 since he died at the height of the Cultural Revolution , when such practices would have been thought feudal . Use of posthumous names ceased in China with the aforementioned Guangxu Emperor , in Vietnam with the Khải Định Emperor ( died 1925 ) and in Korea with the Yunghui Emperor ( died 1926 ) . However , in Korea unofficial posthumous names were given to Crown Prince Euimin and Gu , Prince Imperial Hoeun . Contemporary Japanese use Posthumous names are in use to this day in Japan . A deceased emperor is given a posthumous name , which beginning with Emperor Meiji ( d.1912 ) is identical to his era name and therefore always two characters long . The most recently conferred posthumous name is that of Emperor Shōwa ( d.1989 ) . A non-royal deceased person may be given a posthumous Buddhist name known as kaimyō , but is in practice still referred to by the living name . Guidelines Selection Posthumous names can be praises ( 褒字 ) or deprecations ( 貶字 ) . There are more praises than deprecations , so posthumous names are also commonly called respectful names ( 尊號 zūnhào ) in Chinese . Sima Qian \\'s Records of the Grand Historian outlines extensively the rules behind choosing the names . Some of those guidelines : Praises ( 上谥 ; shang shi ) Those having persistent and reasonable governance ( 剛強直理 ) are called \" Martial \" ( 武 wǔ ) .

However , most of these qualifications are subjective , repetitive , and highly stereotypical ; hence the names are chosen somewhat arbitrarily . Such names are usually given by court historians , according to their good deeds or the bad ones . When combining an emperor \\'s temple name and posthumous name , the temple name is placed first . For example , the Shunzhi Emperor whose full posthumous title would be \" Shizu , the Emperor Zhang \" ( 世祖章皇帝 ) , combining his temple name and the last 3 of his posthumous name , which is the form most commonly seen in traditional documents . A fuller description of this naming convention for royalty appears in the Chinese sovereign entry . The posthumous names of some monarchs and royal members were long , for example Hongwu Emperor , Nurhaci , Crown Prince Hyomyeong , Sunjo of Joseon and Empress Dowager Cixi . Some monarchs did not follow these guidelines . Some monarchs of Ju , Chu , and Qi used place names . Some monarchs of Yue ( state ) had Chinese transliterated posthumous names . Some monarchs of Goguryeo , Silla and Baekje had different style posthumous names . Some early Japanese monarchs also had Japanese-style posthumous names ( 和風諡号 ) . China Monarchs and consorts All Chinese posthumous names for rulers end in one or two of the characters for \" emperor \" , ( 皇帝 ) , which can be shortened to Dì ; except about a dozen or so less recognized ones who have had only Dì and no Huáng . Starting with Emperor Xiaowen of Han ( more commonly \" Emperor Wen \" ) , every single Han emperor , except the first one of the Eastern Han Dynasty , has the character of \" filial \" ( 孝 ) at the beginning of his posthumous names . \" Filial \" is also used in the full posthumous names of virtually all emperors and empresses of the Tang , Song , Ming and Qing Dynasties . For Qing emperors , the character is placed in various position in the string of characters . For those Qing empresses who were given posthumous names , is always initial . The number of characters in posthumous names increased . The emperors of the Tang Dynasty have names in between seven and eighteen characters . Most in the Qing Dynasty have over twenty characters . For instance , the Shunzhi Emperor ’ s name has 25 characters ( , [ ] : ) . The woman with the longest posthumous name ( also with 25 characters ) is Empress Dowager Cixi ( ) , or ( \" the Distinguished Empress who was Admirably Filial \" ) for short . Members of the ruling family According to the noble system since the Zhou Dynasty , the immediate family members of the Emperor were given the titles of Kings ( or Princes ) , Dukes , Earls , etc. , with or without actual control over a region of land . After their death , they would be referred to by the same title , with the posthumous name ( usually one character ) inserted in the middle . The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors , with the same denotations as described above . For example , Prince Gong of the Qing Dynasty was posthumously named Zhong ( 忠 ) , and thus is referred to as Prince Gongzhong ( 恭忠親王 Gongzhong qīnwáng ) ; Prince Chun was posthumous named Xian ( 賢 ) , hence is referred Prince Chunxian ( 醇賢親王 Chunxian qīnwáng ) . As for exception , the posthumous name could consist of more than one character . For example , Prince Shuncheng Lekdehun was posthumously honoured as \" Prince Shuncheng Gonghui \" ( 多罗顺承恭惠郡王 ) . Prince Yi of the First Rank Yinxiang was granted a posthumous name consisting of 9 characters \" Zhongjing chengzhi qinshen lianming xian \" ( 忠敬诚直勤慎廉明贤 ) . Officials It was also common for persons with no hereditary titles , especially accomplished scholar-officials or ministers , to be given posthumous names by the imperial court . The characters used are mostly the same ones used for emperors , with the same denotations as described above . The length , however , was restricted to one or two characters . The posthumous name is sometimes rendered canonization in English , for the scholar-official to Confucianism is analogous to the saint in the Catholic Church , though the process is not nearly as long . See List of Posthumous Names for some examples . Confucius has been given long posthumous names in almost every major dynasty . One of the most commonly used was Zhìshèngxiānshī ( 至聖先師 ) . Sometimes a person is given a posthumous name not by the court , but by his own family or disciples . Such names are private posthumous names ( Sīshì , 私諡 ) . For example , Tao Qian was given Sishi Jìngjié ( 靖節 ) . Korea In Korea , Goguryeo kings were mostly given posthumous names after their burial places , or in the case of Gwanggaeto , the name described his life . In Silla , every monarch was given the title of wang ( 왕 , 王 , \" king \" ) with two characters in posthumous names from Jijeung of Silla . On the other hand , all posthumous names for kings of Balhae were restricted to one character . Most of the kings of Goryeo and Joseon were more often given temple names than posthumous names , unlike in the dynasties of ancient Korea . All posthumous names for the rulers of Goryeo and Joseon end in two of the characters for Daewang ( 대왕 , 大王 , \" great king \" ) . This is a longer name , made up of adjectives characteristic of the king \\'s rule . For example , Gwangjong of Goryeo \\'s posthumous name was Hongdoseon Yeolpyeongse Sukheonui Hyoganghye Daeseong Daewang ( 홍도선열평세숙헌의효강혜대성대왕 , 弘道宣烈平世肅憲懿孝康惠大成大王 ) , while his temple name was Gwangjong . Details of the system of the posthumous names were made during the Joseon Dynasty . The deposed king \\'s names were made up of three parts : the temple name ( 묘호 ) , eulogistic names ( 존호 ) and posthumous names ( 시호 ) . During the Joseon Dynasty , officials discussed and decided the king \\'s posthumous name five days after the king \\'s funeral . The deceased king , who before his temple and posthumous names was decided , was called Daehaeng daewang ( 대행대왕 , 大行大王 ) . The Ministry of Culture and Education ( 예조 , 禮曹 ) was in charge of the naming . When officials of the ministry of culture and education selected three candidates and reported them to the next king , the next king chose one of those names that he liked best . Also , Shorn of his power , the deposed king has not been given any posthumous names with temple names unless reinstated . They were degraded to the rank of gun ( 군 , 君 , \" prince \" ) . Yeonsan-gun and Gwanghae-gun were are notable examples . And there are some men who did n\\'t ascend the throne in their lifetime but proclaimed as kings after they died by their descendants who became king . There are nine men who proclaimed as kings in the Joseon Dynasty . In Joseon , there are nine men who raised to the status of emeritus kings . Gojong of Joseon proclaimed Korea an empire in 1897 , receiving the title of emperor , thus the posthumous names of Gojong and Sunjong end in two of the characters for Hwangje ( 황제 , 皇帝 , \" emperor \" ) . For example , the full posthumous name of Emperor Gojong of Korea is Tongcheonyung-un Jogeukdonyun Jeongseonggwang-ui Myeonggongdaedeok Yojunsunhwi Umotanggyeong Eungmyeongripgi Jihwasinryeol Oehunhong-eop Gyegiseonryeok Geonhaenggonjeong Yeong-uihonghyu Sugangmunheon Mujanginik Jeonghyo Taehwangje ( 통천융운조극돈윤정성광의명공대덕요준순휘우모탕경응명립기지화신렬외훈홍업계기선력건행곤정영의홍휴수강문헌무장인익정효태황제 , 統天隆運 肇極敦倫 正聖光義 明功大德 堯峻舜徽 禹謨湯敬 應命立紀 至化神烈 巍勳洪業 啓基宣曆 乾行坤定 英毅弘休 壽康文憲 武章仁翼 貞孝太皇帝 ) , or Taehwangje for short . Crown Prince Hyomyeong has been given the longest posthumous name in Korea . He was posthumously elevated in status and given the title Emperor Munjo with 117 characters in posthumous names in 1899 . Japan In Japan , posthumous names are called shigō ( 諡号 ) , okuri-na ( 諡 ) , or tsuigo ( 追号 ) . Those of Japanese emperors are also sometimes called teigō ( 帝号 , \" emperor name [ s ] \" ) . There are two styles in emperors \\' posthumous names , namely Chinese style , and Japanese style . In addition to the appellation Tennō ( 天皇 , \" heavenly sovereign \" , usually translated as Emperor ) that is a part of all Japanese emperors \\' posthumous name , most of them consist of two kanji characters , although a few consist of three . Some names are given several generations later—this is the case for Emperor Jimmu and Emperor Antoku , for example . Others are given immediately after death , like that of Emperor Monmu . Many have Chinese-style names , for example : Emperor Jimmu ( 神武天皇 Jinmu Tennō , lit . Divine Might ) Emperor Nintoku ( 仁徳天皇 Nintoku Tennō , lit . Humane Virtue ) Emperor Ōjin ( 応神天皇 Ōjin Tennō , lit . Answering the Gods ) Some have Japanese-style names . For example : those who were named after the place where the emperor was born , lived or frequented : Emperor Saga ( 嵯峨天皇 Saga Tennō ) , named after a palace ( 院 in ) Emperor Ichijō ( 一条天皇 Ichijō Tennō ) , named after an official residence ( 邸 tei ) Emperor Kōmyō ( 光明天皇 Kōmyō Tennō ) , named after a temple Emperor Higashiyama ( 東山天皇 Higashiyama Tennō ) , named after a hill those who were named after an emperor whose admirable characteristics resemble those of an earlier one by adding Go ( 後 , lit . latter ) as a prefix to the earlier emperor \\'s name : Emperor Go-Ichijō ( 後一条天皇 Go-Ichijō Tennō ) Emperor Go-Daigo ( 後醍醐天皇 Go-Daigo Tennō ) Empress Go-Sakuramachi ( 後桜町天皇 Go-Sakuramachi Tennō ) those who were named by combining the characters from two previous emperors \\' names : Empress Genmei ( 元明天皇 Genmei Tennō ) + Empress Genshō ( 元正天皇 Genshō Tennō ) = Empress Meishō ( 明正天皇 Meishō Tennō ) Empress Shōtoku ( 称徳天皇 Shōtoku Tennō ) + Emperor Kōnin ( 光仁天皇 Kōnin Tennō ) = Emperor Shōkō ( 称光天皇 Shōkō Tennō ) Since the death of Emperor Meiji ( 明治天皇 Meiji Tennō ) in 1912 , the posthumous name of an emperor has always been the name of his era . For example , after his death , Hirohito ( by which he is usually called outside Japan ) was formally renamed Emperor Shōwa ( 昭和天皇 Shōwa Tennō ) after his era ; Japanese now refer to him by only that name . Hirohito was his given name ; most Japanese never refer to their emperors by their given names , as it is considered disrespectful . Thailand Since the death of king Chulalongkorn in 1910 , the reign name of a king has always been the name of his era , formally used in Gazette . Some also have petty change as posthumous name such as king Ananda \\'s add title Phra Athamaramathibodin as posthumous name . Only king Ananda and Bhumibol do n\\'t have specific reign name but another king such as Chulalongkorn which are personal name ; most of Thais never refer to their king by their personal name and colloquially Chula Chom Klao , as it is considered disrespectful , the personal name of the current King Vajiralongkorn will continue to be colloquially until his death and replaced as reign name Vajilaklao .

In LDS thought , this spirit world is divided into at least two conditions : Paradise and spirit prison : Paradise includes \" the spirits of the just , who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality . \" Spirit prison is the condition of the spirits of \" the wicked ... the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled themselves while in the flesh ... the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets \" . The latter will continue to receive gospel teaching and be given the opportunity to repent , though their disposition toward repentance will only change as they recognize and accept gospel truths and believe in Jesus Christ . Paradise The spirit world is believed to be a place of continued spiritual growth for all spirits who embrace the teachings of Christ . Christ organized this teaching process during the time between his death on the cross and his resurrection , among those who had been faithful to the gospel , so that they could teach those who had not yet heard its message . Brigham Young stated , Where is the spirit world ? It is right here ... Do [ spirits of the departed ] go beyond the boundaries of the organized earth ? No , they do not ... Can you see it with your natural eyes ? No . Can you see spirits in this room ? No . Suppose the Lord should touch your eyes that you might see , could you then see the spirits ? Yes , as plainly as you now see bodies . Joseph Smith taught : The spirits of the just ... are not far from us , and know and understand our thoughts , feelings , and emotions , and are often pained therewith . Spirit prison Spirit prison is believed by the Latter-day Saints to be both a place and the state of the soul between death and the resurrection , for people who have either not yet received knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ , or those who have been taught but have rejected it . It is a temporary state within the spirit world . Those who rejected the gospel after it was preached to them may suffer in a condition known as hell . The suffering associated with the spirit prison refers to anguish of the soul because of acute knowledge of one \\'s own sins and unclean state . Latter-day Saints believe that spirit prison ( a name based on the phrase \" the spirits in prison \" in the KJV translation of 1 Peter 3:19 ) is a place in the post-mortal spirit world for those who have \" died in their sins , without a knowledge of the truth , or in transgression , having rejected the prophets \" . This is a temporary state in which spirits will be taught the gospel and have the opportunity to repent and accept ordinances of salvation that are performed for them in temples . Those who accept the gospel may dwell in paradise until the resurrection . Those who choose not to repent but who are not sons of perdition will remain in spirit prison until the end of the Millennium , when they will be freed from hell and punishment and be resurrected to a telestial glory . Outer darkness In the teachings of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ( LDS Church ) , \" outer darkness \" has two separate meanings . Temporary abode of the wicked First , LDS Church scripture uses the term outer darkness to refer to a condition in the spirit world . The Book of Mormon teaches that after death , the spirits of those who \" chose evil works rather than good \" in mortality will be \" cast out into outer darkness \" . This is considered to be a condition of great torment , where there will be \" weeping , and wailing , and gnashing of teeth \" . In this sense , outer darkness and spirit paradise are the two possible destinations for individuals immediately after death . This place of torment in the spirit world is much more commonly referred to by modern Latter-day Saints as spirit prison . Popular use : permanent abode of sons of perdition Second , in modern Latter-day Saint vernacular , outer darkness usually refers to an eternal state of punishment . Mortals who during their lifetime become sons of perdition—those who commit the unpardonable sin—will be consigned to outer darkness . It is taught that the unpardonable sin is committed by those who \" den [ y ] the Son after the Father has revealed him \" . However , according to Mormon faith , since most humans lack such an extent of religious enlightment , they can not commit the Eternal sin , and the vast majority of residents of outer darkness will be the \" devil and his angels ... the third part of the hosts of heaven \" who in the pre-existence followed Lucifer and never received a mortal body . The residents of outer darkness who received a mortal body , while being resurrected like the rest of mankind , are the only children of God that will not receive one of three kingdoms of glory at the Last Judgment , remaining in that state of suffering for their own sins , for eternity . This state shares some similarities with certain Christian views of hell . On this subject , Joseph Smith taught that those who commit the unpardonable sin are \" doomed to Gnolaum—to dwell in hell , worlds without end . \" The word gnolaum is used elsewhere by Smith to mean \" eternal \" ( in the sense of \\'everlasting \\' or \\'forever \\' with perpetuity in time , and likely not \" eternal \" as \\'outside of time \\' or having no relationship with the temporality ) . It is believed by Latter-day Saints that \" few \" people who have lived on the earth will be consigned to this state , but Latter-day Saint scripture suggests that at least Cain will be present . Meaning It is unclear in the teachings of Mormonism whether both the temporary and permanent uses of outer darkness refer to physical places or if both are merely descriptions of personal states of suffering and torment . The uncanonized LDS Church Bible Dictionary suggests that biblical \" expressions about \\'hell-fire \\' are probably ... figurative of the torment of those who willfully disobey God . \" It is also unclear whether sons of perdition will ultimately be redeemed ; of outer darkness and the sons of perdition , Latter-day Saint scripture states that \" the end thereof , neither the place thereof , nor their torment , no man knows ; Neither was it revealed , neither is , neither will be revealed unto man , except to them who are made partakers thereof . \" See also Baptism for the dead Fate of the unlearned # Latter-day Saint tradition Intermediate state , a non-LDS term for the period between death and resurrection in Christian eschatology Paradise , for non-LDS usage of the term Spirit body Temple ( LDS Church ) Universalism and the Latter Day Saint movement Notes References Joseph Fielding Smith , The Way to Perfection , 1949 , Chapter 44 .

Some look-alikes have been notable individuals in their own right , such as Britain \\'s King George V and Russia \\'s Tsar Nicholas II , who bore a striking resemblance to each other ( they were first cousins ) . Other notable look-alikes have been notable solely for resembling well-known individuals , such as Clifton James , who acted as a double for British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery during World War II . Some look-alikes who have resembled celebrities have worked as entertainers , impersonating them on stage and screen , or at venues like parties and corporate functions .

The singular form is Tzadik Nistar ( ) . Origins The existence of 36 righteous people is first mentioned in the Talmud : There are no less than 36 righteous people in the world who greet the Shekhinah in each generation . Another Talmudic passage mentions the righteous people , most of them unknown , who sustain the world . However , it gives a number other than 36 : \" A homer of barley , and a half-homer of barley \" ( - [ this refers to ] 45 righteous who cause the world to be sustained ... 30 in the land of Israel and 15 here [ in Babylonia ] . Abaye said : And most of them can be found in the synagogue , under the upper room [ i.e . among the unhonored masses ] . These two sources were combined into the idea that the world is sustained by 36 righteous people . The combination may have derived from the fact that to \" greet the Shekhinah \" was originally associated with Temple service , and Temple service was considered to sustain the world ( Pirkei Avot 1:2 ) . The idea of 36 righteous became fully fleshed out in later generations : As a mystical concept , the number 36 is even more intriguing . It is said that at all times there are 36 special people in the world , and that were it not for them , all of them , if even one of them was missing , the world would come to an end . The two Hebrew letters for 36 are the lamed , which is 30 , and the vav , which is 6 . Therefore , these 36 are referred to as the Lamed-Vav Tzadikim . The idea is particularly prominent in Hasidic Judaism . Tzvi Elimelech Spira of Dinov , for example , wrote that \" in every generation , there are great righteous people who could perform wondrous acts , but the generation is not deserving of that , so the stature of the righteous people is hidden and they are not known to the public ; sometimes they are woodchoppers or water-drawers . \" Revealed and hidden righteous The Baal Shem Tov wrote that \" just as there are 36 hidden righteous , there are 36 revealed righteous . \" Their purpose Mystical Hasidic Judaism as well as other segments of Judaism believe that there exist thirty-six righteous people whose role in life is to justify the purpose of humanity in the eyes of God . Jewish tradition holds that their identities are unknown to each other and that , if one of them comes to a realization of their true purpose , they would never admit it : The Lamed-Vav Tzaddikim are also called the Nistarim ( \" concealed ones \" ) . In our folk tales , they emerge from their self-imposed concealment and , by the mystic powers , which they possess , they succeed in averting the threatened disasters of a people persecuted by the enemies that surround them . They return to their anonymity as soon as their task is accomplished , \\'concealing \\' themselves once again in a Jewish community wherein they are relatively unknown . The lamed-vavniks , scattered as they are throughout the Diaspora , have no acquaintance with one another . On very rare occasions , one of them is \\'discovered \\' by accident , in which case the secret of their identity must not be disclosed . The lamed-vavniks do not themselves know that they are one of the 36 . In fact , tradition has it that should a person claim to be one of the 36 , that is proof positive that they are certainly not one . Since the 36 are each exemplars of anavah , ( \" humility \" ) , having such a virtue would preclude against one ’ s self-proclamation of being among the special righteous . The 36 are simply too humble to believe that they are one of the 36 . Lamedvavniks Lamedvavnik ( ) , is the Yiddish term for one of the 36 humble righteous ones or Tzadikim mentioned in kabbalah or Jewish mysticism . According to this teaching , at any given time there are at least 36 holy persons in the world who are Tzadikim . These holy people are hidden ; i.e. , nobody knows who they are . According to some versions of the story , they themselves may not know who they are . For the sake of these 36 hidden saints , God preserves the world even if the rest of humanity has degenerated to the level of total barbarism . This is similar to the story of Sodom and Gomorrah in the Hebrew Bible , where God told Abraham that he would spare the city of Sodom if there was a quorum of at least 10 righteous men . Since nobody knows who the Lamedvavniks are , not even themselves , every Jew should act as if he or she might be one of them ; i.e. , lead a holy and humble life and pray for the sake of fellow human beings . It is also said that one of these 36 could potentially be the Jewish Messiah if the world is ready for them to reveal themselves . Otherwise , they live and die as an ordinary person . Whether the person knows they are the potential Messiah is debated . The term lamedvavnik is derived from the Hebrew letters Lamed ( L ) and Vav ( V ) , whose numerical value ( see Gematria ) adds up to 36 . The \" nik \" at the end is a Russian or Yiddish suffix indicating \" a person who ... \" ( As in \" Beatnik \" ; in English , this would be something like calling them \" The Thirty-Sixers \" . ) The number 36 is twice 18 . In gematria ( a form of Jewish numerology ) , the number 18 stands for \" life \" , because the Hebrew letters that spell chai , meaning \" living \" , add up to 18 . Because 36 = 2×18 , it represents \" two lives \" . In some Hasidic stories , disciples consider their Rebbes and other religious figures to be among the Lamedvavniks . It is also possible for a Lamedvavnik to reveal themselves as such , although that rarely happens—a Lamedvavnik \" \\'s status as an exemplar of humility would preclude it . More often , it is the disciples who speculate . These beliefs are articulated in the works of Max Brod , and some ( like Jorge Luis Borges ) believe the concept to have originated in the Book of Genesis 18:26 : In popular culture In the 1880 play The Two Kuni-Lemls by Avrom Goldfaden , Pinkhsel surmises that Kuni-Leml , the man betrothed to his daughter Carolina , is a \" lamed-vovnik \" because of the mysterious changes to his behavior and ability . In fact , it is Max , Carolina \\'s love interest , who keeps reentering the house disguised as Kuni-Leml . A play by Hans Rehfisch called Nickel and the 36 Righteous is a comedy in 3 acts ( 1925 ) .

Because of them the world continues to exist . They are the secret kings and queens of this world \" with the implication that he was one of the Tzadikim . In the 1998 book \" Stories of Deliverance \" , originally entitled \" Les Justes \" in French , translated by Michael Bernard from an original set of apparently true tales written by Marek Halter in the 1990s , relates the histories of 36 brave people who selflessly helped save victims and potential victims from World War II atrocities .

Jewish mysticism Jewish religious occupations Jewish theology es:36 justos', 'A telecommunications relay service , also known as TRS , relay service , or IP-relay , or Web-based relay service , is an operator service that allows people who are deaf , hard of hearing , deafblind , or have a speech disorder to place calls to standard telephone users via a keyboard or assistive device . Originally , relay services were designed to be connected through a TDD , teletypewriter ( TTY ) or other assistive telephone device . Services gradually have expanded to include almost any real-time text capable technology such as a personal computer , laptop , mobile phone , PDA , and many other devices . The first TTY was invented by deaf scientist Robert Weitbrecht in 1964 . The first relay service was established in 1974 by Converse Communications of Connecticut . Types of services available Depending on the technical and physical abilities and physical environments of users , different call types are possible via relay services . TTY to voice/voice to TTY Once the most common type of TRS call , TTY calls involve a call from a deaf or hard-of-hearing person who utilizes a TTY to a hearing person . In this type of call , typed messages are relayed as voice messages by a TRS operator , ( also known as Communication Assistant ( CA ) , Relay Operator ( RO ) , Relay Assistant ( RA ) , or relay agent ( agent ) ) , and vice versa . This allows callers who are unable to use a regular telephone to be able to place calls to people who use a regular telephone and vice versa . When the person who is hearing is ready for a response , it is customary to say \" go ahead \" or \" GA \" to indicate that it is the TTY ( teletypewriter ) user \\'s turn to talk and \" stop keying \" , \" SK \" , or \" ready to hang up \" when ending the call and vice versa . This mode of communication has largely been superseded by other modes of communications , including the utilization of IP relay , VPs , VRS , and VRI . Voice carry over A common type of call is voice carry over , VCO . This allows a person who is hard of hearing or deaf but can speak to use their voice while receiving responses from a person who is hearing via the operator \\'s typed text . There are many variations of VCO , including two-line VCO and VCO with privacy . VCO with privacy The operator will not hear the VCO user \\'s voiced messages and the VCO user does not need to voice GA . The operator will hear the person who is hearing , and the person who is hearing must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the VCO user \\'s turn . The VCO user does not need to voice GA , because the VCO user types it or presses the \" VCO GA \" button on the VCO phone when it \\'s the voice user \\'s turn to talk . Two-line VCO Two-line VCO allows a VCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator , who in turn calls the VCO user on a second telephone line , which serves as the voice line . The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person . This method is frequently used by people who are hard of hearing and like to use some of their residual hearing as well not having to say \" go ahead \" . With two-line VCO , the VCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other . VCO with Privacy can not be used with two-line VCO , because the operator , VCO user , and hearing person are on a three-way call . Hearing carry over A less common call type is hearing carry over ( HCO ) . HCO allows a person who is speech-disabled but can hear to use their hearing while sending responses to a person who is hearing via the HCO user \\'s typed text . The operator voices the HCO user \\'s typed messages , and then the HCO users picks up the handset and listens to the other voice user \\'s response . There are many variations of HCO , including two-line HCO and HCO with privacy . HCO with privacy The operator will not hear the voice user \\'s voiced messages and the voice user does not need to voice GA . The operator will voice for the person who is Speech-Disabled , and the person who is Speech–Disabled must give the GA each time to alert the operator it is the voice user \\'s turn . The voice user does not need to voice GA , because the HCO user can hear when the voice user finishes talking . 2-line HCO Similar to 2-line VCO , 2-line HCO allows an HCO user using a TTY or computer to call a TRS operator , who in turn calls the HCO user on a second telephone line , which serves as the voice line . The user puts the operator on a brief hold to initiate a three-way call with the hearing person . This method is frequently used by people who are Speech-Disabled and like to use some of their residual speech as well not having to type \" GA \" . With 2–Line HCO , the HCO user and the voice user can interrupt each other . HCO with Privacy can not be used with 2–Line HCO , because the operator , HCO user , and hearing person are on a three–way call . Speech to speech Speech to speech ( STS ) exists for people who have speech disabilities . A specially–trained STS TRS operator revoices what the person with a speech disability says . STS is often used in combination with VCO for people who are deaf and have somewhat understandable speech , as well as two–Line HCO users . STS enables people with speech disabilities to call others ( able-bodied speakers and other people with speech disabilities ) . It also enables people without speech disabilities to call people with speech disabilities . Anyone can call 711 in the U.S . and ask for Speech to Speech . STS is also available in Australia , New Zealand and Sweden . Many STS users have Parkinson \\'s disease , cerebral palsy , ALS , multiple sclerosis , muscular dystrophy or stroke . Other users stutter or have had a laryngectomy . STS also helps speech synthesizer users , users of Augmentative and Alternative Communication ( AAC . ) AAC users can set their device next to a speakerphone . They ask the STS CA set up the call , negotiate the menu , introduce the call explaining AAC and then go into the background . This enables AAC users to communicate independently once the other party is on the line . Deafblind variation Telebraille also exists for people who are deafblind with the use of a TTY with a braille or regular keyboard and a refreshable braille display or LVD ( Large Visual Display ) . A relay call of a user who is deafblind is directly related to a relay call of a TTY user , however , the text transmission speed is often reduced to increase the ability of the user who is deafblind to comprehend the moving braille on the braille TTY or large print on the LVD . Telebraille relay operators must be familiar with Braille contractions that users who are deafblind may use . Due to its implementation of a smaller keyboard , some TTY users with mobile disabilities may prefer to use a Telebraille , regardless of a sight disability or lack thereof . Captioned telephone Captioned telephone is a hybrid communication method that enables people who are hard of hearing , oral deaf or late–deafened to speak directly to another party on a telephone call . Typically , a telephone that displays real-time captions of what the hearing party speaks during a conversation . The captions are displayed on a screen embedded in the telephone base . A captioned telephone can also function exactly like a VCO when the user switches the device to VCO mode to do things like communicate with an HCO user directly , without relay . Captioned telephone services can be provided in traditional telephone environments as well as in VOIP environments . Captions are created by a communications assistant using a computer with voice recognition software . The communications assistant listens to and revoices the hearing party \\'s side of the conversation into the microphone of a headset . A voice recognition program creates the captions and they are sent out to the captioned telephone where they are read by the user . IP CTS Prior to 2005 , captioned telephone service was only available to people in states that had captioned telephone service as part of their state relay program . In 2005 , the FCC made IP CTS a part of the federally mandated services . IP CTS Requires an internet connection to deliver the captions to the user . Most also rely on their regular land-line telephone for the audio portion of the call , but some configurations of IP CTS allow the use of VOIP to carry the call audio . IP CTS has allowed captioned telephone service to be provided on smartphones and tablets . Two–line captioned telephone Captioned telephone can also be used with two lines . This is especially useful for users who prefer to give out their home phone number alone , instead of both the captioning service number and the toll-free captioning service number or for users who prefer to turn captions on and off anytime during the call . 2–Line captioned telephone can also be used with other relay services . For example , STS can be used with a 2–Line captioned telephone , for captioned telephone users with speech disabilities . 2–Line captioned telephone is only available to people in states that have 2–Line captioned telephone as part of their relay service or federal employees/contractors and American Indians . Web-based captioned telephone Web-based captioned telephone enables telephone calls to be placed with captions , by utilizing the World Wide Web browser window of a computer or smart phone . It is similar to a traditional captioned phone call except the user \\'s own telephone equipment is used , whilst the captions are viewed online instead of in the captioned telephone display screen . Other variations Many other call type variations are possible , including VCO to VCO , HCO to HCO , HCO to TTY , and VCO to TTY . Fundamentally , relay services have the ability to connect any two callers with different abilities over the telephone network . Voice callers in the United States can now access the service with a universal number : 711 . After the number is dialled , the caller will receive instructions to complete the call to reach deaf callers . IP/web-based relay services IP relay services , called Web-based text relay services in Europe , provide functionality similar to TDD/TTY relay services . Instead of using telephone lines and TDD/TTY devices , they use an Internet connection and software running on computers or smartphones . When using an IP relay service for an emergency call like 911 or 112 , the relay operator will ask for the street address , city , and state from which the call is originating . If this information is not provided , the relay operator will be unable to complete the emergency call . Most IP relay services support Web browsers , mobile phone apps , text messaging , WAP , instant messaging , and Text over IP ( ToIP ) . Support for these technologies has enabled many Internet-connected devices to be used with relay services , including desktop and laptop personal computers , mobile phones , and PDAs . Video relay service Video relay service ( VRS ) allows people who use sign language to place phone calls by signing instead of typing . The VI ( video interpreter ) uses a webcam or videophone to voice the deaf , hard-of-hearing or , speech-disabled person \\'s signs to a hearing person and sign the hearing person \\'s words to the deaf , hard-of-hearing or speech-impaired person . Video remote interpreting Video Remote Interpreting ( VRI ) allows deaf or hard-of-hearing people who use sign language to communicate with hearing people in the same room . VRI addresses one limitation to VRS , which is that VRS can not be used if the hearing person is in the same room with the deaf or hard-of-hearing person . VRI has proven to be useful for deaf or hard-of-hearing people in business meetings , doctor appointments , minor surgical procedures , and court proceedings . Accessibility In Canada and the United States , the telephone number 711 is used for the Telecommunications Relay Service . In the U.S. , every phone company is required to connect persons who dial 711 to a TRS call center from a working number . In July 2007 , the Federal Communications Commission ruled that the 711 requirement extended to VOIP telephony . Anyone can use 711 ; it is not limited to those who are deaf , hard of hearing , or speech impaired . As such , it has been used by those without hearing or speech disabilities to make long-distance calls free of charge with TRS providers who do not bill for them . Providers defend this as a necessary evil to maintain \" transparency \" , which is the belief that the operator and the mechanics of relay should generally go as unnoticed as possible in the call . This requires that TRS be as easy to use as normal telephones , which do not require their users to verify anything . Leaders in the deaf community defend this decision and generally retain strong support among service users with hearing and speech disabilities . Fraudulent uses in the United States The open structure of relay services has led to a number of complaints regarding its use as a vehicle for fraud . In 2004 , news outlets , such as MSNBC , and several newspapers , including the Baltimore City Paper , ran stories of reported abuse of the relay system , such as users from international locations calling businesses in the United States to fraudulently purchase goods . This has also generated numerous complaints , particularly by those who were employed as relay operators , that so-called \" prank calls , \" where neither user requires the service and the caller is just attempting to have fun with a novel mode of communication . In December 2006 , NBC ran another story where former operators alleged that \" 85 to 90 percent \" of calls were scams . Since it is illegal for relay service companies to keep records , fraudulent users can operate with impunity . Fraudulent calls of both types have been cited as reasons for further relay regulation , and as causes for long hold times that must be endured by many legitimate users . Most businesses legally can not have relay calls blocked due to the need for legitimate users to be accommodated , although businesses that are repeatedly victimized by pranks and/or scams often stop trusting relay calls or hang up on them because it is difficult to distinguish legitimate users from illegitimate ones ; this is another way that the abusers of the service ultimately victimize the legitimate users , in addition to tying up the service from them . In 2006 , the FCC launched a campaign to gather feedback from the various Internet Protocol relay-certified companies operating within the United States to fight the wave of relay scams and pranks being made over the service . As brought up in the FCC \\'s released document , users on the IP-based relay services can thus place their calls anonymously , which can not certify that the user in question really needs operator assistance or not . Furthermore , fraudulent calls of any nature cost millions to the American people yearly ( based on the $ 1.293 per minute fee that is being paid for completed IP-based relay ) to various relay providers for successfully completed calls . Starting in November 2009 , to help counter the problem of fraudulent use , the FCC began requiring all users of IP Relay to register their screen names with a default IP Relay provider . This , along with many IP Relay providers working to educate hearing users of the risks of fraudulent users ( making it less lucrative for fraudulent users who no longer have an uneducated population to target ) , and other efforts has greatly reduced the amount of fraudulent use of the IP Relay system . In March 2012 , the United States federal government announced a lawsuit against AT & T . The specific accusations state that AT & T \" violated the False Claims Act by facilitating and seeking federal payment for IP Relay calls by international callers who were ineligible for the service and sought to use it for fraudulent purposes . The complaint alleges that , out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline , AT & T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States . The complaint further contends that AT & T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers , which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT & T ’ s call volume . The government ’ s complaint alleges that AT & T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result . \" See also Relay ( disambiguation ) Telecommunications device for the deaf Text-to-9-1-1 References External links CapTel FCC Consumer Facts \" How to purchase a CapTel phone \" - February 9th , 2009 \" Hamilton WebCapTel \" - February 9th , 2009 \" Sprint WebCapTel \" - February 9th , 2009 Assistive technology Telephone services Deafness Telecommunication services', 'King Solomon \\'s Carpet ( 1991 ) is a novel by Barbara Vine , pseudonym of Ruth Rendell . It is about the London Underground and the people frequenting it . Vine \\'s novel is inhabited by ordinary passengers , tube aficionados , pickpockets , buskers , vigilantes , and children who go \" sledging \" on the roofs of cars as an initiation rite . The title of the book refers to the legend of King Solomon \\'s magic carpet of green silk which , as it could fly and brought everyone to their destination , is likened to the underground . King Solomon \\'s Carpet is one of the few novels set in London which should be read with the help of a tube map . It won the CWA Gold Dagger for best crime novel of the year in 1991 . Plot summary Jarvis Stringer is a student of the London Tube and its history and of underground trains worldwide . In order to finance his hobby and be able to travel to distant lands to inspect the underground systems in other parts of the world , he lets rooms in an old disused school building he has inherited which is close to the London Underground tracks in West Hampstead . There gather a group of misfits and weirdos , including a squatter , whose dreams of the good life have time and again been shattered as they are constantly victimized by society . There is 24-year-old Alice , an aspiring musician who leaves her husband and new-born baby only to end up busking in various stations in central London . There is Tom , who , after an accident , drops out of music school and is reduced to busking as well but who dreams of one day starting his own business . There is unemployed Tina , whose promiscuity landed her with two children whom she does not take care of in the way her mother thinks she ought to . There is Jed , who volunteers as a vigilante and who , disappointed by humans , lavishes all his love on the hawk he has acquired and which he keeps in the house . And there is Axel , an enigmatic man who regularly travels on the tube in the company of a man disguised as a bear and who is planning something illegal . Cecilia and Daphne , two old ladies living in the neighbourhood , serve as a foil to this ill-assorted group . It is Cecilia in particular who does not understand how young people such as her daughter Tina can be utterly devoid of morals . She is shocked to learn that her 10-year-old grandson enjoys riding on the roof of cars as they go through deep-level tunnels . While travelling on the tube herself , her handbag containing her credit cards is stolen , and she suffers a stroke in one of the packed cars . The novel is interspersed with extracts from Jarvis Stringer \\'s ( fictional ) book on the London Underground .

The original concept was made by Hitoshi Yasuda and Group SNE . The series is based on the Monster Collection trading card game . An anime television series adaptation animated by Studio Deen aired on TV Tokyo from January to December 2000 and consisted of 51 episodes and one film . The Saban-produced Mon Colle Knights aired on Fox Kids in North America from July 2001 to September 2002 , consisting of 45 episodes . In 2006 , it aired in reruns on Toon Disney \\'s Jetix on Sundays , as part of Jetix \\'s \" Anime Invasion Sundays \" block . The manga was published in English in Singapore by Chuang Yi . On June 9 , 2020 , the original Japanese version became available on Crunchyroll via Discotek Media . According to Justin Sevakis , the only reason why the anime is only available on Crunchyroll in Japanese is that the masters for the English dub could n\\'t be found . Discotek Media asked fans to help find the masters . They were still searching for it as of September 15 , 2020 . Discotek Media released the anime sub-only on Blu-ray on April 27 , 2021 . However , Discotek Media promised that they are still looking for the English dub . On December 13 , 2021 , it was announced Discotek had found the English dub masters and will be releasing the English dub on Blu-ray . Plot The series features Mondo Ooya and his classmate/girlfriend Rockna Hiiragi ( Rokuna in the Japanese version ) , whose scientist father Professor Ichiroubei Hiiragi invented a way to travel to Mon World ( Roku Mon Sekai : the Six Gate World ) , where all sorts of magical creatures live . Together , they try to find six monster items which , when combined , could connect the Six Gate World with planet Earth for the better of both worlds . Rokuna and Mondo form the Mon Colle Knights and find out that when chanting a phrase- ( \" With us , you can do it ! \" ) they can merge into monsters and control them into battle as well as aid with spells . Almost every episode , they battle Professor Hiiragi \\'s rival Prince Eccentro ( Count Collection in the Japanese version ) and his two girl underlings Gluko and Batch ( Goruko and Bachi in the Japanese version ) who are after the same thing as the Mon Colle Knights , except that they intend to use the items to dominate both worlds . Main characters Mon Colle Knights One of the main protagonists of the series and is an elementary school student at a local public school . Mondo is an adventurous young boy who seeks to gather the Mon items to bring together his world and Mon world for peace and friendship . Even though he has an outgoing and determined nature , Mondo has a little problem : he always flirts with pretty girls ( Beginner , Kahimi , and Lailai are the most notable ) . Note that the first Kanji in Mondo \\'s name ; \" , \" is the same that is used in the Mon Colle Knights title , . He has devices that he uses for his peace sign attack . / Rockna Hiiragi One of the main protagonists of the series . Rokuna is Mondo \\'s genius friend and classmate from school , whose intentions match Mondo \\'s . She has a special telepathic ability to communicate with monsters . Now her boyfriend Mondo likes drooling over her but she gets jealous if Mondo flirts with other girls causing Rokuna to attack him . The first Kanji in Rockna \\'s name ; \" , \" is the same that is used in the Mon Colle Knights title , . She has a baton like devices which she uses for her string or ribbon attack . Rokuna \\'s father and a rather eccentric sort of mad scientist . He discovered Mon World and wants the human world to know about it so he can win many awards . His laboratory is right across the street from Mondo and Rokuna \\'s school . / Lovestar Lovestar is a Zeechi that Rokuna adopted . A pale pink hamster-like monster with a red star marked on its back . In the Japanese version , their species is called \" Lovestar \" because the sounds the creatures make resemble the word \" love-love \" and the pattern on their backs make a star . Also in the Japanese version , Lovestar is called \" Jāne , \" because , when Rokuna was trying to say goodbye ( \" Jā ne \" ) to it , Lovestar thought she was calling it by name . A tiny monkey monster who punches . Cluckputer Professor Hiiragi \\'s chicken-based super computer . It usually serves as a computer for Professor Hiiragi and goes off by making chicken noises whenever a monster is nearby . Collection team / Prince Ludwig Von Monsterstein Eccentro One of the principal antagonists of the series . Prince Eccentro is a young effeminate aristocrat from Europe who wants to take over Mon World . He was born in 1974 and he was trained by Tanaka when his father wanted him to be a bad guy . He is not very threatening due to his eccentric behavior and hysterical persona at times . However , he is the inventor of the hypnotic Skeitso Beam ( whether on his Flying Lion aircraft or Teddyarenaut ) which he uses to bend monsters to his will . Because of that , he tends to have his evil moments , though he really is n\\'t as evil as he brags himself to be . Everytime Prince Eccentro fails , Tanaka would punish him with back-breaking exercises and/or harsh training that is related to the episode \\'s content . His dream is apparently to become a world famous belly dancer . Teddyarenaut A bear-like computer created by Eccentro . He serves as the counterpart to the Cluckputer and has a built-in Skeitso Beam . In one episode , he temporarily developed an A.I . because Savant Bear thought he was their king . / Batch Eccentro \\'s tomboyish lackey , with a brash , spunky , and often sarcastic personality . She tends to be much more committed to evil deeds than the foppish Eccentro or the air-headed Gluko . Batch unfortunately gets punished by Tanaka as well except in two episodes . Batch and Eccentro argue a lot , and sometimes Batch shows amusement at Eccentro \\'s mishaps . Ultimately they have a trusting and friendly relationship though , and Batch always follows the Count \\'s orders . She is shown to be a fitness enthusiast , as her bedroom is filled with exercise equipment . In the Japanese version , she speaks with a distinct Kansai dialect . / Gluko Eccentro \\'s big-breasted , yet air-headed and friendly underling . She is always spared by Tanaka when it is time for punishment and has an amount of luck . Goruko never seems to get hurt while the rest of her team and the Mon Colle Knights usually does . An English ongoing joke in the series is that during Eccentro \\'s launch sequence in each episode , she asks a very long and logic based question which ends with Eccentro and Batch becoming bored and saying \" Never mind , Goruko . \" In the Japanese version , Gluko speaks in a very polite and respectful dialect whether she \\'s talking to her teammates or her enemies . Goruko also carries around a book detailing about Mon World and his creatures . In a later episode , Gluko ends up adopting a Forest Imp named Impy . / Tanaka A midget old man who serves as Eccentro \\'s mentor under the orders of Eccentro \\'s father . He usually punishes Eccentro for his screw ups ( and/or lack of manly attitude ) with back-breaking exercises and/or harsh training related to the episode \\'s content . Tanaka tends to pop up anywhere . / Impy A cheerful young Forest Imp ( Leprechaun in the Japanese version ) who is Goruko \\'s pet . Goruko first found him in the forest near where Vipress was imprisoned . Impy does n\\'t talk very much -- he usually only utters short , inquisitive questions ( such as \" What this ? \" ) , or repeats cheerfully what Goruko says . He has psychic powers that allow him to telekinetically move things around , which comes in handy for some of Eccentro \\'s schemes . Impy also has a habit of fiddling with buttons on the Flying Lion aircraft and more often than not causing it to explode and send him and his allies blasting off . Despite his apparent carefree and dimwitted personality , Impy does care a lot for Goruko . A running gag sees him using his powers to switch Tanaka and Eccentro around in order for the latter to escape and make his attempt to conquer Mon World for the episode . Supporting cast / Naomi Loon Mondo and Rokuna \\'s teacher , a rather nice lady who has a short temper and terrible luck with love . For some reason , there is a monster card featuring her that is in Prince Eccentro \\'s possession . She is a skilled fighter as seen in some episodes . A cute but accident-prone girl with a large appetite who is learning to become a summoner . While powerful , her aim is terrible , so she tends to hurt her allies by accident . As a running gag , she has a habit of summoning a giant meteor that always ends destroying something . She is a friend of Mondo and Rokuna . Her grandfather , Expert , runs the summoning school she attends . In the Japanese version , Beginner refers to Mondo and Rokuna collectively as \" Roku-Mon-chan , \" much to their annoyance . A young girl which the Mon Colle Knights often encounter at random , while she travels the world carrying impossible amounts of little monsters in her coat . She gave Lovestar to Rokuna . / Kahimi An elf maiden with very long hair , whose beauty incites Rokuna \\'s jealousy whenever Mondo compliments Kahimi ( though Rokuna holds nothing against Kahimi herself ) . She becomes a good friend and ally of the Mon Colle Knights , especially with her ability to make plants grow and control over the winds of Mon World . A friend of Beginner \\'s who goes to the same summoning school as her . Luke has a poorly-disguised crush on Beginner and seems to like Rokuna . Luke is a summoning prodigy and considers Mondo his biggest rival as a monster summoner and for Beginner \\'s heart . Around Beginner , Luke becomes so nervous he can summon only purple sheep , not to be confused with his own sheep friend , Lambda . Beginner , for her part , is oblivious to Luke \\'s crush on her . Luke acts rather stingy and aloof towards strangers and he tends to be a bit of a crybaby when things do n\\'t go his way -- such as when someone , usually Mondo , interacts with Beginner or Lambda -- but he shows himself to quite brave in the face of danger , and his summoning abilities make him handy to have around . Prince Eccentro once lied to Luke telling him that Mondo is not a very good person causing Luke to summon Basilosaurus to attack Mondo with . Luke learned the truth when Prince Eccentro took over Basilosaurus . A purple sheep who is a friend of Luke \\'s . / Gabriolis A former Light Angel . During a great war between good and evil , he was wounded and left behind by his friend Lark . He felt betrayed and abandoned and embraced the darkness that Redda offered him transforming him into a Dark Angel . He plagued the Mon Colle Knights on different occasions involving attacking Doppelganger and casting a spell on 3 of Mondo \\'s cards ( consisting of Forester the Forest Giant , Flying Stego , and Scorch the Fire Monster ) until Spectra appeared and reversed the spell . When he was weakened by Vipress \\'s attack during his fight with Mondo and Water Dragon after Redda took control of the monsters , it was later revealed by Spectra and the Angel of all Oceans that Lark , in fact , took his place in battle and died ( in the English dub , he went to divert an approaching enemy flock and was n\\'t seen again ) after which Gabriolis realized his error and reverted to good , though maintaining his dark appearance . He also helped Mondo and Rockna defeat Dread Dragon and destroyed Redda in the final episode . Zaha \\'s name is derived from Zahariel , which means \" Brightness of God \" . Zahariel was the angel who would help people resist temptation . This is both ironic and fitting to his character , as he would first failed to resist temptation , then become someone who temps others , then turns into someone who helps others resist temptation , and finally become someone who is able to resist it himself too . The English dubbed name is derived from Gabriel , one of the archangels who typically serves as a messenger to humans from God . / Lucca He is a small demonic creature who is Gabriolis \\' friend and partner . On one occasion , he had possession of an item that had to be won over in a Mon World Baseball tournament . One of the principal antagonists of the series . Redda is a fallen angel like Gabriolis , who wants to use the six items to summon Oroboros . He is powerful , but not the strongest . Redda would prefer to avoid battle when not having a good advantage . In the dub , he wants to create a world of nothingness . In the original , he wants to create a formless world where all souls are the same and neither good nor evil will exist . Redda was the one who enabled Gabriolis to embrace the darkness after he was seemingly abandoned . In the final battle , he is killed by Gabriolis . N-Nouncer A man with a circle that has the letter N on it . He serves as the announcer of any tournaments in Mon World . / Spectra the Angel Lark \\'s sister and Zaha \\'s fiance in the Japanese version ( she is Gabriolis \\' sister in the English dub ) who sports a long gold dress and is always barefoot . Spectra is a Light Angel who comes to Gabriolis in his darkest hour to show him what really happened in the past so he may find redemption . She reappeared when Redda was chasing after her near the Fire Angel \\'s castle and was rescued by the Mon Colle Knights . Forest Angel / Earth Angel Mon World \\'s guardian angel of the Earth Realm who sports five pairs of wings . She first appeared to help the Mon Colle Knights put the Four-Armed Giant back to sleep by summoning the Emerald Dragon . It was the Forest Angel who told the Mon Colle Knights of the Guardian Angels \\' roles . Flame Angel / Fire Angel The guardian angel of the Fire Realm and the Guardian of the Solar Scepter ( one of the Mon items ) . Angel of all Oceans / Water Angel The guardian angel of the Water Realm and Guardian of the Arialla Pearl ( one of the Mon items ) who sports long purple hair , three wings , wears a strange dress , and is always barefoot . The Angel of all Oceans and Spectra revealed to Gabriolis what really happened the day when he was \" abandoned . \" Cloud Angel Mon World \\'s guardian angel of the Wind Realm who sports two pairs of wings . Monsters This is a list of all monsters featured in the anime Mon Colle Knights . Chimera - A three-headed monster that resemble a lion with dragon wings . It has a lion head , a maned lizard head , and a maned goat head where all three heads breathe fire . Prince Eccentro considers Chimera as one of his most powerful monsters .

In Homer \\'s Iliad he is portrayed as an energetic and powerful warrior , but in medieval literature he becomes a witty and licentious figure who facilitates the affair between Troilus and Cressida . In Shakespeare \\'s play Troilus and Cressida , he is portrayed as an aged degenerate and coward who ends the play by telling the audience he will bequeath them his \" diseases \" . Classical literature In Homer \\'s Iliad , Pandarus is a renowned archer and the son of Lycaon . Pandarus , who fought on the side of Troy in the Trojan War and led a contingent from Zeleia , first appeared in Book Two of the Iliad . In Book Four , he is tricked by Athena , who wishes for the destruction of Troy and assumes the form of Laodocus , son of Antenor , to shoot and wound Menelaus with an arrow , sabotaging a truce that could potentially have led to the peaceful return of Helen of Troy . He then attempts to kill Diomedes at close range , since Athena is protecting him from his deadly arrows , while Aeneas acts as his charioteer . Diomedes narrowly survives the attack , though , retaliating with a deadly blow that knocks Pandarus out of the chariot . Diomedes then pursues Aeneas , who is saved by his mother Aphrodite . Pandarus is also the name of a companion of Aeneas in Virgil \\'s Aeneid . His skull is cut in half vertically by Turnus \\' sword in Book IX of the Aeneid ; this ending his life and causing a panic among the other Trojans . Later literature Pandarus appears in Il Filostrato by Giovanni Boccaccio , in which he plays the role of a go-between in the relationship of his cousin Criseyde and the Trojan prince Troilus , the younger brother of Paris and Hector . Boccaccio himself derived the story from Le Roman De Troie , by 12th-century poet Benoît de Sainte-Maure . This story is not part of classical Greek mythology . Both Pandarus and other characters in the medieval narrative who carry names from the Iliad are quite different from Homer \\'s characters of the same name . In Geoffrey Chaucer ’ s poem Troilus and Criseyde ( 1370 ) , Pandarus plays the same role , though Chaucer \\'s Pandarus is Criseyde \\'s uncle , not her cousin . Chaucer \\'s Pandarus is of special interest because he is constructed as an expert rhetorician , who uses dozens of proverbs and proverbial sayings to bring the lovers Troilus and Criseyde together . When his linguistic fireworks fail at the end of the story , the proverb and human rhetoric in general are questioned as reliable means of communication . William Shakespeare used the medieval story again in his play Troilus and Cressida ( 1609 ) . Shakespeare \\'s Pandarus is more of a bawd than Chaucer \\'s , and he is a lecherous and degenerate individual . In The Duke \\'s Children by Anthony Trollope when the Duke of Omnium suspects Mrs Finn of encouraging his daughter \\'s romance he refers to her as a \\'she-Pandarus \\' . In \" The Sailor Who Fell From Grace With The Sea \" by Yukio Mishima , Pandarus is mentioned briefly during an internal contemplation by the character Ryuji Tsukazaki . Pandering The plot function of the aging lecher Pandarus in Chaucer \\'s and Shakespeare \\'s famous works has given rise to the English terms a pander ( in later usage a panderer ) , from Chaucer , meaning a person who furthers other people \\'s illicit sexual amours ; and to pander , from Shakespeare , as a verb denoting the same activity . A panderer is , specifically , a bawd — a male who arranges access to female sexual favors , the manager of prostitutes . Thus , in law , the charge of pandering is an accusation that an individual has sold the sexual services of another . The verb \" to pander \" is also used in a more general sense to suggest active or implicit encouragement of someone \\'s weaknesses . References Sources Trojans Male Shakespearean characters Middle English literature Prostitution Characters in the Aeneid Troilus and Cressida', 'Tathāgata ( ) is a Pali word ; Gautama Buddha uses it when referring to himself or other Buddhas in the Pāli Canon . The term is often thought to mean either \" one who has thus gone \" ( tathā-gata ) , \" one who has thus come \" ( tathā-āgata ) , or sometimes \" one who has thus not gone \" ( tathā-agata ) . This is interpreted as signifying that the Tathāgata is beyond all coming and going – beyond all transitory phenomena . There are , however , other interpretations and the precise original meaning of the word is not certain . The Buddha is quoted on numerous occasions in the Pali Canon as referring to himself as the Tathāgata instead of using the pronouns me , I or myself . This may be meant to emphasize by implication that the teaching is uttered by one who has transcended the human condition , one beyond the otherwise endless cycle of rebirth and death , i.e . beyond dukkha . Etymology and interpretation The word \\'s original significance is not known and there has been speculation about it since at least the time of Buddhaghosa , who gives eight interpretations of the word , each with different etymological support , in his commentary on the Digha Nikaya , the Sumangalavilasini : He who has arrived in such fashion , i.e . who has worked his way upwards to perfection for the world \\'s good in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas . He who walked in such fashion , i.e . ( a ) he who at birth took the seven equal steps in the same fashion as all previous Buddhas or ( b ) he who in the same way as all previous Buddhas went his way to Buddhahood through the four Jhanas and the Paths . He who by the path of knowledge has come at the real essentials of things . He who has won Truth . He who has discerned Truth . He who declares Truth . He whose words and deeds accord . The great physician whose medicine is all-potent . Modern scholarly opinion generally opines that Sanskrit grammar offers at least two possibilities for breaking up the compound word : either tathā and āgata ( via a sandhi rule ā + ā → ā ) , or tathā and gata . Tathā means \" thus \" in Sanskrit and Pali , and Buddhist thought takes this to refer to what is called \" reality as-it-is \" ( yathābhūta ) . This reality is also referred to as \" thusness \" or \" suchness \" ( tathatā ) , indicating simply that it ( reality ) is what it is . Tathāgata is defined as someone who \" knows and sees reality as-it-is \" ( yathā bhūta ñāna dassana ) . Gata \" gone \" is the past passive participle of the verbal root gam \" go , travel \" . Āgata \" come \" is the past passive participle of the verb meaning \" come , arrive \" . In this interpretation , Tathāgata means literally either “ the one who has gone to suchness ” or \" the one who has arrived at suchness \" . Another interpretation , proposed by the scholar Richard Gombrich , is based on the fact that , when used as a suffix in compounds , -gata will often lose its literal meaning and signifies instead \" being \" . Tathāgata would thus mean \" one like that \" , with no motion in either direction . According to Fyodor Shcherbatskoy , the term has a non-Buddhist origin , and is best understood when compared to its usage in non-Buddhist works such as the Mahabharata . Shcherbatskoy gives the following example from the Mahabharata ( Shantiparva , 181.22 ) : \" Just as the footprints of birds ( flying ) in the sky and fish ( swimming ) in water can not be seen , Thus ( tātha ) is going ( gati ) of those who have realized the Truth . \" The French author René Guénon , in an essay distinguishing between Pratyēka-Buddhas and Bodhisattvas , writes that the former appear outwardly superior to the latter , simply because they are allowed to remain impassible , whereas the latter must in some sense appear to rediscover “ a way ” or at least recapitulate it , so that others , too , may “ go that way , ” hence tathā-gata . The nature of a Tathāgata A number of passages affirm that a Tathāgata is \" immeasurable \" , \" inscrutable \" , \" hard to fathom \" , and \" not apprehended \" . A tathāgata has abandoned that clinging to the skandhas ( personality factors ) that render citta ( the mind ) a bounded , measurable entity , and is instead \" freed from being reckoned by \" all or any of them , even in life . The aggregates of form , feeling , perception , mental formations , and cognizance that compose personal identity have been seen to be dukkha ( a burden ) , and an enlightened individual is one with \" burden dropped \" .The Buddha explains \" that for which a monk has a latent tendency , by that is he reckoned , what he does not have a latent tendency for , by that is he not reckoned . These tendencies are ways in which the mind becomes involved in and clings to conditioned phenomena . Without them , an enlightened person can not be \" reckoned \" or \" named \" ; he or she is beyond the range of other beings , and can not be \" found \" by them , even by gods , or Mara . In one passage , Sariputta states that the mind of the Buddha can not be \" encompassed \" even by him . The Buddha and Sariputta , in similar passages , when confronted with speculation as to the status of an arahant after death , bring their interlocutors to admit that they can not even apprehend an arahant that is alive . As Sariputta puts it , his questioner Yamaka \" ca n\\'t pin down the Tathagata as a truth or reality even in the present life . \" These passages imply that condition of the arahant , both before and after parinirvana , lies beyond the domain where the descriptive powers of ordinary language are at home ; that is , the world of the skandhas and the greed , hatred , and delusion that are \" blown out \" with nirvana . In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta , an ascetic named Vaccha questions the Buddha on a variety of metaphysical issues . When Vaccha asks about the status of a tathagata after death , the Buddha asks him in which direction a fire goes when it has gone out . Vaccha replies that the question \" does not fit the case ... For the fire that depended on fuel ... when that fuel has all gone , and it can get no other , being thus without nutriment , it is said to be extinct . \" The Buddha then explains : \" In exactly the same way ... , all form by which one could predicate the existence of the saint , all that form has been abandoned , uprooted , pulled out of the ground like a palmyra-tree , and become non-existent and not liable to spring up again in the future . The saint ... who has been released from what is styled form is deep , immeasurable , unfathomable , like the mighty ocean . \" The same is then said of the other aggregates . A variety of similar passages make it clear that the metaphor \" gone out , he can not be defined \" ( atthangato so na pamanam eti ) refers equally to liberation in life . In the Aggi-Vacchagotta Sutta itself , it is clear that the Buddha is the subject of the metaphor , and the Buddha has already \" uprooted \" or \" annihilated \" the five aggregates . In Sn 1074 , it is stated that the sage can not be \" reckoned \" because he is freed from the category \" name \" or , more generally , concepts . The absence of this precludes the possibility of reckoning or articulating a state of affairs ; \" name \" here refers to the concepts or apperceptions that make propositions possible . Nagarjuna expressed this understanding in the nirvana chapter of his Mulamadhyamakakarika : \" It is not assumed that the Blessed One exists after death . Neither is it assumed that he does not exist , or both , or neither . It is not assumed that even a living Blessed One exists . Neither is it assumed that he does not exist , or both , or neither . \" Speaking within the context of Mahayana Buddhism ( specifically the Perfection of Wisdom sutras ) , Edward Conze writes that the term \\'tathagata \\' denotes inherent true selfhood within the human being : Five Tathāgatas In Vajrayana Buddhism , the Five Tathāgatas ( pañcatathāgata ) or Five Wisdom Tathāgatas ( Chinese : 五智如来 ; pinyin : Wǔzhì Rúlái ) , the Five Great Buddhas and the Five Jinas ( Sanskrit for \" conqueror \" or \" victor \" ) , are emanations and representations of the five qualities of the Adi-Buddha or \" first Buddha \" Vairocana or Vajradhara , which is associated with the Dharmakāya . The Five Wisdom Buddhas are a development of the Buddhist Tantras , and later became associated with the trikaya or \" three body \" theory of Buddhahood . While in the Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra there are only four Buddha families , the full Diamond Realm mandala with five Buddhas first appears in the Vajrasekhara Sutra . The Vajrasekhara also mentions a sixth Buddha , Vajradhara , \" a Buddha ( or principle ) seen as the source , in some sense , of the five Buddhas . \" The Five Buddhas are aspects of the dharmakaya \" dharma-body \" , which embodies the principle of enlightenment in Buddhism . When these Buddhas are represented in mandalas , they may not always have the same colour or be related to the same directions . In particular , Akshobhya and Vairocana may be switched . When represented in a Vairocana mandala , the Buddhas are arranged like this : The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity In the earliest strata of Pali Buddhist texts , especially in the first four Nikayas , only the following seven Buddhas , The Seven Buddhas of Antiquity ( Sattatathāgata , or \" The Seven Tathāgatas \" ) , are explicitly mentioned and named : . Of these , four are from the current kappa ( kalpa ) and three are from past ones . Vipassī ( lived ninety-one kappas ago ) Sikhī ( lived thirty-one kappas ago ) Vessabhū ( lived thirty-one kappas ago in the same kappa as Sikhī ) Kakusandha ( the first Buddha of the current bhaddakappa ) Koṇāgamana ( the second Buddha of the current bhaddakappa ) Kassapa ( the third Buddha of the current bhaddakappa ) Gotama ( the fourth and present Buddha of the current bhaddakappa One sutta called Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta from an early Buddhist text called the Dĩgha Nikãya also mentions that following the Seven Buddhas of Antiquity , a Buddha named Metteyya ( Maitreya ) is predicted to arise in the world . However , according to a text in the Theravada Buddhist tradition from a later strata ( between 1st and 2nd century BCE ) called the Buddhavaṃsa , twenty-one more Buddhas were added to the list of seven names in the early texts . Theravada tradition maintains that there can be up to five Buddhas in a kappa or world age and that the current kappa has had four Buddhas , with the current Buddha , Gotama , being the fourth and the future Buddha Metteyya being the fifth and final Buddha of the kappa . This would make the current aeon a bhaddakappa ( bhadrakalpa , fortunate aeon ) . In some Sanskrit and northern Buddhist traditions however , a bhadrakalpa has up to 1,000 Buddhas , with the Buddhas Gautama and Maitreya also being the fourth and fifth Buddhas of the kalpa respectively .

Vision of the Universe Abhirati and the Tathagata Aksobhya from Vimalakirti Nirdesa Sutra Epithets of Gautama Buddha Buddhist philosophical concepts Buddha-nature', 'A charlatan ( also called a swindler or mountebank ) is a person practicing quackery or a similar confidence trick in order to obtain money , fame , or other advantages through pretense or deception . Synonyms for charlatan include shyster , quack , or faker . Quack is a reference to quackery or the practice of dubious medicine , including the sale of snake oil , or a person who does not have medical training who purports to provide medical services . Etymology The word comes from French , a seller of medicines who might advertise his presence with music and an outdoor stage show . The best known of the Parisian charlatans was Tabarin whose skits and farces were influenced by commedia dell\\'arte inspired Molière . The word can also be traced to Spanish , an indiscreetly talkative person , a chatterbox . Ultimately , etymologists trace charlatan from either the Italian , to chatter or prattle ; or from Cerretano , a resident of Cerreto , a village in Umbria , known for its quacks . Usage A distinction is drawn between the charlatan and other kinds of confidence tricksters . The charlatan is usually a salesperson of a certain service or product , who has no personal relationship with his \" marks \" ( customers or clients ) , and avoids elaborate hoaxes or roleplaying con-games . Rather , the person called a charlatan is being accused of resorting to quackery , pseudoscience , or other knowingly employed bogus means of impressing people in order to swindle victims by selling them worthless nostrums and similar goods or services that will not deliver on the promises made for them . One example of a charlatan is a 19th-century medicine show operator , who has long since left town by the time the people who bought his \" snake oil \" or similarly named \" cure-all \" tonic realize that it was a scam . A misdirection by a charlatan is a confuddle , a dropper is a leader of a group of conmen , and hangmen are conmen that present false checks . A gaff means to trick or con and a mugu is a victim of a rigged game . In reported spiritual communications , a charlatan is a person who fakes evidence that a spirit is \" making contact \" with the medium and seekers . Notable people who have successfully debunked the claims of purported supernatural mediums include magician/scientific skeptic James Randi , Brazilian writer Monteiro Lobato and magician Harry Houdini . Infamous individuals Albert Abrams , the advocate of radionics and other similar electrical quackery who was active in the early twentieth century . John R . Brinkley , the \" goat-gland doctor \" who implanted goat glands as a means of curing male impotence , helped pioneer both American and Mexican radio broadcasting , and twice ran unsuccessfully for governor of Kansas . Alfredo Bowman , who claimed to cure all disease with herbs and a unique vegan , alkaline diet . Alessandro Cagliostro , ( real name Giuseppe Balsamo ) who claimed to be a count . Billie Sol Estes , a famous Texas conman . Gustavus Katterfelto , a Prussian conjurer who used a solar microscope which he claimed could detect disease . Ivar Kreuger , the Swedish \" Match King \" , who ran a worldwide Ponzi scheme in the 1920s . Bernard Madoff , an American stockbroker who ran the world \\'s largest Ponzi scheme , defrauding investors out of $ 18 billion . Elisha Perkins , the inventor of his own quack therapy that utilized \" tractors \" . John Henry Pinkard , Roanoke businessman and purveyor of quack medicines . Charles Ponzi , for whom the \" Ponzi scheme \" is named , a scam that relies on a \" pyramid \" of \" investors \" who contribute money to a fraudulent programme , typically where monies from later investors are used to pay unusually high returns to earlier investors , thus allowing and promoting the growth of the scheme . Grigori Rasputin , a self-proclaimed holy man and healer who gained considerable influence on the family of Tsar Nicholas II and was involved in the political turmoil on the brink of the Russian Revolution .

Medieval theologians of Western Europe described the underworld ( \" hell \" , \" hades \" , \" infernum \" ) as divided into four distinct parts : Hell of the Damned , Purgatory , Limbo of the Fathers or Patriarchs , and Limbo of the Infants . The Limbo of the Fathers is an official doctrine of the Catholic Church , but the Limbo of the Infants is not . Limbo of the Patriarchs The \" Limbo of the Patriarchs \" or \" Limbo of the Fathers \" ( Latin limbus patrum ) is seen as the temporary state of those who , despite the sins they may have committed , died in the friendship of God but could not enter Heaven until redemption by Jesus Christ made it possible . The term \" Limbo of the Fathers \" was a medieval name for the part of the underworld ( Hades ) where the patriarchs of the Old Testament were believed to be kept until Christ \\'s soul descended into it by his death through crucifixion and freed them ( see Harrowing of Hell ) . The Catechism of the Catholic Church describes Christ \\'s descent into Hell as meaning primarily that \" the crucified one sojourned in the realm of the dead prior to his resurrection . This was the first meaning given in the apostolic preaching to Christ \\'s descent into Hell : that Jesus , like all men , experienced death and in his soul joined the others in the realm of the dead . \" It adds : \" But he descended there as Saviour , proclaiming the Good News to the spirits imprisoned there . \" It does not use the word \" Limbo \" . This concept of Limbo affirms that admittance to Heaven is possible only through the intervention of Jesus Christ , but does not portray Moses , etc . as being punished eternally in Hell . The concept of Limbo of the Patriarchs is not spelled out in Scripture , but is seen by some as implicit in various references . Luke 16:22 speaks of the \" bosom of Abraham \" , which both the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church , following early Christian writers , understand as a temporary state of souls awaiting entrance into Heaven . The end of that state is set either at the Resurrection of the Dead , the most common interpretation in the East , or at the Harrowing of Hell , the most common interpretation in the West , but adopted also by some in the East . Jesus told the Good Thief that the two of them would be together \" this day \" in Paradise ( Luke 23:43 ; see also Matthew 27:38 ) ; but on the Sunday of his resurrection he said that he had \" not yet ascended to the Father \" ( John 20:17 ) . Some say that the descent of Jesus to the abode of the dead , his presence among them , turned it into a paradise . Others understand the text to mean not \" I say to you , This day you will be with me in paradise \" , but \" I say to you this day , You will be with me in paradise \" . Timothy Radcliffe explained the \" today \" as a reference to the \" Today of eternity \" . Jesus is also described as preaching to \" the spirits in prison \" ( 1 Peter 3:19 ) . Medieval drama sometimes portrayed Christ leading a dramatic assault – the Harrowing of Hell – during the three days between the Crucifixion and the resurrection . In this assault , Jesus freed the souls of the just and escorted them triumphantly into heaven . This imagery is still used in the Eastern Orthodox Church \\'s Holy Saturday liturgy ( between Good Friday and Pascha ) and in Eastern Orthodox icons of the Resurrection of Jesus . The doctrine expressed by the term \" Limbo of the Fathers \" was taught , for instance , by Clement of Alexandria ( c . 150 – c . 215 ) , who maintained : \" It is not right that these should be condemned without trial , and that those alone who lived after the coming [ of Christ ] should have the advantage of the divine righteousness . \" Limbo of Infants The Limbo of Infants ( Latin limbus infantium or limbus puerorum ) is the hypothetical permanent status of the unbaptised who die in infancy , too young to have committed actual sins , but not having been freed from original sin . Recent Catholic theological speculation tends to stress the hope , although not the certainty , that these infants may attain heaven instead of the state of Limbo . Most Roman Catholic priests and hierarchy will now say that no child could ever be condemned for the sins committed by our ancestors and that they no longer believe that limbo for children exists . While the Catholic Church has a defined doctrine on original sin , it has none on the eternal fate of unbaptised infants , leaving theologians free to propose different theories , which magisterium is free to accept or reject . Limbo is one such theory , although the word \" limbo \" itself is never mentioned in the Catechism of the Catholic Church . Latin Fathers In countering Pelagius , who denied original sin , Saint Augustine of Hippo was led to state that because of original sin , \" such infants as quit the body without being baptized will be involved in the mildest condemnation of all . That person , therefore , greatly deceives both himself and others , who teaches that they will not be involved in condemnation ; whereas the apostle says : \\'Judgment from one offence to condemnation \\' ( Romans 5:16 ) , and again a little after : \\'By the offence of one upon all persons to condemnation\\'. , \" The Council of Carthage ( 418 ) , a council of North African bishops which included Augustine of Hippo , did not explicitly endorse all aspects of Augustine \\'s stern view about the destiny of infants who die without baptism , but said , among other things , \" that there is no intermediate or other happy dwelling place for children who have left this life without Baptism , without which they can not enter the kingdom of heaven , that is , eternal life \" . So great was Augustine \\'s influence in the West , however , that the Latin Fathers of the 5th and 6th centuries ( e.g. , Jerome , Avitus of Vienne , and Gregory the Great ) did adopt his position . Medieval theologians In the later medieval period , some theologians continued to hold Augustine \\'s view . In the 12th century , Peter Abelard ( 1079–1142 ) said that these infants suffered no material torment or positive punishment , just the pain of loss at being denied the beatific vision . Others held that unbaptised infants suffered no pain at all : unaware of being deprived of the beatific vision , they enjoyed a state of natural , not supernatural happiness . This theory was associated with but independent of the term \" Limbo of Infants \" , which was coined about the year 1300 . If Heaven is a state of supernatural happiness and union with God , and Hell is understood as a state of torture and separation from God then , in this view , the Limbo of Infants , although technically part of hell ( the outermost part , \" limbo \" meaning \" outer edge \" or \" hem \" ) is seen as a sort of intermediate state . The question of Limbo is not treated in the parts of the Summa Theologica written by Saint Thomas Aquinas himself , but is dealt with in an appendix to the supplement added after his death by Fra Rainaldo da Piperino . The Limbo of Infants is there described as an eternal state of natural joy , untempered by any sense of loss at how much greater their joy might have been had they been baptised : Every man who has the use of free-will is adapted to obtain eternal life , because he can prepare himself for grace whereby to merit eternal life ; so that if he fails in this , his grief will be very great , since he has lost what he was able to possess . But children were never adapted to possess eternal life , since neither was this due to them by virtue of their natural principles , for it surpasses the entire faculty of nature , nor could they perform acts of their own whereby to obtain so great a good . Hence , they will nowise grieve for being deprived of the divine vision ; nay , rather will they rejoice for that they will have a large share of God \\'s goodness and their own natural perfections . Nor can it be said that they were adapted to obtain eternal life , not indeed by their own action , but by the actions of others around them , since they could be baptised by others , like other children of the same condition who have been baptised and obtained eternal life : for this is of superabundant grace that one should be rewarded without any act of one \\'s own . Wherefore the lack of such a grace will not cause sorrow in children who die without Baptism , any more than the lack of many graces accorded to others of the same condition makes a wise man to grieve . The natural happiness possessed in this place would consist in the perception of God mediated through creatures . As stated in the International Theological Commission \\'s document on the question : Modern era The Ecumenical Council of Florence ( 1442 ) spoke of baptism as necessary even for children and required that they be baptised soon after birth . This had earlier been affirmed at the local Council of Carthage ( 417 ) . The Council of Florence also stated that those who die in original sin alone go to hell , but with pains unequal to those suffered by those who had committed actual mortal sins . John Wycliffe \\'s attack on the necessity of infant baptism was condemned by another general council , the Council of Constance . The Council of Trent in 1547 explicitly stated that baptism ( or desire for baptism ) was the means by which one is transferred \" from that state wherein man is born a child of the first Adam , to the state of grace , and of the adoption of the sons of God , through the second Adam , Jesus Christ , our Saviour . Pope Pius X taught of limbo \\'s existence in his Catechism . However , through the 18th and 19th centuries , individual theologians ( Bianchi in 1768 , H . Klee in 1835 , Caron in 1855 , H . Schell in 1893 ) continued to formulate theories of how children who died unbaptised might still be saved . By 1952 a theologian such as Ludwig Ott could , in a widely used and well-regarded manual , openly teach the possibility that children who die unbaptised might be saved for heaven . He also told about Thomas Cajetan , a major 16th-century theologian , that suggested infants dying in the womb before birth , and so before ordinary sacramental baptism could be administered , might be saved through their mother \\'s wish for their baptism . In its 1980 instruction on children \\'s baptism the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith stated that \" with regard to children who die without having received baptism , the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God , as indeed she does in the funeral rite established for them \" , leaving all theories as to their fate , including Limbo , as viable possibilities . And in 1984 , when Joseph Ratzinger , then Cardinal Prefect of that Congregation , stated that he rejected the claim that children who die unbaptised can not attain salvation , he was speaking for many academic theologians of his training and background . The Church \\'s teaching expressed in the 1992 Catechism of the Catholic Church is that \" Baptism is necessary for salvation for those to whom the Gospel has been proclaimed and who have had the possibility of asking for this sacrament . \" It adds that \" God has bound salvation to the sacrament of Baptism , but he himself is not bound by his sacraments \" . It recalls that , apart from the sacrament , \" baptism of blood \" ( as in the case of the martyrs ) and in the case of catechumens who die before receiving the sacrament , explicit desire for baptism , together with repentance for their sins , and charity , ensures salvation . It states that , since Christ died for all and all are called to the same divine destiny , \" every man who is ignorant of the Gospel of Christ and of his Church , but seeks the truth and does the will of God in accordance with his understanding of it , can be saved \" , seeing that , if they had known of the necessity of baptism , they would have desired it explicitly . It then states : As regards children who have died without Baptism , the Church can only entrust them to the mercy of God , as she does in her funeral rites for them . Indeed , the great mercy of God who desires that all men should be saved , and Jesus \\' tenderness toward children which caused him to say : \" Let the children come to me , do not hinder them \" , allow us to hope that there is a way of salvation for children who have died without Baptism . All the more urgent is the Church \\'s call not to prevent little children coming to Christ through the gift of holy Baptism . Merely stating that one can \" hope \" in a way of salvation other than baptism , the Church thus urgently reiterates its appeal to baptize infants , the only certain means to \" not prevent \" their \" coming to Christ \" for salvation . On 20 April 2007 , the advisory body known as the International Theological Commission released a document , originally commissioned by Pope John Paul II , entitled \" The Hope of Salvation for Infants Who Die without Being Baptized . \" After tracing the history of the various opinions that have been and are held on the eternal fate of unbaptized infants , including that connected with the theory of the Limbo of Infants , and after examining the theological arguments , the document stated its conclusion as follows : Pope Benedict XVI authorized publication of this document , indicating that he considers it consistent with the Church \\'s teaching , though it is not an official expression of that teaching . Media reports that by the document \" the Pope closed Limbo \" are thus without foundation . In fact , the document explicitly states that \" the theory of limbo , understood as a state which includes the souls of infants who die subject to original sin and without baptism , and who , therefore , neither merit the beatific vision , nor yet are subjected to any punishment , because they are not guilty of any personal sin . This theory , elaborated by theologians beginning in the Middle Ages , never entered into the dogmatic definitions of the Magisterium . Still , that same Magisterium did at times mention the theory in its ordinary teaching up until the Second Vatican Council . It remains therefore a possible theological hypothesis \" ( second preliminary paragraph ) ; and in paragraph 41 it repeats that the theory of Limbo \" remains a possible theological opinion \" . The document thus allows the hypothesis of a limbo of infants to be held as one of the existing theories about the fate of children who die without being baptised , a question on which there is \" no explicit answer \" from Scripture or tradition . The traditional theological alternative to Limbo was not Heaven , but rather some degree of suffering in Hell . At any rate , these theories are not the official teaching of the Catholic Church , but are only opinions that the Church does not condemn , permitting them to be held by its members , just as is the theory of possible salvation for infants dying without baptism . In other denominations and religions Neither the Eastern Orthodox Church nor Protestantism accepts the concept of a limbo of infants ; but , while not using the expression \" Limbo of the Patriarchs \" , the Eastern Orthodox Church lays much stress on the resurrected Christ \\'s action of liberating Adam and Eve and other righteous figures of the Old Testament , such as Abraham and David , from Hades ( see Harrowing of Hell ) . Some Protestants have a similar understanding of those who died as believers prior to the crucifixion of Jesus residing in a place that is not Heaven , but not Hell . The doctrine holds that Hades has two \" compartments \" , one an unnamed place of torment , the other named Abraham \\'s Bosom . Luke 16:19–16:26 speaks of a chasm fixed between the two which can not be crossed . Those in the unnamed \" compartment \" have no hope , and will ultimately be consigned to hell . Those in Abraham \\'s bosom are those of whom it is written of Jesus , \" When He ascended on high , He led captive a host of captives ... \" ( Ephesians 4:8 ) , quoting Psalm 68:18 ) . These individuals , the captives , now reside with God in Heaven . Both \" Compartments \" still exist , but Abraham \\'s Bosom is now empty , while the other chamber is not , according to this doctrine . Latter-day Saints teach , \" there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body ... a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time ... that the dead shall come forth , and be reunited , both soul and body , and be brought to stand before God , and be judged according to their works . \" . It is also taught that \" all who have died without a knowledge of [ the ] gospel , who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry , shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God . \" . Jehovah \\'s Witnesses , Christadelphians , and others have taught that the dead are unconscious ( or even nonexistent ) , awaiting their destiny on Judgment Day . The Zoroastrian concept of hamistagan is similar to limbo . Hamistagan is a neutral state in which a soul that was neither good nor evil awaits Judgment Day . In Islam , which denies the existence of original sin in totality , the concept of Limbo exists as Barzakh , the state that exists after death , prior to the day of resurrection . During this period , sinners are punished and the adequately purified rest in comfort . Children however are exempt from this stage , as they are regarded as innocent and are automatically classed as Muslims ( despite religious upbringing ) . After death , they go directly to Heaven , where they are cared for by Abraham . According to Christian Louis Lange , Islam also possesses a al-aʿrāf ( cf . Q.7:46 ) \" a residual place or limbo \" situated between heaven and hell where there is \" neither punishment nor reward \" . In Classical Greek mythology , the section of Hades known as the Fields of Asphodel were a realm much resembling Limbo , to which the vast majority of people who were held to have deserved neither the Elysian Fields ( Heaven ) nor Tartarus ( Hell ) were consigned for eternity . In Buddhism , Bardo ( Sanskrit : antarabhāva ) is sometimes described as similar to limbo . It is an intermediate state in which the recently deceased experiences various phenomena before being reborn in another state , including heaven or hell . According to Mahāyāna Buddhism , the arhat must ultimately embrace the path of the bodhisattva , despite having reached enlightenment . The Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra states that an arhat obtains a \" samādhikāya ( rapture-body ) \" and is reborn in a lotus in a transitory state of existence , unable to awaken for a whole eon . This is likened to a person intoxicated who must spend a certain period of time before becoming sober . Cultural references In the Divine Comedy poem Inferno , Dante depicts Limbo as the first circle of Hell . The virtuous pagans of classical history and mythology inhabit a brightly lit and beautiful – but somber – castle , which is seemingly a medieval version of Elysium . They include Hector , Julius Caesar , Virgil , Electra , and Orpheus . Virtuous non-Christians , such as the Muslims Saladin and Averroes , were also described as among its residents . In his novel In the First Circle , Russian writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn used Dante \\'s first circle , or limbo for allusion . One of Nobel Prize-winning poet Seamus Heaney \\'s best known works is titled Limbo . In the Artemis Fowl series , \" Limbo \" is the timeless plane of existence where the demon fairies are trapped until The Lost Colony . In the film Inception , Limbo is a deep subconscious level , far beyond false awakening , and a state in which the characters may be trapped indefinitely . In the 1973 adult film The Devil in Miss Jones , The main character Justine Jones who just killed herself by slitting her wrists somehow finds herself in Limbo . In The Monster Squad , a 1987 comedy/horror film written by Shane Black and Fred Dekker , the way to defeat the monsters is to open a hole in the universe and cast them into Limbo . In The Matrix Revolutions , third and last installment of The Matrix series , Neo gets trapped in a train station named Mobil Ave . He learns that the station ( located \" nowhere \" ) is a sort of borderworld , a passage between the \" Matrix \" and the \" Machine \" ( the place where the Machines reside in the real ) world . Mobil is an anagram of Limbo . In the final episode of the BBC time travel/cop show Ashes to Ashes ( Series 3 , Episode 8 ) , it is revealed that the world that Alex Drake awoke to after being shot , which Sam Tyler described and that other major characters inhabit , is a kind of Limbo , one seemingly specifically for members of the police force , who had died in violent or sudden ways . In the indie game Limbo , a boy walks through a black and white world searching for his sister . In DmC : Devil May Cry , Limbo is a parallel dimension in which the main setting of Limbo City becomes a demonically influenced version of its real world counterpart . The demons that rule Limbo City can drag their victims into Limbo and manipulate the landscape to create twists and turns to entrap the protagonist , Dante . In Marvel Comics , Limbo is the name of 2 dimensions : one is a section outside of time ruled over by a future version of Kang the Conqueror called Immortus , the other is a dimension of demons commonly under the rule of Belasco . In DC Comics , Limbo is a dimension inhabited by old characters who have been removed from continuity or seemingly abandoned or forgotten . \" In Limbo \" is the 11th track on Genesis \\' debut album \" From Genesis to Revelation \" . \" In Limbo \" is the 7th track on Radiohead \\'s 2000 album \" Kid A \" . In the BBC CW TV series The Vampire Diaries , a form of limbo called \" The Other Side \" is created by a powerful witch named Qetsiyah , creating it as a Purgatory for all supernatural ( vampires , witches , werewolves , doppelgängers , hybrids , etc . ) beings go in death , it prevents any supernatural being from reaching a form of Heaven called \" Peace \" . In Warframe , one of the many playable Warframes is named Limbo , who has the ability to travel through a second dimension called the Rift Plane , by tapping into the Void to his advantage against his enemies and in some support to his allies . Sitting in Limbo is a song by Jamaican singer/writer/composer/actor Jimmy Cliff , he recorded it at Muscle Shoals Sound Studio in Alabama , USA in 1971 , for his album Another Cycle . The song can be heard in the 1972 Perry Henzell \\'s film The Harder They Come as a prophetic musical prelude to Ivan \\'s death , the character played by Cliff himself : Sitting here in limbo / Waiting for the tide to flow / Sitting here in limbo / Knowing that I have to go ... In the anime/manga Naruto , Limbo is described as an \" in-between dimension \" which is connected to the real world but can not be seen by people without the special viewing ability \" Rinnegan \" . In the anime/manga Inuyasha , Limbo was called the \" Border of the Afterlife \" which is the demon graveyard uses the Black Pearl , Tekki , the blood that connects to the underworld , and the gateway to the border from the Realm of Fire in Feudal Japan . In Inuyasha the Movie : Swords of an Honorable Ruler , Toga \\'s third sword So\\'unga can transport to the border . In Yashahime : Princess Half-Demon , Moroha will use the Black Pearl to enter the Border of the Afterlife to reunite with her parents .

It won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 1974 . Plot summary The story takes place in a dystopian future where the world is controlled by a capitalist regime . Despite advertising being illegal ( \" ad \" is , in fact , a dirty word ) , corporations are still able to persuade and control consumers by the celebrities they create for product placement . The protagonist , seventeen-year-old Philadelphia Burke , or P . Burke , is enlisted to become one of these celebrities after a suicide attempt fueled by society ostracizing her due to her Pituitary Dystrophy , better known as Cushing \\'s Disease . While recovering in the hospital , she is chosen by a scout to become a \" Remote Operator \" for the beautiful corporate creation , known as Delphi , who was grown without a functioning brain from a modified embryo in an artificial womb . Though Delphi appears to be a normal fifteen-year-old-girl , she is controlled through a satellite linked to P . Burke \\'s brain , which is still physically located in her original body . The Remote and the Operator The purpose of a remote and a remote operator , such as Delphi and P . Burke , is to remove the fear a company might have that a normal celebrity could act of their own accord . P . Burke controls Delphi , making her say and do whatever the company tells her to . That being said , after months of training , Delphi is strategically placed in a minor documentary film , and she becomes a media sensation overnight . Her job is to act as a celebrity traveling all over the world , all the while subtly buying and promoting products to influence the public in favor of a company . A Harsh Reality P . Burke not only falls in love with the life style , but Delphi as well . Acting as a perfect teenage girl , P . Burke has everything she has ever wanted . She has fame , respect , wealth , power , and eventually love . Paul Isham , the rich and rebellious son of a network executive , notices Delphi on the set of her Soap Opera and falls in love with her . P . Burke - and , by default , Delphi - reciprocates his feelings , but can not let him know the truth . He eventually discovers and misunderstands the situation , believing Delphi is a normal girl who is enslaved by implants . He breaks into the lab where P . Burke is and is shocked to see Delphi being controlled by an unattractive , bedridden woman connected to countless machines . Out of rage and confusion , he rips the wires out of P . Burke , killing her . Delphi remains biologically \" alive \" and is put under the control of another operator . Analysis The underlying discussions that take place in relation to \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" tend to focus on the female body and gender embodiment . In her article titled \" \" Whatever It Is that She \\'s Since Become \" : Writing Bodies of Text and Bodies of Women in James Tiptree Jr. \\'s \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" and William Gibson \\'s \" Winter Market \" \" , Heather J . Hicks puts focus on Tiptree \\'s take on female embodiment in the form of P . Burke . Tiptree uses phrases like \" pumped-out hulk \" , \" girl brute \" and \" carcass \" to devalue P . Burke , which further increases her feeling of uselessness in the story . This negative version of female embodiment is shown in contrast to the positive embodiment seen through Delphi , who is described as \" flawless \" and \" beautiful \" . The juxtaposition of these two bodies allows for a discussion on the way different types of bodies function within the context of society presented throughout the story . Different Types of Bodies Two different types of bodies are presented throughout the story . Heather J . Hicks explains that Delphi is the body with value , while P . Burke is seen as the opposite . This obsession with perfection is seen through the use of celebrities , including Delphi , as advertisements . Her beauty gives her influence over the population , which in turn gives her opportunities that P . Burke will never have . Only through the proxy of Delphi can P . Burke be valued in society . Hicks explores this idea further , saying \" P . Burke welcomes the chance to shed the ignominious flesh and bone that have caused her so much suffering \" in order to become more valued . This means that P . Burke is willing to get rid of her own physical body in order to move up in society because she understands that it will never happen any other way . Social status within this society is so dependent on perfection and beauty that those who do not fall into that category want to move into better bodies . Hicks says this is precisely what gender disembodiment means within the context of \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" . Gender of the Author There is an obvious relationship between the gender of the author and the message of the story . Hicks explains that Tiptree uses P . Burke as a metaphor for herself . The author , whose real name is Alice Bradley Sheldon , uses the male pen name of James Tiptree Jr . in order to be successful in the world of science fiction . Hicks says Sheldon \" becomes P . Burke , which powers the public persona that consumers desire \" . Not only does Sheldon use a male pen name , but her writing style is viewed as masculine as well . This further contributes to the gender embodiment that Tiptree tries to undertake . Like those in the story , consumers in the science fiction world want a body image that represents what they deem worthy . In the story , people want an idealized female body , and in the real world science fiction consumers want a male body producing their stories . Hicks says the way in which P . Burke is ousted by Paul \" suggests a conviction that her own body of work would not endure the revelation of her female body \" . In this method of analyzing the situation , Tiptree is suggesting that by writing this story she can not be successful as a science fiction writer in her own body . Melissa Stevenson sums up this point in her article \" Trying to Plug In : Posthuman Cyborgs and the Search for Connection \" by saying that \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" \" is a tale of transformations and masks , the story of a girl who is not who she seems to be , written by an author who is not exactly who \" he \" seemed to be \" . A Male Author for a Male Audience One notable characteristic of \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" is how the author used a male narrator to tell the story to a predominantly male audience in order to play with the readers expectations of how the story will pan out . The story is being told by way of a male narrator most likely to a 1970 \\'s male science fiction consumer . The story continuously being told through a male point of view comes to highlight issues that male readers might have when reading this short story . According to Stevenson , Tiptree utilizes this way of telling the story in order to influence male readers expectations of P . Burke and of the ways the story will turn out upside down . The narrator rebukes the reader on several occasions for having these false expectations . Stevenson gives an example of this with the actual attempted suicide of P . Burke on the park bench . The narrator chastises the reader because he is not interested in P . Burke but rather the surrounding city . The expectation here is that the life of the ugly P . Burke is relatively unimportant compared to the surroundings to the targeted male reader . Stevenson points out that after this , the reader is rebuked three different times for not focusing on P . Burke but each time this happens , the narration is moved to descriptions of the futuristic soundings , presumably in accord with what the male reader truly desires to read about . This goes back to what Heather J . Hicks states about the importance and success of the ideal feminine body compared to the non-ideal feminine body . P . Burke ’ s body is considered unimportant and the way the story is written and paced suggests just that . The Performance of Gender Another theme of The Girl Who Was Plugged In is the performance of gender . According to Veronica Hollinger , this story is about P . Burke ’ s pursuit of the ideal feminine body . P . Burke desperately wants to achieve this ideal body , but she can not due to her physical appearance . According to Hollinger , P . Burke is performing the gender ideal through a distance by controlling Delphi . Hollinger states that P . Burke ’ s performance here gives her an opportunity that she would not otherwise have given her real body to “ mimic acceptable femininity \" . She also says that P . Burke “ is the divinely feminine Delphi as long as she performs Delphi . P . Burke is the actor and Delphi is her role ” . This performance was P . Burke ’ s way to a fairy-tale ending . Delphi can only be feminine if she were to be performed in a feminine way . Hollinger ’ s entire analysis can be seen in parallel with the analysis of Heather J . Hicks when she discusses how P . Burke uses Delphi to push herself up in the ranks of society . In order to have more opportunities in the society presented , P . Burke must perform femininity through Delphi . Literary criticism on the portrayal of the body The depiction of the body in \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" has been discussed by several feminist literary scholars . Amongst them are Scott Bukatman , Melissa Colleen Stevenson , Veronica Hollinger and Heather J . Hicks . Major themes in \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" , as seen in the aforementioned authors articles referenced in this section , include disembodiment and re-embodiment , performance of femininity , oppression of the female body by cultural power structures and the female body in a technological society . Constructed Ideal of Femininity Veronica Hollinger , co-editor of the scholarly journal \" Science Fiction Studies \" of DePauw University , states in her article , \" ( Re ) reading Queerly : Science Fiction , Feminism , and the Defamiliarization of Gender \" , that women are forced to conform to a constructed ideal of femininity in order to avoid being seen as a failure or , to some extent , incomplete . To Hollinger , \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" is about the ways women experience pressure from society to fulfill the set standards of femininity as seen in P . Burke \\'s desperate desire to fully leaving her real body and re-embody permanently as Delphi . In a society where the only way to achieve happiness is by conforming completely to a constructed ideal , P . Burke has little choice but to live through the perfect girl body that is Delphi . Heather J . Hicks reinforces Hollinger \\'s views in her article \" ” Whatever It Is That She ’ s Since Become ” : Writing Bodies of Text and Bodies of Women in James Tiptree , Jr. ’ s “ The Girl Who Was Plugged In ” and William Gibson ’ s “ The Winter Market ” \" by stating that P . Burke denies her unappealing , real body . Hollinger sees P . Burke as a representation of the body that is utterly insignificant in the eyes of society . She discusses \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" in terms of how gender can act as a form of imprisonment when society expects an unrealistic display of femininity ) . P . Burke \\'s existence becomes meaningful only when her mind controls the beautiful but \" empty \" body called Delphi , thus the female body in meeting with technology creates a separation between the body and the mind where P . Burke \\'s only way of fulfilling the feminine beauty ideal is at the hands of technology . The futuristic world in which Tiptree Jr . stages her story has taught P . Burke to idolize the ideal that \" the Gods \" embody and so P . Burke willingly commits the act of \" performing femininity \" . Description of P . Burke Another way disembodiment and oppression of the female body is seen in \" The Girl Who was Plugged In \" is by the words used to describe the main character , i.e . the description of P . Burke . Early in the story Tiptree says , “ That ’ s good , because now you can see she ’ s the ugly of the world . A tall monument to pituitary dystrophy . No surgeon would touch her . ” In the opinion of Scott Bukatman , of Stanford University , Tiptree forms the body into something unclean and decaying through phrases such as \" dead daddy \" , \" rotten girl \" and \" zombie \" . Hicks suggests the use of crude words for the main character only gets worse as the story progresses to emphasize an unappealing display of female disembodiment . According to Bukatman , the body in \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" is a dominating and central figure , but it also serves to represent a definite limitation . This relates to Hollingers statement of P . Burke \\'s re-embodiment as Delphi becoming an actor/role relationship where P . Burke imagines herself as an actor that must fulfill a role , i.e . Delphi . This is a clear parallel to our own society \\'s failure to recognize the individual women as separate from the constructed cultural ideal of femininity . Stevenson \\'s view is that , to the deformed and shunned P . Burke , her life as Delphi is the only one that is actually real , because her original body left her excluded from the \" human \" category in the eyes of society , making her unable to form emotional connections or experience love until her re-embodiment as Delphi . Consequently , P . Burke feels more human as Delphi than as herself because society finally accepts and recognizes her existence . In other words , P . Burke is dependent on technology to be able to participate in society . Relationships between Women and Technology While Hollinger reads \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" through the ideological lens of gender as a performance , Hicks believes Tiptree connects female disembodiment with women \\'s relationship to technology . Delphi , who was made for the sole purpose of advertising , is the living example of the perfect woman , and through her work for GTX she participates in reinforcing the cultural ideal of the femininity she \\'s created after . In Hicks opinion , \" Delphi \\'s body is used in a capitalistic aim for the purpose of advertising to such an extent that her body becomes synonym with the products she advertises \" . However , Stevenson points out that , while Delphi is beautiful , she does not have an identity without the connection to P . Burke , which means they are both dependent on each other in order to function in society . Bukatman also argues that the act of merging with a machine , like P . Burke merges with Delphi , is , in feminist science fiction , an act of defeat , as opposed to the romanticized approach of cyberpunk where it is seen as necessary and a source of power . Bukatman points out that technological advances in science fiction are synonym with the furthering of a patriarchal power structure , as seen in the control of the female body in \" The Girl Who Was Plugged In \" . Bukatman states ; \" In this sense , Tiptree \\'s title refers to the state of being plugged in to male definitions of the feminine image and being ; plugged in to the power structures of male technology . \" . He also points out the negative impact of altering your identity in Tiptree \\'s story , and states that it serves as a symbol of oppression rather than liberation from society \\'s conventions . P . Burke and Delphi vs . Sheldon and Tiptree Stevenson and Hicks both discuss the interesting and noteworthy parallel between P . Burke and Delphi and Alice Sheldon and her pseudonym , James Tiptree Jr . Stevenson points out that by writing under a male pseudonym , Sheldon was able to obtain a more \" attractive \" exterior with which she could connect to the male dominant science fiction writing community . Hicks believes that Sheldon herself may have experienced a form or disembodiment where she could only fulfill the ideals of the science fiction community by assuming a male persona . By the numerous ways Tiptree has touched on essential feminist topics in a single short story , it becomes clear why she was one of the most prominent feminist science fiction writers of her time .

The specifics of the rule differ between the two major codes . Rugby union Offside laws in rugby union are complex . However the basic principle is simple : a player may not derive any advantage from being in front of the ball . When the ball is carried by a single player in open play , any other player on the same team who is in front of the ball carrier is in an offside position . When the ball is in a ruck , maul , scrum or line-out , any player who is in front of the hindmost foot of the hindmost player of the same side in the ruck/maul/scrum/lineout is in an offside position . When the ball is in a scrum , the scrum-half must remain behind the ball and all other players not in the scrum must remain behind a line parallel to the goal-line and five metres behind the hindmost foot . A player in an offside position is forbidden from interfering with play in any way . In particular , a player in an offside position may not receive a pass ( forward passes are illegal in any event ) may not enter a ruck , maul or scrum may not play the ball may not move towards the ball may not move towards , tackle or obstruct a player of the opposing team who has the ball , or who is waiting to receive the ball must move at least 10 metres away from any opponent who is waiting to receive the ball Infringement of any of these rules is generally punished with a penalty awarded to the opposing team . The opposing team may choose instead a scrum at the location where the offending team last played the ball . However , if the infringement was accidental ( e.g . a player receives a forward pass without intending to be in an offside position ) then a scrum is awarded at the location of infringement . A player who is in an offside position remains offside until played onside in one of several ways : a teammate who has remained onside runs ahead of the offside player ( this may be either the ball carrier/kicker or another teammate who has remained behind the ball carrier/kicker ) the offside player runs behind the ball carrier/kicker an opponent at least 10 metres away from the offside player kicks , passes , intentionally touches , or runs 5 metres with the ball At a lineout only players in the line ( normally 7 per team ) , a receiver ( often the scrum-half ) and a thrower ( usually the hooker ) from each team are allowed within 5 metres of the line , however the defending hooker must be at least 2 metres from the line so as not to disturb the other thrower . The remaining players must be more than 10 metres away from the line or they will be penalised . They may move closer only to catch a long throw-in , or after the line-out ends , when the ball or a player carrying it leaves the lineout in any direction . If a player kicks the ball , out of hand , from the dead ball area , players can be in front of the kicker , as long as they do not leave the dead ball area before the ball has been kicked . Rugby league A defending player is offside if they are less than 10 metres away from the play-the-ball ( or , if the play-the-ball is inside his 10-metre line , closer to it than the try-line is ) when the ball is played . He is also offside if , during open play , he is closer to the opposition 's try-line than the ball . At a scrum a defending player is also offside if he is less than 5 metres away from the base of the scrum . An attacking player is offside if he is in front of the ball : if he is in front of a ball which is then kicked , he can be put onside if the kicker subsequently moves ahead of him before the ball is caught . If not , he must stand 10 metres away from the player who catches the ball ( as if he were the acting half-back at a play-the-ball ) or be penalised .

The majority of characters listed here unless noted otherwise have appeared in multiple books under various plotlines . Oz is made up of four divisions that surround the Emerald City in the center . The country as a whole was originally enchanted by a character named Queen Lurline , who is described in the Oz backstory . Additional characters were added in regions surrounding The Land of Oz ( beyond the deserts ) as the series progressed . Aside from the humans and Dorothy \\'s pets , the characters here are each listed under what division they are most associated with in the storyline or storylines . Humans and pets Aunt Em and Uncle Henry Aunt Em and Uncle Henry appear in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . They are Dorothy Gale \\'s guardian aunt and uncle . They live a joyless and gray life on a small farm on the prairies of Kansas . Neither of them believe their niece when she tells them she has been to the Land of Oz ; they consider her a mere dreamer , as her dead mother had been . This changes when the two later face foreclosure on their farm . Dorothy arranges with Princess Ozma to bring them to Oz , so that they can escape their bleak fates and be safe and finally content . Eventually , in The Emerald City of Oz , they move permanently to Oz and take up jobs there . Betsy Bobbin Betsy Bobbin is a fictional character in L . Frank Baum \\'s Land of Oz . Betsy is portrayed with various hair colors throughout the series ; in her initial appearances her hair was colored as blonde , strawberry blonde or light brown . Later appearances depicted her as brunette or with auburn hair . Betsy first appears in Baum \\'s 1913 stage play The Tik-Tok Man of Oz , and then in his 1914 novel Tik-Tok of Oz , wherein she teams up with the Shaggy Man and together they go to the Nome King \\'s Caverns . In the book series Betsy arrives to Oz from Oklahoma with a mule named Hank , and she is shown as a constant companion of both Dorothy and Trot in the later books . In The Lost Princess of Oz she is said to be one year older than Dorothy Gale . Betsy is more passive than Dorothy , and in one book she is described as shy . Betsy was later made a Princess of Oz by Ruth Plumly Thompson , and she also appears as the protagonist of Thompson \\'s The Hungry Tiger of Oz in which she helps a young prince from a kingdom called Rash regain his throne . Button-Bright Button-Bright ( real name : Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith ) is a character who first appears in the 1909 book The Road to Oz . When Button-Bright first appears , he is shown as a little boy who answers most questions with \" Do n\\'t know . \" In the story Button \\'s head is temporarily changed into a fox \\'s head by King Dox of Foxville ; upon arriving in the Land of Oz , Billina and Tik-Tok took Button-Bright to the Truth Pond so that he could regain his head . He later makes an appearance at Princess Ozma \\'s birthday party . Baum brought Button-Bright back for his 1912 novel Sky Island , where he encounters Trot and Cap\\'n Bill for the first time . In this novel he is shown to be older and more verbal . Button reveals that he is from Philadelphia , and that his real name is Saladin Paracelsus de Lambertine Evagne von Smith . He was given the nickname \" Button-Bright \" by his parents as his name is rather long , and because they think that he is \" bright as a button \" . In The Scarecrow of Oz ( 1915 ) , Button-Bright becomes the first American to accidentally emigrate to the Land of Oz . In the sequel Oz books , he is often the main character in subplots that deal with him getting lost and being found again . In the non-canon stories of March Laumer , Button-Bright is depicted as an adult and married to Glinda . Button-Bright appears in Return to Oz in the background at Princess Ozma \\'s coronation . Cap\\'n Bill Cap\\'n Bill Weedles is a fictional character who first appears in two of Baum \\'s fantasy novels , The Sea Fairies ( 1911 ) and Sky Island ( 1912 ) . Bill was introduced along with his friend Trot ; they both later appear in The Scarecrow of Oz ( 1915 ) which is the ninth book in the Oz series . Cap\\'n Bill Weedles is an ex-sailor with a wooden left leg from the knee down . His head is almost bald and what little hair he has is grizzled . His eyes are pale blue with a gentle look to them , and his face is round , rugged , and bronzed . He has been Trot \\'s companion from birth as he was her mother \\'s star boarder . Formerly he was captain of a schooner with Trot \\'s father as his mate ; after losing his leg , the Cap\\'n retired , and Trot \\'s father was promoted to captain of the same ship . Cap\\'n Bill and Trot also play significant roles in the later Oz books The Lost Princess of Oz ( 1917 ) , The Magic of Oz ( 1919 ) and The Magical Mimics in Oz ( 1946 ) . Baum borrowed from one of his own earlier characters , Naboth Perkins in Sam Steele \\'s Adventures on Land and Sea ( 1906 ) , to create Cap\\'n Bill . Cap\\'n Bill appears in Return to Oz , in the background at Princess Ozma \\'s coronation , holding the Magic Flower . Dorothy Gale Dorothy Gale is the main character and adolescent protagonist in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ( 1900 ) and several sequel Oz books . She is a heroic and sweet-tempered orphan girl from a small farm on the prairies of Kansas . Baum never reveals Dorothy \\'s age , but she is thought to be no older than twelve years old . In appearance she is described as having chubby little hands , a round rosy face , big earnest eyes filled with awe and a merry laugh . She has a small pet dog she calls Toto , whom she loves dearly . After her first adventure in the Land of Oz , she returns to Kansas via the charmed Silver Shoes ( Ruby Slippers in the classic MGM musical of 1939 ) she obtained while there but lost between worlds when she was teleported back . Not much later , she unexpectedly returns to Oz again , thus having several more adventures before permanently settling there as an official princess of Oz in the book The Emerald City of Oz ( 1910 ) . Billina Billina is Dorothy \\'s pet hen on the Kansas farm and first appears in the book Ozma of Oz , in which she saves the citizens of Oz from being turned into decor objects by the evil Nome King . She is sassy and talkative ; at the conclusion of Ozma of Oz , Billina chooses to stay in Oz and live in the Emerald City \\'s royal palace , later becoming the matriarch of a large colony of chicks . She is a major character in Walt Disney \\'s 1985 live-action film Return to Oz , in which she helps Dorothy save the Land of Oz from near extinction . Eureka Eureka is a white kitten who is introduced in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz . She is found by Uncle Henry who gives her the name Eureka , which means \" I have found it ! \" Henry then gives the cat to his niece Dorothy making the cat her pet . Dorothy carries Eureka in a small birdcage on a train with her to San Francisco to visit her relatives on Hugson farm . While riding with Bill Hugson \\'s nephew Zeb , an earthquake opens a large chasm in the ground , and Eureka falls with Dorothy , Zeb , and Jim the Cab-Horse into the land of the Mangaboos , people made of vegetable . The strange lights in the Mangaboos \\' cavern create all sorts of odd colors , and Eureka looks pink there . Eureka is then referred to as a \" pink kitten , \" or sometimes , as in Glinda of Oz , as a \" purple kitten . \" The last third of Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz presents her as dishonest , and she is placed on trial for having eaten the smallest of the Nine Tiny Piglets , which was given to Princess Ozma as a pet . Eureka is threatened with execution until the piglet is finally found . Although Eureka ultimately tells them where the piglet is , she is amused at being tried for something that is in her nature to attempt . Eureka returns with Dorothy to Kansas , but is later found living in Oz with no explanation of how she returned . Eureka may be conniving and deceitful , but overall she has a good heart . Eureka plays a significant supporting role in Dick Martin \\'s 1986 novel The Ozmapolitan of Oz , and she is the heroine of Chris Dulabone \\'s The Colorful Kitten of Oz ( 1990 ) which , among other things , addresses the inconsistency of Eureka \\'s color . Eureka appears in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz voiced by Kari Wahlgren . She is a resident of Purrville who becomes friends with the Cowardly Lion . Toto Toto is Dorothy \\'s pet dog , and he appears in most of the same books as Dorothy , beginning with The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . Due to his appearance in the 1939 film , he has often been ranked near the top of list of on-screen canine characters . Shaggy Man The Shaggy Man is a kind old wanderer who is dressed in rags . He is also shown to have an unnamed brother who is simply dubbed Shaggy Man \\'s Brother He was a gold miner in Colorado until he ended up in the Nome Kingdom and was taken prisoner by the Nome King who imprisoned him in the Metal Forest . After finding out about his brother \\'s plight 10 years later , Shaggy Man led some of his friends to the Nome Kingdom to rescue him . Afterwards , Princess Ozma allowed him to live in the Land of Oz . Trot Mayre \" Trot \" Griffiths is a young girl who comes to Oz in The Scarecrow of Oz , along with her friend Cap\\'n Bill , and becomes a friend and companion of Dorothy , Ozma and Betsy . She is also the protagonist of The Sea Fairies and Sky Island . Zeb Hugson Zebediah Hugson is a boy who is a distant cousin of Dorothy Gale , apparently related through Dorothy \\'s Aunt Em . He works for his uncle , Bill Hugson , at Hugson \\'s Ranch in California , where he also lives . Zeb appears in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz ( 1908 ) . Zeb first meets Dorothy at Hugson \\'s Siding , when he picks her up in a carriage pulled by Jim the Cab-horse . On their way to the Hugson \\'s Ranch , an earthquake causes everyone to fall into the earth and into the Land of the Mangaboos . Zeb , Dorothy , Jim , and Dorothy \\'s kitten Eureka are soon joined by Oscar Diggs aka the Wizard of Oz . The travelers undertake a subterranean journey through the Valley of Voe , are briefly imprisoned in the Land of Naught , and encounter a cavern full of Dragonettes . Despite his reservations about being in a strange land , Zeb courageously defends his friends and helps them escape from the Land of Gargoyles by obtaining pairs of gargoyle wings . After Ozma uses the Magic Belt to bring them to the Land of Oz , Zeb is welcomed as an honoured guest in the Emerald City . During the festivities held to celebrate the arrival of Dorothy and her friends , Zeb participates in a wrestling match with a Munchkin boy , which he loses , and then a boxing match , which Zeb wins . He later serves as one of the nine members of the jury during the trial of Eureka . While the Wizard accepts Ozma \\'s invitation to remain in Oz , Dorothy , Zeb , and their animals decide to return home . Though Zeb remarks that Oz is a nice country , he admits that he and Jim feel out of place in a fairy country and wishes to return to Hugson \\'s Ranch with Jim . Zeb \\'s last evening in Oz is described as being so wonderful , he never forgot it as long as he lived . In The Oz Kids , he somehow came back to Oz and married Dorothy . The both of them had two children named Dot and Neddie Hugson . Hank Hank is a mule that is the pet and companion of Betsy Bobbin . Emerald City The following characters are associated with the central portion of Oz known as the Emerald City . Guardian of the Gates The Guardian of the Gates is a character in several of the Oz books . He is never known by any other name , but he is depicted as a singular character who lives in a small room , based on its description significantly larger than a standard guardhouse , in the wall that surrounds the Emerald City . In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ( 1900 ) and The Marvelous Land of Oz ( 1904 ) , his job is to adorn green spectacle glasses around the heads of all visitors to the Emerald City before they enter . This is done to protect their eyes from the thousands of glittering green gems within the city that are so precious and rare , they would cause blindness without the spectacles . The glasses can only be unlocked by a solid gold key that the Guardian always wears on a thick gold chain around his neck . After The Marvelous Land of Oz he abandoned the practice , for General Jinjur \\'s Army of Revolt and Tippetarius had all entered the city without damage to their eyes . The spectacles were the idea of the Wizard of Oz to make the city appear greener than it actually is . The Guardian of the Gates appears only occasionally after this book , and his duty becomes significantly lighter . In The Patchwork Girl of Oz ( 1913 ) when Ojo the Lucky reaches the city , he and his companions are taken into the Guardian \\'s room , where the Soldier with the Green Whiskers tells the Guardian of the Gates that he has a note from Ozma that Ojo is to be taken prisoner . So the Guardian of the Gates removes the traditional prison garb , a white robe that completely covers the prisoner , from a closet and places it on Ojo and leaves the Soldier with the Green Whiskers in charge of him . In John R . Neill \\'s Oz books , the Guardian of the Gates and the Soldier with the Green Whiskers are frequently shown as friends , but the subsequent books of Jack Snow give the duty to Omby Amby ( the Soldier \\'s name ) , and there is no entry for the Guardian of the Gates in Snow \\'s Who \\'s Who in Oz . In Neill \\'s The Scalawagons of Oz , the Guardian mentions a desire to visit his cousin , Oompa , which may explain , in-universe , why Omby Amby is fulfilling that function . Further confusion is created in the MGM movie , in which both roles are played by Frank Morgan , and publicity referred to the Guardian \\'s equivalent as \" the Doorman \" and the Soldier \\'s equivalent as \" the Guard \" . No other Guardian of the Gates is described in any of Baum \\'s books , aside from a stout woman who takes over the function during Jinjur \\'s rule . In The Marvelous Land of Oz musical , in which the role was originated by Steve Huke , the Guardian is conflated± with the man interviewed doing housework , and he also claims to have a wife and ten children , a claim not made by anyone in the book . The Guardian of the Gates had his own eponymous song , written in bass clef , in The Wizard of Oz musical extravaganza , by Baum and composer Paul Tietjens , but it was cut after only two performances and never made it to Broadway , although the sheet music was published for consumer use . In the 1939 adaption of The Wizard of Oz , the Guardian of the Gates appears as the \" Gatekeeper \" portrayed by Frank Morgan ( who also portrays Professor Marvelous , the Wizard of Oz , the Emerald City Coachman , and the Guard ) . When Dorothy , Toto , Scarecrow , Tin Man , and Cowardly Lion reach the Emerald City , they ring on the bell which alerted the Gatekeeper . When he notices that there is no sign near the bell and puts it up before closing the door \\'s window where it says \" Bell out of order . Please knock . \" They knock which pleases the Gatekeeper and were able to persuade him into letting them go to the Wizard by showing the Ruby Slippers that Dorothy has . The Gatekeeper lets them into the Emerald City . In The Muppets \\' Wizard of Oz , Sam the Eagle portrays \" the Gate Guard . \" In The Wiz Live ! , Common portrays \" The Bouncer / The Gatekeeper Of The Entrance To The Emerald City . \" Jellia Jamb Jellia Jamb , aka the \" pretty green girl \" , is the head maid of the Emerald City \\'s royal palace . She first appears in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ( 1900 ) and is first named in The Marvelous Land of Oz ( 1904 ) . Jellia Jamb is portrayed as a rather sweet and organized girl when on duty , but mischievous and playful when off duty . She is said to be very pretty , with green hair and green eyes . King Pastoria King Pastoria was the rightful King of Oz until he was removed from power by Mombi . He is the father of Princess Ozma . Princess Ozma Princess Ozma is the ruler of Oz since the end of the second book , and she has appeared in every book except the first . Prior to the second book , she had been transformed by the evil Mombi into a young boy named Tip . In many of the books , she is depicted as a fairy princess of fourteen or fifteen years of age , though she was originally portrayed as not a fairy and much younger . She is the title character in Ozma of Oz and The Lost Princess of Oz , and The Road to Oz is about a journey to her birthday party . In Jack Snow \\'s Murder in Oz , Ozma \\'s Tip persona reclaims his life , causing Ozma to die , and the Wizard has to find a way to have both Tip and Ozma alive and well at the same time . Soldier with the Green Whiskers The Soldier with the Green Whiskers is Oz \\'s one-man army . He appears in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz ( 1900 ) and the many sequel books . He is portrayed as having a very long green beard and carrying an unloaded rifle . He is alternately referred to as Omby Amby or Wantowin Battles .

In the non-canon story Gugu and the Kalidahs , Gugu and his fellow inhabitants had to work to fight off renegade Kalidahs from the neighboring area . Gugu has a bear named Bru , and a gray ape named Rango as his councilors . Lonesome Duck The Lonesome Duck is a character in The Magic of Oz ; he makes brief but gaudy appearances in two of the book \\'s later chapters .

He swims \" swiftly and gracefully \" over to them , astonishing them with his \" gorgeously colored plumage \" . In a brief conversation , the Duck explains why he is lonesome . Though he can not help free the two protagonists from their entrapment , he makes it slightly easier to bear , by conjuring large magic toadstools for them to sit on . Later , the rescue party searching for Trot and Cap\\'n Bill almost stumbles over the Lonesome Duck \\'s diamond palace , earning them a stern rebuke from its inhabitant . The text never specifies the Duck \\'s gender ; the creature is consistently referred to as \" it . \" Yet the general rule among birds is that the males are gaudier than the females . Mombi Mombi is one of the series \\' major antagonists . The character was originally presented as a lowly hag who had enchanted Princess Ozma in order to prevent her from ascending to the throne . Mombi first appears The Marvelous Land of Oz , when Tip escapes her power . Later in the series , L . Frank Baum specified that she had once conquered and ruled the Gillikin Country as the Wicked Witch of the North only to be deposed by the Good Witch of the North . It is revealed that she helped install the Wizard as ruler of Oz . She makes several more appearances in the Oz books before she , in a similar fate to her predecessor , the Wicked Witch of the West , is melted in \" The Lost King of Oz . \" Mr . Yoop Mr . Yoop is a giant from The Patchwork Girl of Oz . He is a 21 ft . giant with a ravenous appetite for meat people and an orange marmalade . Mr . Yoop ate cows and sheep and sometimes knocked over people \\'s houses which led to him being apprehended and imprisoned in a mountain cage . Since his imprisonment , he has only eaten six ants and a monkey . He threatens passers-by : \" They tell me meat is going up , but if I can manage to catch you , I \\'m sure it will soon be going down . \" The book The Tin Woodman of Oz revealed that he is the estranged husband of Mrs .

She is the estranged wife of the imprisoned Mr . Yoop from The Patchwork Girl of Oz , who has been imprisoned for eating people . Unlike him , Mrs . Yoop is not a cannibal ; she obtains food by means of her magical powers . The Green Monkey Spell proves irreversible and has to be transferred to somebody else . In this case Mrs . Yoop who becomes , and must now stay , a green monkey . She is a Yookoohoo , a special kind of witch , \" an Artist of Transformations \" whose enchantments are extremely powerful . The other Yookoohoo in the Oz books is Red Reera in Glinda of Oz . Both Yookoohoos are specialists in magical transformations and are solitary , anti-social , and fiercely independent The Tin Woodman of Oz is a rarity in Baum \\'s Oz canon , in that the author \\'s manuscript of the book exists , and reveals the changes that Baum made for the printed version . Baum revised his original to make Mrs . Yoop more sinister ; and he originally called Mrs . Yoop a \" Whisp \" ( an otherwise unknown term in the universe of Oz ) rather than a Yookoohoo . Sawhorse The Sawhorse , spelled \" saw-horse \" in some of the books , is a character from L . Frank Baum \\'s Oz books series . He first appears in The Marvelous Land of Oz .

He is a log with a notch cut in one end for a mouth , two knots for eyes and a branch for a tail . When he was first made he had no ears and could not follow directions , so Tip corrected that by carving him some ears from tree bark . He also had a post installed on his back so Jack could hold on while riding . His friends deride him as the least intelligent member of their party , though he usually has intelligent things to say when he speaks . The sawhorse is one of the fastest creatures in Oz because he never gets tired . He carries Glinda in her pursuit of Mombi into the Deadly Desert while the latter is in the form of a gryphon . Princess Ozma has his legs shod with plates of gold to keep his legs from wearing out . In The Marvelous Land of Oz , Baum emphasizes the awkwardness with which the sawhorse walks , tottering one way and then the other because his legs do not bend , and front and hind move together . In Ozma of Oz , he is described as walking as well as a real horse . However , he approaches the Giant with the Hammer too quickly and sends his rider Omby Amby up to the giant \\'s arm . This knocks off his ears and leaves him deaf until they can be replaced . He is integral in defeating the Nome King , kicking him with his hind legs in order to protect Dorothy Gale . In later Oz books , he is frequently shown drawing Ozma \\'s Red Wagon . One example is shown in Dorothy of Oz where he is enlisted by Glinda to carry Dorothy to her palace and then to the palace of Princess Gaylette .

At the banquet in the Emerald City at the end of Ozma of Oz , he acknowledges that he is finally full . The Hungry Tiger was introduced in Ozma of Oz as one of Ozma \\'s chariot drivers ( the other being the Cowardly Lion ) , though Jack Snow and others believe he may be \" the biggest of the tigers \" in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . In Chapter 18 of The Patchwork Girl of Oz , he is described as \" the largest and most powerful of its kind , \" and having come from the forest where the Cowardly Lion ruled , which could be taken as an indirect statement that he is the same tiger that appeared in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz .

Although in The Marvelous Land of Oz , has this invention credited to another crooked magician named Dr . Nikidik from the Gillikin Country . In an article in the Spring 1965 issue of The Baum Bugle , Lee Speth argues that Nikidik faked his death in the earlier book , to assume a new identity as Pipt .

Unfortunately , she was a ward to the Wicked Witch of the East , who made Fyter \\'s sword do what the Woodman \\'s axe did and cut off his limbs , which Ku-Klip the tin smith replaced with tin limbs ( although Fyter is not bothered by his lack of a heart ) . Nimmie Amee agreed to marry him , but on the day of their wedding , a storm rose up , and the rain rusted Fyter so badly that he was frozen in place along a little used forest path . There he stood for years until he was discovered by the Tin Woodman , the Scarecrow , Woot the Wanderer , and Polychrome the Rainbow \\'s Daughter .

He is the son of Bini Aru who learned the transformation magic by saying the magic word \" Pyrzqxgl . \" When Princess Ozma made a decree that limits who can learn magic , Kiki discovered the words and used it to turn into a hawk where he flew to the Land of Ev . After being reprimanded by a sparrow for stealing a coin in the form of a magpie , Kiki was approached by the former Nome King Ruggedo who ropes Kiki into helping him with his plot . Transforming themselves into birds , Kiki and Ruggedo flew to the Land of Oz to avoid being detected by the Great Book of Records . Upon transforming themselves into Li-Mon-Eags ( creatures with the head of a lion , the body of a monkey , the wings of an eagle , and the knob-tipped tail of a donkey ) who claim to be from Sky Island , Kiki and Ruggedo spread the rumors to the animals of the Forest of Gugu that the humans of Oz plan to harm their forest . This was thwarted by the Wizard who used the magic word to turn Kiki and Ruggedo into different nuts . After being restored to normal , Kiki and Ruggedo were hit with a thirst-inducing magic and drank from the forbidden fountain where they lost their memories and their evil intentions . Ku-Klip Ku-Klip is a character who is the originally unnamed tinsmith in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz who provided Nick Chopper with tin prostheses when the latter was cursed to dismember himself by the Wicked Witch of the East because of his love for the servant Nimmie Amee . In The Tin Woodman of Oz , we are introduced to a soldier named Captain Fyter , who met with the same fate due to his interest in Nimmie Amee , and Ku-Klip did the same for him . After the witch was destroyed by Dorothy Gale \\'s house , Ku-Klip entered the witch \\'s house and took some of her magical devices , including a magic glue . He had thrown Chopper and Fyter \\'s discarded body parts into a barrel , and decided to use this glue ( originally referred to as \" Meat Glue \" in early editions of the book , but later changed ) to assemble the parts from two men into a man called Chopfyt , but he finds he must substitute a tin arm as well . Nimmie Amee marries the assemblage and appears to be quite happy , but Princess Ozma takes the witch \\'s tools away from the smith so that he can not create any more unnatural beings . Ku-Klip continues to keep Nick Chopper \\'s flesh head , who finds the Tin Woodman \\'s claim to be him ludicrous , in a cabinet . Nimmie Amee Nimmie Amee is the Munchkin maiden whom the Tin Woodman once loved in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . She was not named until The Tin Woodman of Oz , as Nick Chopper never went to find her after the Wizard gave him a \" kind \" but not a \" loving \" heart , until that novel \\'s protagonist , Woot the Wanderer , encouraged him to do so . In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , the Tin Woodman tells Dorothy Gale and the Scarecrow that the lady was a servant for an old woman who did not wish her to marry , and so sought the aid of the Wicked Witch of the East to place a spell on him that caused him to cut himself up with his axe while carrying on his livelihood . In The Tin Woodman of Oz , this was retconned , and in Nick \\'s new telling , she was directly enslaved by the Witch herself . Nimmie Amee was aware of the spell , which occurred gradually , and was not bothered by his condition and still wished to marry him , but he lost interest when he lost his heart ( In Wizard , he lost his heart after his head ; in Tin Woodman , he lost his head last and the Witch ran around with it in her arms ) . Soon a soldier named Captain Fyter also wooed the lady , and the Witch dealt him the same blow , and he sought help from the same tinsmith , Ku-Klip . Fyter \\'s head and parts of Nick and his body were incorporated into Chopfyt , a new person , through the use of magic glue found in the Witch \\'s house . Ku-Klip was unable to find one arm , so he fashioned one out of tin . In this way , Chopfyt reminded her of both the men she loved , and she married him , and Baum presented them as a happy couple at the end of the novel , although Princess Ozma forbade Ku-Klip from ever doing such a thing again . This character is totally absent in the 1939 musical film . Ojo the Lucky Ojo the Lucky is a Munchkin who appears in several Oz books , including The Patchwork Girl of Oz and Ojo in Oz . Patchwork Girl The Patchwork Girl , aka Scraps , appears in several Oz books beginning with The Patchwork Girl of Oz . She is a life-size doll made out of various patches like those on a patchwork quilt . The book revolves around her being created by Margolotte and brought to life by the magic substance called the Powder of Life , that was created by Margolotte \\'s husband Dr . Pipt . She was filled with a mixture of character traits . Originally intended to be an unquestioning humble slave , she comes to life as a rather zany acrobatic person with a tendency to break into spontaneous poetry , all thanks to Ojo the Unlucky messing with the formula for her \" brain furniture \" and joining the adventure to find an antidote for petrification . In later books , she is often paired with the Scarecrow , being his main love interest . Phonograph The Phonograph ( also referred to as The Troublesome Phonograph ) is a character who appeared in The Patchwork Girl of Oz . It originally belonged to Dr . Pipt , until it was inadvertently brought to life when it was accidentally sprinkled with the Powder of Life . The Phonograph has a large gold-colored horn , and is screwed to a tall , four-legged table , which it uses for movement . Once alive , it continued to bother the magician by playing loud and offensive \" classical \" music until it was at last forced from his home . It then tried to endear itself to the young Munchkin boy Ojo and his friends in much the same way ( first with classical , then jazz ) , but was finally scared off by the Shaggy Man , who threatened to \" scatter its pieces across the country , as a matter of kindness to the people of Oz . \" The Phonograph has never been seen since .

One day , the teacher found and caught him , and decided to use him for an impromptu lesson on woggle-bugs . Nowitall put the bug under a microscope and projected his highly magnified image onto a screen with advanced technology . The bug was proud of his new size ; he bowed to the students , and one unnamed little girl standing on the windowsill was startled and fell backward out of the window .

Oogaboo is the smallest and poorest kingdom in Oz , despite the cultivation of trees which produce many items of value . Rak The Rak is a flying fictional creature from the pages of Tik-Tok of Oz . The Rak is described as a large winged creature with glowing red eyes that can fly in the air , run like a deer , and swim like a fish . Inside its body is a glowing furnace of fire which allows the creature to breathe out smoke . Its smoky breath blankets the surrounding area like a thick , black fog with an aroma of salt and pepper . It is bigger than a hundred men and feeds on any living thing . Like most other animals in the land of Oz , the Rak can speak . The Rak \\'s vague descriptions given in the storybook lead one to believe that the Rak is a type of dragon . In Tik-Tok of Oz , the Rak is briefly encountered by Queen Ann Soforth and her army and wounded by gunfire . Although its jaw , wing and leg are broken by the attack , the Rak does not die , as everything in the land of Oz lives an enchanted life and can not die . The Rak appears in Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz . Scarecrow The Scarecrow first appears in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , when he joins Dorothy to go to the Wizard in search of brains . When the Wizard leaves Oz , he makes the Scarecrow ruler , a position he holds until the middle of the second book . Later , he moves to a corn-shaped house in the Winkie Country . The Scarecrow appears in many of the later books , including The Scarecrow of Oz ( where he is the title character ) and The Royal Book of Oz ( where he researches his ancestry ) . He was played by Ray Bolger in the 1939 movie . That actor also played the Scarecrow \\'s Kansan counterpart , Hunk , who was one of Aunt Em and Uncle Henry \\'s three farmworkers . Tin Woodman The Tin Woodman first appears in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , joining Dorothy \\'s quest to see the Wizard in order to get a heart . He had originally been a human by the name of Nick Chopper , but gradually his human parts had been replaced with metal ones . After the Wicked Witch of the West is defeated , he becomes Emperor of the Winkies . He appears in many later Oz books , often alongside his friend the Scarecrow . In the eponymous Tin Woodman of Oz he searches for his lost love . Ugu the Shoemaker Ugu the Shoemaker is the villain of The Lost Princess of Oz He is morally ambiguous rather than pure evil ; Baum states that Ugu \" did not know he was wicked \" . He was once a shoemaker in Herku , located in the Winkie Country , until he discovered the magic recipes of his ancestors . Thereupon , he decided to become a powerful sorcerer and take possession of the Land of Oz as its ruler . He moved away from Herku and built a Wicker Castle in the west of the Winkie Country . After stealing the Magic Dishpan from Cayke , he used it to steal Glinda the Good Witch \\'s Magic Book of Records , the Wizard \\'s Black Bag of Magic and , ultimately , he kidnapped Princess Ozma in the process and hid her in the form of an Enchanted Peach Pit . He was finally defeated by Dorothy Gale , who used the Nome King \\'s Magic Belt to transform him into a dove . Realizing how much damage he had done , he only asked to remain a peaceful dove and apologize to Dorothy . Wicked Witch of the West The Wicked Witch of the West originated as the primary villain and main antagonist of L . Frank Baum \\'s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz book , in which she is given no name . She is described as being completely blind in one eye , and there is no mention of her having green skin . She rules the western quadrant called Winkie Country in the Land of Oz and enslaved many of the natives . She also owns a pack of killer wolves , black crows and stinging bees . When Dorothy Gale and company are sent by the Wizard to defeat her , she sends her collection of deadly pets to kill them but is unsuccessful . She then uses the Golden Cap to call upon the Winged Monkeys who destroy the Scarecrow and Tin Woodman , but capture Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion . She imprisons them in her castle before Dorothy melts her with a bucket of water when the Wicked Witch tried to steal one of her Silver Shoes . After her death in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz , The Wicked Witch of the West is rarely referred to again in the later Oz books . She is known as Evillene in the 1975 Broadway musical The Wiz originated by Mabel King , and reprised in the 1978 film adaptation of the same name . Of all stage , film and animated productions of the Oz story , The Wiz follows Baum \\'s book the most closely , and therefore she has no green skin . Under the name Elphaba , she is the protagonist of the Gregory Maguire novel and Winnie Holzman/Stephen Schwartz 2003 musical Wicked , and is born green due to an elixir given by her father ( the Wizard of Oz ) to her mother ( the wife of the governor of Munchkinland ) during their adulterous affair . Discovering that she has real powers , the Wizard of Oz orders her arrest when she refuses to aid him in his terroristic control of Oz , and she is declared a wicked witch by the Wizard \\'s press secretary , Madame Morrible . Believing that the governor of Munchkinland is her real father , she is devastated when Glinda gives Dorothy the slippers of her sister Nessarose which had been given her by the governor and which she herself had cast a spell on to enable the disabled Nessarose to walk . Desperate to get these precious family heirlooms back from Dorothy , they confront one another at the castle of Prince Fiyero , Elphaba \\'s love interest , but is doused by the girl with a bucket of water . This kills her in the Maguire novel . It merely burns her in the musical – and she uses her feigned death as a way to escape with Fiyero , whom she had turned into the Scarecrow to prevent him from being tortured by the Wizard \\'s soldiers . Outer lands Braided Man The Braided Man is a bent-over old man with his hair and beard in braids who lives halfway up Pyramid Mountain . He is a great inventor who used to live on the surface of the Earth where he worked with holes until a big one caused him to fall deep underground where he landed on Pyramid Mountain and lived on its spiral staircase since . Since then , he has amused himself by making Flutters and Rustlers . He first appears in Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz where he meets Dorothy and the Wizard of Oz when they arrive at his cave and he gives them some of his products . While he states that there is no use of money on Pyramid Mountain , he does accept Dorothy \\'s blue bow . In The Road to Oz , the Braided Man appears to have made it back to the surface as he was among the guests at Princess Ozma \\'s birthday party . His present to Princess Ozma is the finest Flutters that he has made . The Braided Man appears in Return to Oz . He made a background appearance at the coronation of Princess Ozma . Ervic Ervic is a major character in Glinda of Oz . Displaying \" courage , cleverness , and ingenuity , \" Ervic is often considered one of Baum \\'s strongest male characters ( as the author \\'s male characters often tend to be ineffectual ) . When Queen Coo-ee-oh launches her submarine attack on the Flatheads , Ervic is one of the young men in her flagship . The Flatheads quickly dispatch with Coo-ee-oh , as they simply wanted revenge on her personally , but as she is the only one who knows the magic to get back to the submerged city , the young men sit in the boat , unsure what to do . Ervic is approached by the Three Adepts at Magic who are stranded in the form of fish . They wish him to catch them in a bucket and to follow their instructions , and that if he does so , he will save himself , his city , and his companions . They help him get the boat to shore and have him carry the bucket to Reera the Red . Reera is a beautiful young woman who practices Yookoohoo ( transformation-only ) magic for her own amusement . Reera is interested by his impertinence with her , and Ervic very shrewdly manipulates her into restoring the Adepts to human form , taking quite a bit of time and waiting for her to ask permission to transform them several times . The Adepts are able to assist the raising of the city , and with Coo-ee-oh gone , Lady Aurex is named Queen of the Skeezers by Princess Ozma , and for his valiance , Aurex names Ervic her Prime Minister . Evoldo Evoldo is the late king of the Land of Ev , a monarchy across the Deadly Desert from Oz . He is discussed and pictured in Ozma of Oz , but has died before the adventure takes place . Evoldo was a cruel despot ; after purchasing Tik-Tok , the clockwork man , and giving him his name , Evoldo sold his wife and ten children ( five boys , five girls ) to the Nome King in exchange for a long life . Later , regretting this bargain , he locked Tik-Tok in a stone chamber and committed suicide by jumping into the Nonestic Ocean .

He was originally charged with taking Dorothy home from the train station by pulling a carriage driven by Dorothy \\'s cousin Zeb Hugson . When a giant earthquake occurs , Jim and the occupants of his carriage fall deep into the earth and into the Land of the Mangaboos . As they enter a fairy country , Jim gains the ability to speak . Throughout most of the book , Jim pulls the buggy that carries Dorothy , Zeb , and the Wizard of Oz . He is occasionally unhitched from his carriage when it is too cumbersome for the carriage to be pulled or when the travellers must rely on Jim \\'s powerful hooves to fight against creatures such as gargoyles . Upon arriving in Oz , he is regarded as an oddity because nobody has ever seen a flesh-and-blood horse ; the only horse they have seen is the Saw-horse . He is treated as an honoured guest in the Emerald City and becomes somewhat haughty , bragging that he was a fast racehorse in his youth . However , his pride is hurt after losing a race to the Saw-horse and frequently asks Zeb when they will be able to return to Hugson \\'s Ranch . His wish is granted at the end of the book , when Ozma uses the magic belt to return Zeb and Jim to California . Kaliko Kaliko is a Nome and lives in the Nome Kingdom , where he is , at least to start off with , the Chief Steward to his sadistic master , the Nome King Roquat the Red . Kaliko is first encountered in Ozma of Oz , though he is identified only as the Chief Steward . In the book , Dorothy \\'s pet hen Billina overheard an argument between Kaliko and Roquat , and learned the secret . She was able to set the prisoners free . In The Emerald City of Oz , Roquat the Red plans to attack the Emerald City in revenge for his humiliation ; we see Kaliko only very briefly . The character of Kaliko is in his prime in Tik-Tok of Oz . Kaliko become king after old Ruggedo ( whose name was changed from Roquat ) was expelled from his kingdom by the Great Jinjin Tititihoochoo for tipping some members of a Rescue Expedition from Oz down a Hollow Tube and straight into the Land of the Fairies , which is under the governorship of Tititihoochoo . Kaliko promises to become a good king and offers to assist in rescuing the Shaggy Man \\'s brother . Ruggedo returns to the Nome Kingdom , and Kaliko takes him in upon Ruggedo \\'s promise to be good . Kaliko has a brief role in Rinkitink in Oz , where he helps the cruel King Gos and Queen Cor hide the captive rulers of Pingaree from their \" wizard \" son Prince Inga and his friend Rinkitink of Gilgad . Kaliko is essentially a good-natured person still , but refuses to surrender the prisoners upon Inga \\'s arrival as he feels himself bound to his promise made to Gos and Cor . However , Dorothy and the Wizard arrive from Oz and force Kaliko to give up the prisoners . Kaliko makes some more appearances in the later Oz books of Ruth Plumly Thompson , where he appears to have changed from a \" good \" Nome into a cruel Nome who harbors plans to rule Oz for himself , and adds himself to the list of Princess Ozma \\'s enemies . He , like all other Nomes , is afraid of eggs ; and once he becomes king , he is a self-confessed \" powerful sorcerer . \" King of the Fairy Beavers The King of the Fairy Beavers appears in Baum \\'s John Dough and the Cherub and reappears in Jack Snow \\'s The Shaggy Man of Oz . The King of the Fairy Beavers rules an underground kingdom . In both books , he helps the travelers to reach their final destination . Nome King The Nome King ( also referred to as Roquat , and later Ruggedo ) is the evil and humorously stubborn ruler of an underground kingdom inhabited by the race of gnome minions , creatures who are half human and half rock . His mountain stands between the Land of Oz and the Land of Ev and is separated from both these two countries by the vast Deadly Desert . He appears in Ozma of Oz and several of the sequel Oz books . His evil plans usually involve kidnapping the rulers of Oz or taking over the universe . Even after he is deposed and defeated in Tik-Tok of Oz , he continues to make trouble for the inhabitants of Oz and all the Ozians in general . After a number of attempts on Oz \\'s peace and happiness , he meets his final canonical fate in Handy Mandy in Oz . Princess Langwidere Princess Langwidere appears in Baum \\'s third Oz book Ozma of Oz ( 1907 ) as a secondary villain . She is the vain and spoiled princess whom Dorothy and her company encounter when she visits the Land of Ev which neighbors Oz . Langwidere has a collection of 30 exchangeable heads she keeps in a cabinet constructed of solid gold and studded with gems . The cabinet itself is held within a walk-in closet in the boudoir of Langwidere \\'s palace . Each head is said to be extremely beautiful , consisting of different bone structures that represent different ethnicities and are kept in their own separate cases lined with mirrors that Langwidere keeps locked with a ruby key she wears around her left wrist . Instead of changing her clothing like most princesses , she simply changes her heads to match her current state of mood whenever she pleases . She is portrayed as being a very reclusive and selfish creature , with a terrible temper when she wears Head # 17 . In Return to Oz , elements of Princess Langwidere were combined with the witch Mombi and is named Princess Mombi instead . She is an ally of the Nome King .

In the final battle , Princess Langwidere is defeated by Glinda . Princess Langwidere also appears as a recurring character in Emerald City portrayed by Stefanie Martini . She appears as the main antagonist in Lost in Oz voiced by Gina Gershon . This version is depicted as the evil aunt of West , most likely based loosely on the Wicked Witch of the East .

Shortly after she is introduced , as an arrogant girl of about fifteen or sixteen , who proclaims herself the only Krumbic witch in the world , for she invented the art , the Su Dic of the Flatheads attacks her island kingdom , and she leads the defense aboard a submarine that opens into a boat . There a bucket of enchanted water is dumped upon her , and she becomes a vain , diamond-eyed swan with no memory of her magical abilities . Her sudden transformation leaves her domed city stranded beneath the waters of the lake , as only she knew the spell .

Quox Quox is a dragon with an electric light attached to his tail who is a descendant of the Original Dragon and first appeared in Tik-Tok of Oz .

The Gump The Gump is an amalgam of parts with the mounted head of an elk-like creature , first brought to life with the magic Powder of Life in The Marvelous Land of Oz ( 1904 ) .

After crashing into a jackdaw \\'s nest , Wogglebug used a Wishing Pill to fix him . After the Land of Oz is retaken by Princess Ozma , the Gump is disassembled at his request leaving him a talking head that is still living in the Royal Palace of Oz .

He sometimes acts in his own interests , at least to the extent of making sure his are met when he aids others , such as suggesting an apple for rescuing Nuphsed , which does n\\'t work , but when he is fed the apple , he gives an answer that does . Somehow , he was able to cross the Deadly Desert that surrounds Oz and he took up residence with the Foolish Owl who originally resided in Munchkin Country . The Wise Donkey states that he was visiting on the day Oz was cut off from the rest of the world and was unable to return home . He is seen dusting his house when he is visited by Ojo , Scraps , and Bungle . The Wize Donkey believes that someone as wise as he is should find the Foolish Owl unique and amusing .

Sláine is a barbarian fantasy adventure series based on Celtic myths and stories that first appeared in 1983 , written by Pat Mills and initially drawn by his then wife , Angela Kincaid . Most of the early stories were drawn by Massimo Belardinelli and Mike McMahon . Other notable artists to have worked on the character include Glenn Fabry and Simon Bisley . The current artist is Simon Davis . Sláine \\'s favourite weapon is an axe called \" Brainbiter \" . He has the power of the \" warp spasm \" , based on the ríastrad or body-distorting battle frenzy of the Irish hero Cú Chulainn , in which earth power \" warps \" through his body , turning him into a terrifying , monstrously powerful figure . He is a devotee of the earth goddess Danu . Plot Sláine is a wanderer who is banished from his tribe , the Sessair . He explores the Land of the Young ( Irish : Tír na nÓg ) with an unscrupulous dwarf called Ukko , fighting monsters and mercenaries . In one early adventure he rescues a maiden , Medb , from being sacrificed in a wicker man , only to earn her enmity – she was a devotee of Crom Cruach , the god to whom she was to be sacrificed , and was looking forward to the experience . Her master and mentor , the ancient , rotting and insane Lord Weird Slough Feg , becomes the series \\' main villain . Sláine encounters sky chariots ( flying longships ) , dragons and prehistoric alien gods . Sláine returns to his tribe and becomes king , leading them against the Fomorians , a race of sea demons who were oppressing them . In The Horned God , Sláine unites the tribes of the earth goddess against Slough Feg and his allies , while his personal devotion to the goddess leads to him becoming a new incarnation of the Horned God Carnun ( based on the Gaulish deity Cernunnos ) . By the end of the story the Land of the Young is no more , and Sláine is the first High King of Ireland . In subsequent stories , Sláine is sent through time by Danu to fight alongside other heroes and heroines such as Boudica ( with whom he fought against the Romans , Elfric , and William Wallace ) , and returns to Ireland to defend his people against new enemies alongside his wife Niamh . These new enemies turn out to be a full Fomorian invasion led by Balor and Moloch , murdering , raping , and eating their way through Sláine \\'s tribe until he is able to defeat Balor . The tribal council forces Sláine to let Moloch go , hoping he would fulfill his promise of keeping the Fomorians out of Ireland ; instead , he returns to rape and murder Niamh . Wanting vengeance , Sláine abdicates the throne , and goes to Albion , killing Moloch . In his absence , his son Kai leaves the tribe to search for his father ( eventually becoming a performer in an Albion carnival ) and Ireland faces a second invasion – \" the dread of Europe \" , Atlanteans whose ancestors had lived in Ireland before the tribes of Danu , and who had been forcibly turned into hosts – Golamhs – for the symbiotic Sea Demons under Lord Odacon ( an offshoot of the Fomorians ) . When Sláine returns , he finds the new High King Sethor , former member of the council who had granted Moloch freedom , was willing to surrender half of Ireland to Odacon in return for the gifts of science and civilisation . Sláine convinces the tribal council that the demons could be killed and war is once more declared on the invaders , but it was clear that Ireland would be constantly attacked by wave after wave of Fomorian invasion . Sláine suggests having the Tribe of Danu escape to the Otherworld that their Sky Chariots had been sent to in order to free them from the demons , and allow the Atlanteans to settle peacefully in Ireland . Both armies unite against Odacon and his Sea Demons . Sláine is able to free the Atlantean leader Gael from being Odacon \\'s Golamh by handing over Sethor to take Gael \\'s place , and they lead their armies to bolster the city of Tara . While the tribes fight a defensive battle , Sláine is sent to the Otherworld to secure Danu \\'s blessings for the Tribes of the Earth Goddess to settle there . He returns with her power behind him and leads a charge that decimates Odacon \\'s forces . The Tribe is cast into the Otherworld in the aftermath , and Sláine assists Gael in finally destroying Odacon and the parasitic spawn with which he had infested the outer-lying villages . With Gael as High King of Ireland and founder of the eventual Gaelic race , Sláine leaves to track down his son . He finds Kai at a travelling funfair , and later embarks on a quest to track down Crom Dubh . Sources and influences Sláine \\'s most obvious sources are Robert E . Howard \\'s Conan the Barbarian and Cú Chulainn , the hero of the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology . Mills derived much of the series \\' background from Celtic mythology and European prehistory ( as did Howard : the name Conan is Irish and is borne by a number of mythological figures ) . Sláine himself is named after Sláine mac Dela , the first High King of Ireland , and his \" warp-spasm \" or body-distorting battle frenzy is derived from the ríastrad of Cúchulainn ; \" warp-spasm \" is the term Thomas Kinsella used for ríastrad in his translation of The Táin . His barbed spear , the gae bolga , is also borrowed from Cú Chulainn , though his favourite weapon , the axe , is more usually associated with the Vikings or Anglo-Saxons than the Celts . His patronymic , Mac Roth , is the name of the steward of Ailill and Medb , king and queen of Connacht , in the same cycle . The death of Sláine \\'s mother , Macha , who was forced to run on foot in a chariot race because of her husband \\'s boasting , is taken from the story of an Irish goddess called Macha . Sláine \\'s seduction of Niamh , the king \\'s chosen bride who was brought up in seclusion until she was of age , is reminiscent of the Irish story of Deirdre . Cathbad , the druid who foretells the evil consequences of Deirdre \\'s birth and appears in several other tales of the Ulster Cycle , gives his name to Sláine \\'s chief druid . Sláine \\'s feat of crossing a raging river to visit her , weighed down by a heavy stone to prevent him from being swept away , is taken from an episode of the Táin. < ref > \" On the morrow a valiant hero called Úalu went and took a great flagstone on his back to go across the water . But the river turned him over and he lay with his stone on his belly . His grave and his headstone are on the road beside the stream . Lia Úalann is its name . \" ( from [ http : //www.ucc.ie/celt/online/T301012/text001.html Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension 1 ] , ed . & trans . Cecile O\\'Rahilly , p . 153 < /ref > Niamh is a popular Irish girl \\'s name , and is also the name of a fairy queen from the Fenian Cycle . Her otherworld homeland , Tír na nÓg ( the Land of the Young ) , provides the name of the series \\' setting . Sláine \\'s goddess , Danu , and her tribes , the Tuatha Dé Danann , come from the Irish Mythological Cycle , though the worship of a universal mother goddess of the earth is not Celtic , and comes from speculations about prehistoric European culture and religion by people like Marija Gimbutas and Robert Graves . The Horned God , Carnun , is adapted from the Gaulish antlered deity Cernunnos . Some of the religious ideas in the series are taken from Barddas , a possibly fraudulent compilation of \" bardo-druidic \" beliefs by the 18th-century Welsh antiquarian Iolo Morganwg . Mills divides the priests of Tir na nÓg into two factions : the good Druids , the well known priestly class of Celtic Europe , and the evil Drunes , whose name derives from the Galatian place-name Drunemeton ( \" oak-sanctuary \" ) used in the story \" The Bride of Crom \" as the name of the Drunes \\' capital . Their leader , Slough Feg , is partly based on Cernunnos and partly on the paleolithic cave painting known as the Sorcerer in the Trois-Frères cave in Ariège , southern France . His acolyte , Medb , is named after the legendary queen of Connacht from the Ulster Cycle . The Drunes \\' god , Crom Cruach , is an Irish deity who was reputedly appeased with human sacrifices . The practice of mass human sacrifice by burning in a wicker man is mentioned as a practice of the Celts of Gaul by Strabo and Julius Caesar . The enemies of the Tribes of the Earth Goddess , the Fomorians , and their leader Balor , are from the Irish mythological cycle . Other elements of the series are derived from non-Celtic mythological sources . Sláine \\'s dwarf companion is named Ukko , after the Finnish storm god . Odacon is identified in Theosophist circles with a Babylonian deity named Oannes , and is considered closely related to Dagon . Musarus , one of the same species as Odacon , shares this origin . Grimnismal , the name of the dark god Sláine and his companions defeat in \" Tomb of Terror \" , is the title of a poem about Odin from the Norse Elder Edda . The term Ragnarok , for the end of the world , is also borrowed from Norse mythology .

Besides the paternal bonds of a father to his children , the father may have a parental , legal , and social relationship with the child that carries with it certain rights and obligations . An adoptive father is a male who has become the child \\'s parent through the legal process of adoption . A biological father is the male genetic contributor to the creation of the infant , through sexual intercourse or sperm donation . A biological father may have legal obligations to a child not raised by him , such as an obligation of monetary support . A putative father is a man whose biological relationship to a child is alleged but has not been established . A stepfather is a male who is the husband of a child \\'s mother and they may form a family unit , but who generally does not have the legal rights and responsibilities of a parent in relation to the child . The adjective \" paternal \" refers to a father and comparatively to \" maternal \" for a mother . The verb \" to father \" means to procreate or to sire a child from which also derives the noun \" fathering \" . Biological fathers determine the sex of their child through a sperm cell which either contains an X chromosome ( female ) , or Y chromosome ( male ) . Related terms of endearment are dad ( dada , daddy ) , baba , papa , pappa , papasita , ( pa , pap ) and pop . A male role model that children can look up to is sometimes referred to as a father-figure . Paternal rights The paternity rights of a father with regard to his children differ widely from country to country often reflecting the level of involvement and roles expected by that society . Paternity leave Parental leave is when a father takes time off to support his newly born or adopted baby . Paid paternity leave first began in Sweden in 1976 , and is paid in more than half of European Union countries . In the case of male same-sex couples the law often makes no provision for either one or both fathers to take paternity leave . Child custody Fathers \\' rights movements such as Fathers 4 Justice argue that family courts are biased against fathers . Child support Child support is an ongoing periodic payment made by one parent to the other ; it is normally paid by the parent who does not have custody . Paternity fraud An estimated 2 % of British fathers experiences paternity fraud during a non-paternity event , bringing up a child they wrongly believe to be their biological offspring . Role of the father In almost all cultures fathers are regarded as secondary caregivers . This perception is slowly changing with more and more fathers becoming primary caregivers , while mothers go to work or in single parenting situations , male same-sex parenting couples . Fatherhood in the Western World In the West , the image of the married father as the primary wage-earner is changing . The social context of fatherhood plays an important part in the well-being of men and all their children . In the United States 16 % of single parents were men as of 2013 . Importance of father or father-figure Involved fathers offer developmentally specific provisions to their children and are impacted themselves by doing so . Active father figures may play a role in reducing behavior and psychological problems in young adults . An increased amount of father–child involvement may help increase a child \\'s social stability , educational achievement , and their potential to have a solid marriage as an adult . Their children may also be more curious about the world around them and develop greater problem solving skills . Children who were raised with fathers perceive themselves to be more cognitively and physically competent than their peers without a father . Mothers raising children together with a father reported less severe disputes with their child . The father-figure is not always a child \\'s biological father and some children will have a biological father as well as a step- or nurturing father . When a child is conceived through sperm donation , the donor will be the \" biological father \" of the child . Fatherhood as legitimate identity can be dependent on domestic factors and behaviors . For example , a study of the relationship between fathers , their sons , and home computers found that the construction of fatherhood and masculinity required that fathers display computer expertise . Determination of parenthood Roman law defined fatherhood as \" Mater semper certa ; pater est quem nuptiae demonstrant \" ( \" The [ identity of the ] mother is always certain ; the father is whom the marriage vows indicate \" ) . The recent emergence of accurate scientific testing , particularly DNA testing , has resulted in the family law relating to fatherhood experiencing rapid changes . History of fatherhood Many male animals do not participate in the rearing of their young . The development of human men as creatures which are involved in their offspring \\'s upbringing took place during the stone age . In medieval and most of modern European history , caring for children was predominantly the domain of mothers , whereas fathers in many societies provide for the family as a whole . Since the 1950s , social scientists and feminists have increasingly challenged gender roles in Western countries , including that of the male breadwinner . Policies are increasingly targeting fatherhood as a tool of changing gender relations . Research from various societies suggest that since the middle of the 20th century fathers have become increasingly involved in the care of their children . Patricide In early human history there have been notable instances of patricide . For example : Tukulti-Ninurta I ( r . 1243–1207 B.C.E . ) , Assyrian king , was killed by his own son after sacking Babylon . Sennacherib ( r . 704–681 B.C.E . ) , Assyrian king , was killed by two of his sons for his desecration of Babylon . King Kassapa I ( 473 to 495 CE ) creator of the Sigiriya citadel of ancient Sri Lanka killed his father king Dhatusena for the throne . Emperor Yang of Sui in Chinese history allegedly killed his father , Emperor Wen of Sui . Beatrice Cenci , Italian noblewoman who , according to legend , killed her father after he imprisoned and raped her . She was condemned and beheaded for the crime along with her brother and her stepmother in 1599 . Lizzie Borden ( 1860–1927 ) allegedly killed her father and her stepmother with an axe in Fall River , Massachusetts , in 1892 . She was acquitted , but her innocence is still disputed . Iyasus I of Ethiopia ( 1654–1706 ) , one of the great warrior emperors of Ethiopia , was deposed by his son Tekle Haymanot in 1706 and subsequently assassinated . In more contemporary history there have also been instances of father–offspring conflicts , such as : Chiyo Aizawa murdered her own father who had been raping her for fifteen years , on October 5 , 1968 , in Japan . The incident changed the Criminal Code of Japan regarding patricide . Kip Kinkel ( 1982- ) , an Oregon boy who was convicted of killing his parents at home and two fellow students at school on May 20 , 1998 . Sarah Marie Johnson ( 1987- ) , an Idaho girl who was convicted of killing both parents on the morning of September 2 , 2003 . Dipendra of Nepal ( 1971–2001 ) reportedly massacred much of his family at a royal dinner on June 1 , 2001 , including his father King Birendra , mother , brother , and sister . Christopher Porco ( 1983- ) , was convicted on August 10 , 2006 , of the murder of his father and attempted murder of his mother with an axe . Terminology Biological fathers Baby DaddyA biological father who bears financial responsibility for a child , but with whom the mother has little or no contact . Birth fatherthe biological father of a child who , due to adoption or parental separation , does not raise the child or can not take care of one . Biological father or sometimes simply referred to as \" Father \" is the genetic father of a child Posthumous fatherfather died before children were born ( or even conceived in the case of artificial insemination ) Putative fatherunwed man whose legal relationship to a child has not been established but who is alleged to be or claims that he may be the biological father of a child Sperm donoran anonymous or known biological father who provides his sperm to be used in artificial insemination or in vitro fertilisation in order to father a child for a third party female . Also used as a slang term meaning \" baby daddy \" .

Non-human fatherhood For some animals , it is the fathers who take care of the young . Darwin \\'s frog ( Rhinoderma darwini ) fathers carry eggs in the vocal pouch . Most male waterfowls are very protective in raising their offspring , sharing scout duties with the female . Examples are the geese , swans , gulls , loons , and a few species of ducks . When the families of most of these waterfowls travel , they usually travel in a line and the fathers are usually the ones guarding the offspring at the end of the line while the mothers lead the way . The female seahorse ( hippocampus ) deposits eggs into the pouch on the male \\'s abdomen . The male releases sperm into the pouch , fertilizing the eggs . The embryos develop within the male \\'s pouch , nourished by their individual yolk sacs . Male catfish keep their eggs in their mouth , foregoing eating until they hatch . Male emperor penguins alone incubate their eggs ; females do no incubation . Rather than building a nest , each male protects his egg by balancing it on the tops of his feet , enclosed in a special brood pouch . Once the eggs are hatched however , the females will rejoin the family . Male beavers secure their offspring along with the females during their first few hours of their lives . As the young beavers mature , their fathers will teach them how to search for materials to build and repair their own dams , before they disperse to find their own mates . Wolf fathers help feed , protect , and play with their pups . In some cases , several generations of wolves live in the pack , giving pups the care of grandparents , aunts/uncles , and siblings , in addition to parents . The father wolf is also the one who does most of the hunting when the females are securing their newborn pups . Coyotes are monogamous and male coyotes hunt and bring food to their young . Dolphin fathers help in the care of the young . Newborns are held on the surface of the water by both parents until they are ready to swim on their own . A number of bird species have active , caring fathers who assist the mothers , such as the waterfowls mentioned above . Apart from humans , fathers in few primate species care for their young . Those that do are tamarins and marmosets . Particularly strong care is also shown by siamangs where fathers carry infants after their second year . In titi and owl monkeys fathers carry their infants 90 % of the time with \" titi monkey infants developing a preference for their fathers over their mothers \" . Silverback gorillas have less role in the families but most of them serve as an extra protecting the families from harm and sometimes approaching enemies to distract them so that his family can escape unnoticed . Many species , though , display little or no paternal role in caring for offspring . The male leaves the female soon after mating and long before any offspring are born . It is the females who must do all the work of caring for the young . A male bear leaves the female shortly after mating and will kill and sometimes eat any bear cub he comes across , even if the cub is his . Bear mothers spend much of their cubs \\' early life protecting them from males . ( Many artistic works , such as advertisements and cartoons , depict kindly \" papa bears \" when this is the exact opposite of reality . ) Domesticated dog fathers show little interest in their offspring , and unlike wolves , are not monogamous with their mates and are thus likely to leave them after mating . Male lions will tolerate cubs , but only allow them to eat meat from dead prey after they have had their fill . A few are quite cruel towards their young and may hurt or kill them with little provocation . A male who kills another male to take control of his pride will also usually kill any cubs belonging to that competing male . However , it is also the males who are responsible for guarding the pride while the females hunt . However the male lions are the only felines that actually have a role in fatherhood . Male rabbits generally tolerate kits but unlike the females , they often show little interest in the kits and are known to play rough with their offspring when they are mature , especially towards their sons . This behaviour may also be part of an instinct to drive the young males away to prevent incest matings between the siblings . The females will eventually disperse from the warren as soon as they mature but the father does not drive them off like he normally does to the males . Horse stallions and pig boars have little to no role in parenting , nor are they monogamous with their mates . They will tolerate young to a certain extent , but due to their aggressive male nature , they are generally annoyed by the energetic exuberance of the young , and may hurt or even kill the young . Thus , stud stallions and boars are not kept in the same pen as their young or other females . Finally , in some species neither the father nor the mother provides any care . This is true for most insects , reptiles , and fish .

The term is derived from the Greek word ( ) , meaning \" to commit an outrage against someone \" ( ultimately derived from , \" hubris \" ) , and philo , meaning \" having a strong affinity/preference for \" . In popular culture , this phenomenon is also known as \" Bonnie and Clyde syndrome \" . Many high-profile criminals , particularly those who have committed atrocious crimes , receive \" fan mail \" in prison that is sometimes amorous or sexual , presumably as a result of this phenomenon . In some cases , admirers of these criminals have gone on to marry the object of their affections in prison .

In its broadest sense , hybristophilia includes attraction towards partners who displayed dark triad personality traits . Causes Some speculations have been offered as to the cause of hybristophilia . For instance , Katherine Ramsland , who is a professor of forensic psychology at DeSales University mentions that some of the women in particular who have married or dated male serial killers have offered the following reasons : Low self-esteem and the lack of a father figure . \" Some believe they can change a man as cruel and powerful as a serial killer . \" \" Others \\'see \\' the little boy that the killer once was and seek to nurture him . \" \" A few hoped to share in the media spotlight or get a book or movie deal . \" \" Then there \\'s the notion of the \\'perfect boyfriend \\' . She knows where he is at all times and she knows he \\'s thinking about her . While she can claim that someone loves her , she does not have to endure the day-to-day issues involved in most relationships . There ’ s no laundry to do , no cooking for him , and no accountability to him . She can keep the fantasy charged up for a long time . \" Others offered reasons along the lines of : \" Some mental health experts have compared infatuation with killers to extreme forms of fanaticism . They view such women as insecure females who can not find love in normal ways or as \\'love-avoidant \\' females who seek romantic relationships that can not be consummated . \" Psychologist Leon F . Seltzer has offered explanations for the phenomenon of male serial killers attracting female sex partners based on evolutionary psychology . Serial killers , in his view , are cases of alpha males that tend to attract women . This is because such males were good at protecting women and their offspring according to evolutionary history . He says women today may consciously realize that it is unwise to date a serial killer , but they are nevertheless attracted to them ; he stated , \" as a therapist I \\'ve encountered many women who bemoaned their vulnerability toward dominant men who , consciously , they recognized were all wrong for them \" . As evidence of women \\'s fantasy preference for dominant men , he refers to the book A Billion Wicked Thoughts : What the World \\'s Largest Experiment Reveals about Human Desire \" by Ogi Ogas and Sai Gaddam . Seltzer discusses Ogas and Gaddam \\'s argument that this fantasy is the dominant plot of most erotic/romantic books and movies written for women but the fantasy always holds that this male dominance is conditional , \" it does n\\'t really represent the man \\'s innermost reality \" . Historical Jeffrey Dahmer , a serial killer , is said to have had amorous women sending him letters , money , and other gifts during his time in prison despite being a homosexual . Richard Ramirez , the \" Night Stalker \" who killed 13 people and had more than a passing interest in Satanism , had fans who would write him letters and pay him visits . This included Doreen Lioy who married him in California \\'s San Quentin State Prison on October 3 , 1996 .

Statutory disability insurance in the United Kingdom In the UK , people can apply for Disability Living Allowance ( DLA ) if they are under 16 . If they are above 16 , they can apply for Personal Independence Payment ( PIP ) . Disability Living Allowance ( DLA ) DLA is made up of two parts : the care component and the mobility component . The person can get DLA if they are eligible for at least one of the components . The person is eligible for the care component if they can not do everyday tasks ( e.g . washing , dressing , eating , using the toilet etc . ) and there is no one who can care for them or if they live alone . There are three levels : lowest ( for occasional help ) , middle ( for frequent help or constant supervision ) , and highest ( for nonstop supervision ) . The person is eligible for the mobility component if they have a walking disability , have no legs , are blind , are at least 80 % deaf , have behavioural problems or need walking supervision .

State disability insurance in the Czech Republic In the Czech Republic , prior to 2010 , disabled people were divided into two categories based on the seriousness of their disability . These two categories were partial invalidity and full invalidity . Since 2010 , there is just one category of benefits , the invalidity pension , which is divided into three degrees corresponding with the severity of the person \\'s disability . The severity is measured by how disruptive the disability is . An invalid pension can not be collected along with an old-age pension .

The novel follows a handful of rowdy and often sexually promiscuous , spoiled bohemian students at a liberal arts college in 1980s New Hampshire , including three who develop a love triangle . The novel is written in first person narrative , and the story is told from the points of view of various characters . The book was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002 . Ellis has remarked that among film adaptations of his books , The Rules of Attraction came closest to capturing his sensibility and recreating the world of his novels . Plot summary The novel is written in the first-person , continuing the aesthetic of Ellis \\' earlier Less Than Zero , and is told from the points of view of multiple characters . The main narrators are three students : Paul , Sean , and Lauren . A number of other characters also provide first-hand accounts throughout the story , which takes place at the fictional Camden College , a liberal arts school on the East Coast of the United States . The three main characters ( who rarely attend class ) end up in a love triangle within a sequence of drug runs , \" Dressed to Get Screwed \" parties , and \" End of the World \" parties . The story begins and ends midway through a sentence ( the first word in the book being \\'and \\' , the last words are \\'and she \\' ) in order to give the effect that it begins somewhere closer to the middle , rather than at a true beginning ( in medias res ) . Another interpretation is that the story has neither a beginning nor an ending , signifying the endless cycle of debauchery in which the characters of the novel engage . This is sometimes mistaken by readers as a typographical error or the result of a missing page , but was purposely written by Ellis . The novel ends in a similar fashion , with the last sentence cut off before its end . Characters Sean Bateman Sean is a twenty-one-year-old student from a wealthy family . He is very promiscuous and a heavy substance abuser , as well as a drug dealer in the employ of Rupert Guest . He becomes romantically involved with Lauren , a relationship he considers to be true love . It is also implied that Sean is bisexual , as he apparently becomes involved in a sexual relationship with Paul Denton . However , whether these encounters are real or simply a product of Paul \\'s imagination is left ambiguous ; Paul narrates sexual incidents between himself and Sean , while such incidents are absent from Sean \\'s own narration . Sean is very bitter , cynical , and rather dim-witted , and is prone to self-loathing as well . He is also heavily implied to be somewhat of a sociopath , showing incredibly impulsive behavior ( sleeping with Lauren \\'s friend Judy , and at one point , breaking a box of singles he owns for no reason at all ) and having no consideration for other people . He attempts suicide at multiple points in the book , first by hanging , then by slashing his wrist with a dull razor , and then by overdose after a falling out with Lauren . A major subplot in the novel is Sean \\'s debt to Rupert , a violent townie drug dealer who often threatens to kill him . The character is the brother of the notorious Patrick Bateman and has also appeared in Ellis \\'s other novels , American Psycho , The Informers and Glamorama . Lauren Hynde Lauren is a painter and poet who has sexual relations with several boys on campus , all the while pining for Victor , her boyfriend who left Camden and headed to Europe . She is often depressed and very emotional . She is in her senior year at Camden . At the beginning of the novel , it is revealed that Lauren lost her virginity at a party during her freshman year at Camden , where she got so intoxicated that she passed out in bed with another student only to awaken and find herself being raped by a pair of townies . She becomes romantically involved with Sean Bateman halfway through the book , even though she holds Sean in contempt and considers the relationship nothing but a way to pass the time before Victor comes back from Europe . She was also in a relationship with Paul before the events of the book take place . The character reappears as a main character in Glamorama , in which she becomes reacquainted with Victor after having become a successful model and actress . Paul Denton Paul is a young bisexual man who used to date Lauren . He is extremely attracted to Sean and claims that in bed Sean is \" crazed , an untamed animal , it was almost scary \" yet these thoroughly described accounts are entirely absent from Sean \\'s entries . For example , the night Paul writes an account of his and Sean \\'s first sexual encounter after the two talk in Paul \\'s bedroom , Sean writes in his own account that he simply went home after talking to Paul , the two entries therefore lying in contradiction to one another . However , the true details of this relationship remain ambiguous and open to the reader \\'s interpretation . Paul also had relationships with two other important characters , Mitchell and Richard ( Dick ) . Paul is highly intelligent and passionate , but is not above obscuring these facts in the course of seduction . Several characters in the book remark upon his physical attractiveness , brought out by Roman features and soft blond hair . Paul \\'s relationship with his mother , Eve , is complex ; she yearns to reach out to him but is led towards iciness by Paul \\'s flippancy , which in turn feeds their animosity . Supporting characters Victor Johnson – Lauren \\'s boyfriend . Victor took the term off to backpack through Europe . During his time in Europe , he sleeps with many people and abuses many drugs . His entries consist of long diatribes listing his adventures , including a search for a girl named Jaime , who he claims to love . Lauren yearns for him , anxiously awaiting his return , and when he does come back to New Hampshire , he is not interested in seeing her at all . He is the main character in Ellis \\' later novel , Glamorama . Clay – The protagonist of Less Than Zero , aka \" the guy from L.A. \" , who narrates one chapter of the novel . His trademark lines begin \" People are afraid to ... \" . Still unhappy while at Camden , Clay longs to return home to L.A. ; he wishes the reverse in Less Than Zero . Rupert Guest – A violent drug dealer and Sean \\'s supplier . A major subplot in the book is Sean \\'s debt to him . Richard \" Dick \" Jared – An old friend of Paul Denton \\'s who attends Sarah Lawrence College . They are friends with benefits . Patrick Bateman – Sean \\'s older brother , an investment banker who is much more focused and successful than Sean . The brothers loathe each other for their very different outlooks on and approaches to life . He narrates a chapter of the novel and returns as the main character of Ellis \\'s follow-up novel , American Psycho , in which it is revealed that he is a psychopathic serial killer . Sean \\'s admirer – An unnamed student ( although her name is probably Mary ) who sends Sean anonymous love letters . Her entries in the book are all italicized letters to Sean . She hopes to reveal herself to Sean at the Dressed To Get Screwed Party midway through the book , but when she sees him leave with Lauren , she is heartbroken and commits suicide in a bathtub by slashing her wrists . Bertrand – Sean \\'s French roommate , whom he despises . Sean continuously refers to him as \" The Frog . \" He pines for Lauren and narrates one section of the book entirely in French . He also appears in Glamorama with an intense hatred for Victor from the anguish he had caused Lauren . Stuart – A student who moves into the room across from Paul Denton . He previously had a crush on Paul when they shared a drama class , from which Stuart subsequently withdrew after he botched a scene with Paul . He later hopes to run into Paul after he moves across the hall , and hopes ( unsuccessfully ) to see him at the Dressed to Get Screwed Party . He also has a friend named Dennis . Mitchell Allen – A previous fling of Paul \\'s who has reverted into the closet . He later reappears in Ellis \\' Lunar Park . Roxanne - A friend of Lauren \\'s who , like Sean , gets drugs from Rupert . Roxanne dates Rupert during the novel and Sean states that he was also seeing her at one point . Judy - A friend of Lauren \\'s who sleeps with Sean after a party , which ruins Sean and Lauren \\'s relationship . Setting of the novel The story is set at Camden College , a fictional liberal arts college in northeastern New Hampshire . In many ways , Camden mirrors Ellis \\' alma mater , Bennington College , and Hampden College , the setting of Donna Tartt \\'s novel The Secret History . Both books contain cross-references to each other \\'s story lines and characters , as well as mention of actual campus buildings . Tartt mentions the suicide of a freshman girl in passing , while Ellis repeatedly mentions a group of classics majors who \" dress like undertakers \" and are suspected of staging pagan rituals and slaying farmers in the countryside ( a reference to The Secret History ) . There is also mention of a \" nice girl from Rockaway \" in one of Lauren \\'s narrations . This is possibly Alex from Jill Eisenstadt \\'s novel From Rockaway , who attended Camden College in the novel . Film The Rules of Attraction was adapted into a film of the same name in 2002 . It was directed by Roger Avary and starred James Van Der Beek as Sean , Shannyn Sossamon as Lauren , Ian Somerhalder as Paul , and Kip Pardue as Victor .

References Cultural property of national significance in the canton of St . Gallen', 'Men who have sex with men ( MSM ) , also known as males who have sex with males , are male persons who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex , regardless of how they identify themselves . They may identify as gay , homosexual , bisexual , pansexual , or heterosexual ; or dispense with sexual identification altogether . The term MSM was created in the 1990s by epidemiologists to study the spread of disease among all men who have sex with men , regardless of identity , to include , for example , male prostitutes . The term MSM is often used in medical literature and social research to describe such men as a group for research studies without considering issues of self-identification . It does not describe any specific sexual activity , and which activities are covered by the term depends on context . As a constructed behavioral category The term MSM had been in use in public health discussions , especially in the context of HIV/AIDS , since 1990 or earlier , but the coining of the initialism by Glick et al . in 1994 \" signaled the crystallization of a new concept . \" This behavioral concept comes from two distinct academic perspectives . First , it was pursued by epidemiologists seeking behavioral categories that would offer better analytical concepts for the study of disease-risk than identity-based categories ( such as \" gay \" , \" bisexual \" , or \" straight \" ) , because a man who self-identifies as gay or bisexual is not necessarily sexually active with men , and someone who identifies as straight might be sexually active with men . Second , its usage is tied to criticism of sexual identity terms prevalent in social construction literature which typically rejected the use of identity-based concepts across cultural and historical contexts . The Huffington Post postulates that the term MSM was created by Cleo Manago , the man who is also credited for coining the term same gender loving ( SGL ) . MSM are not limited to small , self-identified , and visible sub-populations . MSM and gay refer to different things : behaviors and social identities . MSM refers to sexual activities between men , regardless of how they identify , whereas gay can include those activities but is more broadly seen as a cultural identity . Homosexuality refers to sexual/romantic attraction between members of the same sex and may or may not include romantic relationships . Gay is a social identity and is generally the preferred social term , whereas homosexual is used in formal contexts , though the terms are not entirely interchangeable . Men who are non-heterosexual or questioning may identify with all , none , a combination of these , or one of the newer terms indicating a similar sexual , romantic , and cultural identity like bi-curious . In their assessment of the knowledge about the sexual networks and behaviors of MSM in Asia , Dowsett , Grierson and McNally concluded that the category of MSM does not correspond to a single social identity in any of the countries they studied . There were no similar traits in all of the MSM population studied , other than them being males and engaging in sex with other men . In some countries , homosexual relationships may be illegal or taboo , making MSM difficult to reach . As applied to transgender individuals The term \\'s precise use and definition has varied with regard to trans women , people born either biologically male or with ambiguous genitalia who self-identify as female . Some sources consider trans women who have sex with men to be MSM , others consider trans women \" alongside \" MSM , and others are internally inconsistent ( defining transgender women to be MSM in one place but referring to \" MSM and transgender \" in another ) . Prevalence Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult . Worldwide , at least 3 % of men have had sex at least once with a man . In the U.S. , among men aged 15 to 44 , an estimated 6 % have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives , and about 2.9 % have had at least one male sexual partner in the previous 12 months . Sexual practices Historically , anal sex has been popularly associated with male homosexuality and MSM . However , many MSM do not engage in anal sex , and may engage in oral sex , frotting or mutual masturbation instead . Among men who have anal sex with other men , the insertive partner may be referred to as the top , the one being penetrated may be referred to as the bottom , and those who enjoy either role may be referred to as versatile . Number of sexual partners A 1978 Study , before the AIDS pandemic , found that around 28 % of male homosexuals reported having more than 1000 partners and only 26 % reported having less than 100 partners . A 2007 study reported that two large population surveys found \" the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women . \" According to the 2013 NATSAL ( a representative population study in the UK ) MSM typically had 17 lifetime sexual partners ( median ) , which included all forms of sexual contact including oral and anal sex . An epidemiological article in The BMJ reported that national probability surveys like the NATSAL have been found to better reflect the population of MSM but are limited by their smaller samples of MSM . Convenience sample surveys recruit larger samples of MSM but tend to over-represent MSM identifying as gay and reporting more sexual risk behaviors . Health issues Sexually transmitted infections Among men who have anal sex with other men , anal sex without use of a condom is considered to be high-risk for STI transmission . A person who inserts their penis into an infected partner is at risk because sexually transmitted diseases ( STDS/STIs ) can enter through the urethra or through small cuts , abrasions , or open sores on the penis . Also , condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex . Thus , even with a condom , anal sex can be risky . HIV/AIDS Acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) is a disease of the human immune system caused by the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . HIV can infect anybody , regardless of sex , ethnicity , or sexual orientation . Worldwide , an estimated 5–10 % of HIV infections are the result of men having sex with men . However , in many developed countries , more HIV infections are transmitted by men having sex with men than by any other transmission route . In the United States , \" men who have had sex with men since 1977 have an HIV prevalence ( the total number of cases of a disease that are present in a population at a specific point in time ) 60 times higher than the general population \" . In 2007 , the largest estimated proportion of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adults and adolescents in the U.S . were men who have sex with men ( MSM ) . While this category is only 2 % of the U.S . population they accounted for 53 % of the overall diagnoses and 71 % among men . According to a 2010 federal study , one in five men who have sex with men are HIV positive and nearly half do not realize it . According to a CDC study , HIV prevalence in the MSM population of the U.S . varies widely by ethnicity . \" As many as 46 % of black MSM have HIV \" while \" the HIV rate is estimated at 21 % for white MSM and 17 % for Hispanic MSM . \" In the United States from 2001 to 2005 , the highest transmission risk behaviors were sex between men ( 40–49 % of new cases ) and high risk heterosexual sex ( 32–35 % of new cases ) . HIV infection is increasing at a rate of 12 % annually among 13–24-year-old American men who have sex with men . Experts attribute this to \" AIDS fatigue \" among younger people who have no memory of the worst phase of the epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s , as well as \" condom fatigue \" among those who have grown tired of and disillusioned with the unrelenting safer sex message . The increase may also be because of new treatments . In developing countries , HIV infection rates have been characterized as skyrocketing among MSM . Studies have found that less than 5 % of MSM in Africa , Asia , and Latin America have access to HIV-related health care . HIV prevention with PrEP Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is the use of medication to prevent HIV transmission in people who have not yet been exposed to the virus . When used as directed , PrEP has been shown to be highly effective , reducing the risk of contracting HIV up to 99 % . , numerous countries have approved the use of PrEP for HIV/AIDS prevention , including the United States , South Korea , France , Norway , Australia , Israel , Canada , Kenya , South Africa , Peru , Thailand , the European Union and Taiwan . New Zealand was one of the first countries in the world to publicly fund PrEP for the prevention of HIV in March 2018 . Other sexually transmitted infections Men who have sex with men are at a higher risk of acquiring hepatitis B and hepatitis A through unprotected sexual contact . The U.S . CDC and ACIP recommend hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination for men who have sex with men . About a third of the world \\'s population , more than 2 billion people , have been infected with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Hepatitis B is a disease caused by HBV which infects the liver and causes an inflammation called hepatitis . Syphilis ( caused by infection with Treponema pallidum ) is passed from person to person through direct contact with a syphilis sore ; these occur mainly on the external genitals , or in the vagina , anus , or rectum . Sores also can occur on the lips and in the mouth . Transmission of the organism occurs during vaginal , anal , or oral sex . In 2006 , 64 % of the reported cases in the United States were among men who have sex with men . This is consistent with a rise in the incidence of syphilis among MSM in other developed nations , attributed by Australian and UK authors to increased rates of unprotected sex among MSM . Genital human papillomavirus ( HPV ) is a common virus that most sexually active people in the U.S . will have at some time in their lives . It is passed on through genital contact and is also found on areas that condoms do not cover . Most men who get HPV of any type never develop any symptoms or health problems . Some types of HPV can cause genital warts , penile cancer , or anal cancer . MSM and men with compromised immune systems are more likely than other men to develop anal cancer . The incidence of anal cancer among HIV‐positive MSM is nine times higher than among HIV‐negative MSM , even in antiretroviral therapy . HIV-negative MSM has a higher incidence than the general population . Men with HIV are also more likely to get severe cases of genital warts that are hard to treat . Though not commonly classified as an STI , giardiasis can be transmitted between gay men , and it can be responsible for severe weight loss and death for individuals who have compromised immune systems , especially HIV . Mental health According to the U.S . Centers for Disease Control , the majority of gay and bisexual men have and maintain good mental health , though research has shown that they are at greater risk for mental health problems . Stigma and homophobia can have negative consequences on health . Compared to other men , gay and bisexual men have a higher chance of having depression and anxiety disorders . MSM blood and tissue donor controversy Many countries impose restrictions on donating blood for men who have or have had sex with men , as well as their female sexual partners . Similar restrictions in many countries also prohibit donation of tissues such as corneas by men who have sex with men , often with far longer deferral periods than for MSM blood donors . Most national standards require direct questioning regarding a donor \\'s sexual history , but the length of deferral varies .

His name in Vedic Sanskrit connotes \" impeller , rouser , vivifier . \" He is sometimes identified with—and at other times distinguished from—Surya , \" the Sun god \" . When considered distinct from the Sun proper , he is conceived of as the divine influence or vivifying power of the Sun . The Sun before sunrise is called Savitr , and after sunrise until sunset it is called Sūrya . Savitr is venerated in the Rig Veda , the oldest component of the Vedic scriptures . He is first recorded in book three of the Rigveda ; ( RV 3.62.10 ) later called the Gayatri mantra . Furthermore , he is described with great detail in Hymn 35 of the Rig Veda , also called the Hymn of Savitr . In this hymn , Savitr is personified and represented as a patron deity . He is celebrated in eleven whole hymns of the Rig Veda and in parts of many others texts , with his name being mentioned about 170 times in aggregate . Savitr disappeared as an independent deity from the Hindu pantheon after the end of the Vedic period , but is still worshiped in modern Hinduism and is referred to as Sāvitrī . Rigvedic deity Savitr is a deity whose name primarily denotes an agent , in the form of a noun derived from a verbal root with the agent suffix -tṛ added . The name of Savitr belongs to a class of Vedic theonyms , together with Dhatṛ , Tratṛ and Tvastr . These names denote that these are agent gods , who create , protect , and produce , respectively . Appearance Savitr has golden arms , and is broad-handed or beautiful-handed . He is also pleasant tongued or beautiful-tongued , and is once called iron-jawed . His eyes are golden as well . He is yellow-haired , an attribute shared with Agni and Indra . He dons on a tawny garb . He has a golden chariot with a golden axle , which is omni-form , just as he himself is capable of assuming all forms . His channel is analogized as a resplendent chariot drawn by two radiant steeds or by two or more bronze , white-footed stallions . Mighty splendour ( \" amati \" ) is preeminently attributed to Savitr , and mighty \" golden \" splendour to him only . Such splendour he stretches out or diffuses . He illumines the air , heaven and earth , the world , the spaces of the earth , the vault of heaven . Functions Like Pushan and Surya , he is lord of that which is mobile and is stationary . Savitr has been attributed to as upholding the movables and immovable , which signifies the maintenance of Ṛta . Savitr is a beneficent god who acts as protector of all beings , who are provident and guard the world of spirits . Being an Aditya , Savitr is true to the Eternal Order and act as the score exacter . His primordial pathways in the air are dustless and sleekly traversed , on them he is besought to fortify his invokers . He is prayed to convey the departed soul to where the righteous dwell . Savitr bestows immortality on the gods as well as length of life on man . He also bestowed immortality on the Rbhus , who by the greatness of their deeds advanced to his dwelling . Like other gods , Savitr is a supporter of the cosmos . Also , he holds the whole world , a role which was also assigned to Vishnu in the Vedas . Abstract classification There are two classes of deities in the Rig Veda whose nature is founded on abstraction . The first class , consisting of the direct personifications of abstract notions – such as \\'desire \\' – is rare , occurring only in the very latest hymns of the Rig Veda and due to that growth of speculation which is so plainly traceable in the course of the Vedic age . The second and more numerous class comprises deities whose names primarily either denote an agent , in the form of a noun derived from a root with the suffix \" -tṛ \" ( such as Dhatr , \\'Creator \\' ) or designate some attribute , such as Prajapati ( \\'Lord of Creatures \\' ) . The class , judged by the evolution of the mythological creations of the Veda , does not represent direct abstractions , but appears in each case to be derived from an epithet applied to one or more deities , illustrating a particular aspect of activity or character . Such epithets gradually become detached , finally attaining an independent status . Thus Rohita , the \\'Red One \\' ( whose female form is Rohinī ) , originally an epithet of the sun , as a separate deity in the capacity of a Creator . Savitr is never mentioned as having part in the Soma sacrifice Solar aspects According to Yaska , Sanskrit scholar of the 5th century BCE , who made various attempts to interpret difficult Vedic mythologies in his work Nirukta ( Etymology ) ( 12 , 12 ) , the time of Savitr ’ s appearance is when darkness has been removed . Sayanacharya ( on Rig Veda ) remarks that before his rising the sun is called Savitr , but from his rising to his setting , Surya . But Savitr is also sometimes spoken of as \" sending to sleep \" , and must therefore be connected with evening as well as morning . He is , indeed , extolled as the setting sun in one hymn ( 2 , 38 ) ; and there are indications that most of the hymns addressed to him are meant for either a morning or an evening sacrifice . He brings all two-footed and four-footed beings to rest and awakens them . He unyokes his steeds , brings the wanderer to rest ; at his command night comes ; the weaver rolls up her web and the skilful man lays down his unfinished work . Later the west was wont to be assigned to him , as the east to Agni , and the south to Soma . The epithet \" sūrya-raśmi \" is used in the Rig Veda only once , and it is applied to Savitr : \" Radiating with the beams of the Sun , golden-haired , Savitr raises up His effulgence continually from the east . \" Like Surya , Savitr is implored to remove evil nightmares and to render men sinless . Savitr drives away sorcerers and antagonism . He observes fixed laws . The waters and the wind are subject to his ordinance . He leads the waters and by his propulsion they flow broadly . The other gods follow his lead . No being , not even Indra , Varuna , Mitra , Aryaman , Rudra , can resist his will and independent dominion . His praises are celebrated by the Vasus , Aditi , Varuna , Mitra and Aryaman . He is lord of all things worthy , and bestows blessings pervading heaven , air , earth . ... the connection of Savitr with the sun is fairly close . It is at least possible , therefore , that in its origin Savitr was not an independent creation , but was an epithet of Surya , but that question is of little importance : The essential feature of the god is not his original basis , but his function as the inspirer or impeller to holy sacrifice : The ritual act is repeatedly said in the Yajur Veda to be done ‘ on the instigation of the god Savitr ’ . In several passages of the Rig Veda , Savitr and Surya appear simultaneously . It may even appear based on A.B . Keith \\'s opinion that the terms Savitar and Surya are used interchangeably in certain hymns of the Rig Veda . However it is worth noting that several other deities are directly associated with the epithet of Savitar in the Family Books . They include Indra who is paired alongside Savitar , and Tvastr who is compounded with Savitar . Furthermore , Savitar is unambiguously identified with Bhaga . Savitar is also unambiguously called Pusan and Mitra . While Savitar certainly has directly been charged with using Surya \\'s rays , Savitar has a much more direct congruence with other deities . The Vedic poet observes : \" [ G ] od Savitr has raised aloft his brilliance , making light for the whole world ; Surya shining brightly has filled heaven and earth and air with his rays . \" In another hymn Surya is spoken of in terms Prasavitṛ ( Vivifier ) , an adjective usually applied to Savitr , and in the third verse Savitr is apparently mentioned as the same god as Surya . In other hymns also , it is hardly possible to separate the two deities . In certain passages , Savitr combines with the rays of the sun or shines with the rays of the sun . Savitr has a major role in creation . The relevant hymn mentions that : \" Indra measured six broad spaces , from which no existing thing is excluded : He it is who made the wide expanse of earth and the lofty dome of the sky , even he . \" Savitr assisted Indra in shaping the universe . [ T ] here are in the last book of the Rig Veda some hymns which treat the origin of the world philosophically rather than mythologically . Various passages show that in the cosmological speculation of the Rig Veda The sun was regarded as an important agent of generation . Thus he is called the soul ( atma ) of all that moves and stands . Statements such as that he is called by many names though one indicate that his nature was being tentatively abstracted to that of a supreme god , nearly approaching that of the later conception of Brahma . In this sense the sun is once glorified as a great power of the universe under the name of the golden embryo , hiranya-garbha , in Rig Veda . It is he who measures out space in the air and shines where the sun rises . In the last verse of this hymn , he is called Prajapati , lord of created beings , the name which became that of the chief god of the Brahmanas . It is significant that in the only older passage of the Rig veda in which it occurs , Prajapati is an epithet of the solar deity Savitr , who in the same hymn is said to rule over what moves and stands . Other names and epithets Apam napat ( Born of the Waters ) Savitr is at least once . called \" apam napat \" ( Child of Waters ) , an epithet applied to Agni and Soma as well . God of the Middle Region Commentator Yaska commenting on the verse where Savitr is attributed with causing rain , regards Savitr as belonging to the mesial region ( or atmosphere ) for possessing this ability , adding that the Adityas , who are in heaven , are also called Savitr . It is probably owing to this epithet and because Savitr ’ s paths are said to be in the atmosphere , that this deity occurs among the gods of the mesial expanse among those of outer space in the Naighantuka . Prajapati Savitr is once depicted as the Prajapati of the world . In the Satapatha Brahmana ( v . 12 , 3 , 5 ) , Savitr has been identified with Prajapati and in the Taittiriya Brahmana ( v . 1 , 6 , 4 ) , it has been stated that Prajapati becoming Savitr created living beings . Damunas ( Domestic ) In the Rig Veda , Savitr has been twice spoken of as domestic ( \" damunas \" ) , an epithet otherwise almost entirely limited to Agni . Asura Like many other gods , Savitr is mentioned as ‘ asura ’ in many hymns of the Rig Veda . Pusan Savitr alone is the lord of vivifying power and on account of his movements ( yamabhih ) , he becomes Pusan . In two consecutive verses , Pusan and Savitr are described as connected . In the first the favour of Pusan who sees all beings is invoked , and in the second , Savitr is besought to stimulate the thoughts of worshipers who desire to think of the excellent brilliance of the Deva . The latter verse is the celebrated Savitri , now termed as the Gayatri mantra , with which Savitr was in later times invoked at the beginning of Vedic study . Mitra Savitr is also said to become Mitra by reason of his laws . Bhaga Savitr seems sometimes to be identified with Bhaga also , unless the latter word is here only an epithet of Savitr . The name of Bhaga , the good god bestowing benefits is indeed often added to that of Savitr so as to form the single expression Savitr Bhaga or Bhaga Savitr , with the term Bhaga simply acting as a qualitative and attributive adjective . Savitr in the Brahmanas The Vedas do not specifically identify the Ādityas as there is no classification of the thirty-three gods , except for in the Yajurveda ( 7.19 ) , which says that there are eleven gods in heaven ( light space ) , eleven gods in the atmosphere ( intermediate space ) , and eleven gods on earth ( observer space ) . In some passages of the Satapatha Brahmana , the number of Ādityas is eight , and in other passages twelve Ādityas are mentioned . Savitr disappears in post-Vedic literature and is absent from the corpus of Pauranic Hinduism . Hindu revivalism Some modern Hindu spiritual thinkers assign symbolism to the Vedic deities like Savitr . The Vedic deities are not only forces of nature , but also forces that exist within the human intellect and psyche , and help the individual in spiritual progress . According to Sri Aurobindo , the Vedic depictions are deeper than mere imagery . The gods , goddesses and the evil forces mentioned in the Vedas represent various cosmic powers . They play a significant role in the drama of creation , preservation , and destruction in the inner world of a human being . Once the senses are controlled and the mind is stabilized through slaying of all the dark powers , comes the awakening , the goddess Ushas , who brings along with her Ashvins into the world of inner consciousness . After Ushas appears Aditi , the Primal Sun , the God of Light : First as Savitr , who represents the divine grace essential for all spiritual success , and then as Mitra , who as the divine love is considered as a friend of the illumined mind ( Indra ) and his associates ( the other gods ) . The Sun is of Truth , after which appear Rta ( Truth in Action ) and Rtachit ( Truth consciousness ) . Popular culture In DC Comics \\' The Flash comics and The CW \\'s The Flash TV series , the speedster Savitar is an enemy of the Flash who named himself after the Hindu god . In a fiction by author Ryan Sequeira , called \" EvOLv \" , where Savitr has been named as one of the Supreme Gods - parallel with Shiva - The God Savitr is referred to as the source of light in the multiverse . In the Dark-Hunter fantasy series by author Sherrilyn Kenyon , Savitar is a Chthonian god killer who is thousands of years old and was responsible for policing the Atlantean pantheon .

The protection is intended to reduce bystanders \\' hesitation to assist , for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or wrongful death . An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada : a good Samaritan doctrine is a legal principle that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing . Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment . By contrast , a duty to rescue law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable . Good Samaritan laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction , as do their interactions with various other legal principles , such as consent , parental rights and the right to refuse treatment . Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals \\' or career emergency responders \\' on-the-job conduct , but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity . The principles contained in good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is English common law , such as Australia . In many countries that use civil law as the foundation for their legal systems , the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of duty to rescue . Good Samaritan laws take their name from a parable found in the Bible , attributed to Jesus , commonly referred to as the Parable of the Good Samaritan which is contained in Luke 10:29–37 . It recounts the aid given by a traveller from the area known as Samaria to another traveller of a conflicting religious and ethnic background who had been beaten and robbed by bandits . Regions Good Samaritan laws tend to differ by region , as each is crafted based on local interpretations of the providers protected , as well as the scope of care covered . Australia Most Australian states and territories have some form of good Samaritan protection . In general , these offer protection if care is made in good faith , and the \" good Samaritan \" is not impaired by drugs or alcohol . Variations exist between states , from not applying if the \" good Samaritan \" is the cause of the problem ( New South Wales ) , to applying under all circumstances if the attempt is made in good faith ( Victoria ) . Belgium The Belgian Good Samaritan Law imposes on anyone who is capable to aid a legal duty to help a person , who is in great danger , without putting himself or others in serious danger ( article 422bis Criminal Code ) . Canada In Canada , good Samaritan acts fall under provincial jurisdiction . Each province has its own act , such as Ontario \\'s and British Columbia \\'s respective Good Samaritan Acts , Alberta \\'s Emergency Medical Aid Act , and Nova Scotia \\'s Volunteer Services Act . Only in Quebec , a civil law jurisdiction , does a person have a general duty to respond , as detailed in the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms . An example of a typical Canadian law is provided here , from Ontario \\'s Good Samaritan Act , 2001 , section 2 : Protection from liability 2 . ( 1 ) Despite the rules of common law , a person described in subsection ( 2 ) who voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward provides the services described in that subsection is not liable for damages that result from the person \\'s negligence in acting or failing to act while providing the services , unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person . 2001 , c . 2 , s . 2 ( 1 ) . Yukon and Nunavut do not have good Samaritan laws . China There have been incidents in China , such as the Peng Yu incident in 2006 , where good Samaritans who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves . The death of Wang Yue was caused when the toddler was run over by two vehicles . The entire incident was caught on a video , which shows eighteen people seeing the child but refusing to help . In a November 2011 survey , a majority , 71 % , thought that the people who passed the child without helping were afraid of getting into trouble themselves . According to China Daily , \" at least 10 Party and government departments and organizations in Guangdong , including the province \\'s commission on politics and law , the women \\'s federation , the Academy of Social Sciences , and the Communist Youth League , have started discussions on punishing those who refuse to help people who clearly need it . \" Officials of Guangdong province , along with many lawyers and social workers , also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of Guangzhou to discuss the case . It was reported that various lawmakers of the province are drafting a good Samaritan law , which would \" penalize people who fail to help in a situation of this type and indemnify them from lawsuits if their efforts are in vain \" . Legal experts and the public are debating the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push . On 1 August 2013 , the nation \\'s first good Samaritan law went into effect in Shenzhen . On 1 October 2017 , China \\'s national Good Samaritan law came into force , Clause 184 in Civil Law General Principles . Finland The Finnish Rescue Act explicitly stipulates a duty to rescue as a \" general duty to act \" and \" engage in rescue activities according to [ one \\'s ] abilities \" . The Finnish Rescue Act thus includes a principle of proportionality which requires professionals to extend immediate aid further than laypersons . The Finnish Criminal Code stipulates : Germany In Germany , failure to provide first aid to a person in need is punishable under § 323c of its criminal penal code . However , any help one provides can not and will not be prosecuted even if it made the situation worse or did not fulfill specific first aid criteria . People are thus encouraged to help in any way possible , even if the attempt is not successful . Moreover , people providing first aid are covered by the German Statutory Accident Insurance in case they suffer injury , losses , or damages . India There were around 480,000 road accidents in India in 2016 , out of which 150,000 were killed . The Good Samaritan law gives legal protection to the good samaritans in Karnataka who help accidents victims with emergency medical care within the \\'Golden Hour \\' . People are thus encouraged to help in any way possible , even if the attempt is not successful . Ireland The Civil Law ( Miscellaneous Provisions ) Act of 2011 first introduced legislation specifically addressing the liability of citizen good Samaritans or volunteers in the Republic of Ireland , without introducing a duty to intervene . This act provides for exemption from liability for a person , or voluntary organization , for anything done while providing \" assistance , advice or care \" to a person who is injured , in serious risk or danger of becoming injured or suffering from an illness ( or apparently so ) . There are exclusions for cases of \" bad faith \" or \" gross negligence \" on behalf of the carer , and incidents relating to the negligent use of motor vehicles . This Act only addresses situations where there is no duty of care owed by the good Samaritan or the volunteer . The pre-hospital emergency care council ( PHECC ) specifically addresses the good Samaritan section of the Civil Law Act of 2011 and states that \" The use of skills and medications restricted to Registered Practitioners would be covered under the \\'Good Samaritan \\' Act . This Act assumes that you had no intention to practice during this time and that you acted as a Good Samaritan , assisting until the Emergency Services arrive on scene and you can hand over . \" Israel In Israel , the law requires anyone to assist a person in danger or at the very least call for help . People who help in good faith are not liable for damages . Helpers are eligible for compensation for damages caused to them during their assistance . Romania In Romania , the health reform passed in 2006 states that persons without medical training offering basic first aid voluntarily at the indications of a medical dispatch office or from own knowledge of first aid maneuvers , acting in good will to preserve the life or health of another person can not be held responsible under penal or civil law . United Kingdom In the common law of England and Wales there is no criminal liability for failing to act in the event of another person being in danger ; however , there are exceptions to this rule . In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander , a dangerous situation was created by them , or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act , criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action . The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue . The Social Action , Responsibility and Heroism Act 2015 helps protect \\'good Samaritans \\' when considering a claim of negligence or a breach of duty . United States All 50 states and the District of Columbia have some type of Good Samaritan law . The details of good Samaritan laws/acts vary by jurisdiction , including who is protected from liability and under what circumstances . The 1998 Aviation Medical Assistance Act also provided coverage for \" Good Samaritans \" while in flight ( Section 5b ) . Common features Good Samaritan laws often sharing different combinations or interpretations of the similar features , which vary by region . Duty to assist In some jurisdictions , unless a caretaker relationship ( such as a parent-child or doctor-patient relationship ) exists prior to the illness or injury , or the \" good Samaritan \" is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury , no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim . Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota , Vermont and Rhode Island do require a person at the scene of an emergency to provide reasonable assistance to a person in need . This assistance may be to call 9-1-1 . Violation of the duty-to-assist subdivision is a petty misdemeanour in Minnesota and may warrant a fine of up to $ 100 in Vermont . At least five other states , including California and Nevada , have seriously considered adding duty-to-assist subdivisions to their good Samaritan statutes . New York \\'s law provides immunity for those who assist in an emergency . The public policy behind the law is : Imminent peril Good Samaritan provisions are not universal in application . The legal principle of imminent peril may also apply . In the absence of imminent peril , the actions of a rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection . To illustrate , a motor vehicle collision occurs , but there is no fire , no immediate life threat from injuries , and no danger of a second collision . If someone , with good intentions , causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage , a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless . Reward or compensation Only first aid provided without the intention of reward or financial compensation is covered . Medical professionals are typically not protected by good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment . Some states make specific provisions for trained medical professionals acting as volunteers and for members of volunteer rescue squads acting without expectation of remuneration . In Texas , a physician who voluntarily assisted in the delivery of an infant , and who proved that he had \" no expectation of remuneration \" , had no liability for the infant \\'s injuries due to allegedly ordinary negligence ; there was \" uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor any doctor in Travis County would have charged a fee to [ the mother ] or any other person under the circumstances of this case \" . It was significant that the doctor was not an employee of the attending physician , but was only visiting the hospital and had responded to a \" Dr . Stork \" page , and had not asked or expected to be paid . Obligation to remain If a responder begins rendering aid , he must not leave the scene until it is necessary to call for needed medical assistance , a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over , or continuing to give aid is unsafe . This can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases , such as vinyl , latex , or nitrile gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens . A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person . The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted , as long as the responder acted rationally , in good faith , and in accordance with their level of training . Consent The responder must obtain the consent of the patient , or of the legal guardian of a patient who is a minor , unless this is not possible ; failing to do so may attract a charge of assault or battery . Implied consent Consent may be implied if an unattended patient is unconscious , delusional , intoxicated , or deemed mentally unfit to make decisions regarding his or her safety , or if the responder has a reasonable belief that this was so ; courts tend to be very forgiving in adjudicating this , under the legal fiction that \" peril invites rescue \" ( as in the rescue doctrine ) . The test in most jurisdictions is that of the \" average , reasonable person \" . To illustrate , would the average , reasonable person in any of the states described above consent to receiving assistance in these circumstances is able to make a decision ? Consent may also be implied if the legal parent or guardian is not immediately reachable and the patient is not considered an adult . Parental consent If the victim is a minor , consent must come from a parent or guardian . However , if the legal parent or guardian is absent , unconscious , delusional , or intoxicated , consent is implied . A responder is not required to withhold life-saving treatment ( e.g. , CPR or the Heimlich maneuver ) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent . The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting the minor , and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed . Special circumstances may exist if child abuse is suspected ( the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect , similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse , such as teachers or counsellors ) . Laws for first responders only In some jurisdictions , good Samaritan laws only protect those who have completed basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations , such as the American Heart Association , or American Red Cross , provided that they have acted within the scope of their training . In these jurisdictions , a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified , and who performs first aid incorrectly , can be held legally liable for errors made . In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally . In Florida , paramedics , EMTs , and Emergency Medical Responders ( First Responders ) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law , which requires them to stop and give aid that falls within their practice . Comparison with duty to rescue Good Samaritan laws may be confused with the duty to rescue , as described above . U.S . and Canadian approaches to this issue differ . Under the common law , good Samaritan laws provide a defence against torts arising from the attempted rescue . Such laws do not constitute a duty to rescue , such as exists in some civil law countries , and in the common law under certain circumstances . However , the duty to rescue where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability ; for example , under the German law of unterlassene Hilfeleistung ( an offense not to provide first aid when necessary ) , a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful . In Canada , all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of English Common Law . Quebec operates a civil law system , based in part on the Napoleonic Code , and the principle of duty to rescue does apply . Similarly , in France anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts ( civil and criminal liability ) . The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine ( under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code ) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims . To illustrate a variation in the concept of duty to rescue , in the Canadian province of Ontario , the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work . There are , however , specific exceptions to this right . When the \" life , health or safety of another person is at risk \" , then specific groups , including \" police officers , firefighters , or employees of a hospital , clinic or other type of medical worker ( including EMS ) \" are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work .

See also Greek mythology Roman mythology Similarities between Roman , Greek , and Etruscan mythologies References Hercules : The Legendary Journeys Hercules and Xena characters Hercules Fictional Greek people', 'Twenty Years After ( ) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas , first serialized from January to August 1845 . A book of The d\\'Artagnan Romances , it is a sequel to The Three Musketeers ( 1844 ) and precedes the 1847–1850 novel The Vicomte de Bragelonne ( which includes the sub-plot Man in the Iron Mask ) . The novel follows events in France during the Fronde , during the childhood reign of Louis XIV , and in England near the end of the English Civil War , leading up to the victory of Oliver Cromwell and the execution of King Charles I . Through the words of the main characters , particularly Athos , Dumas comes out on the side of the monarchy in general , or at least the text often praises the idea of benevolent royalty . His musketeers are valiant and just in their efforts to protect young Louis XIV and the doomed Charles I from their attackers . Synopsis D\\'Artagnan and Mazarin The action begins during the regency of Queen Anne of Austria ( term 1643–1651 ) , with Cardinal Mazarin as First Minister . D\\'Artagnan , who seemed to have a promising career ahead of him at the end of The Three Musketeers , has for twenty years remained a lieutenant , and seems unlikely to progress despite his ambition and the debt the queen owes him . He is summoned by Mazarin , who requires an escort ; the French people detest Mazarin , and are on the brink of rebellion ( La Fronde ) . D\\'Artagnan is sent to the Bastille to retrieve a prisoner , who turns out to be his former adversary , the Comte de Rochefort . After renewing his acquaintance with d\\'Artagnan and making a promise to aid his advancement , Rochefort is brought to his audience with Mazarin , where he learns that the cause for his imprisonment was his refusal to serve Mazarin at an earlier stage . He does , however , remember his promise , and though he offers his own service to Mazarin , he refuses to watch over the Duc de Beaufort , who is imprisoned at the time , and soon learns that , in consequence , he is to be returned to the Bastille , though this does not deter him from speaking highly of the achievements of d\\'Artagnan and the Three Musketeers . Having determined that d\\'Artagnan is the man he seeks , Mazarin enters the chambers of the Queen to let her know that he has enlisted the man who had served her so well twenty years earlier . The Queen , feeling guilty for having forgotten d\\'Artagnan \\'s service , gives Mazarin a diamond ring to return to d\\'Artagnan , one which she had previously given him that d\\'Artagnan sold . The avaricious Mazarin merely uses the diamond to show d\\'Artagnan that he is once again to enter the Queen \\'s service . He commissions d\\'Artagnan to go in search of his friends . Reunion of the Four Musketeers D\\'Artagnan is at a loss ; he has completely lost touch with his friends , who have resumed their real names . Athos , the Comte de la Fère , had returned to his estate near Blois ; Porthos , Monsieur du Vallon , had married a lawyer \\'s widow ; and Aramis became a priest , the Abbé d\\'Herblay . Fortune intervenes when Planchet , his old servant , enters d\\'Artagnan \\'s chambers , attempting to escape arrest for aiding the escape of Rochefort . Through Planchet , he locates Bazin , Aramis \\' old servant , now beadle at Notre Dame . Though Bazin is unwilling to help , d\\'Artagnan is able to find out , through an altar boy , that Bazin makes frequent visits to Noisy . D\\'Artagnan and Planchet go there , where they are set upon by a group who think them Frondeurs while outside the house of Madame de Longueville . When this group is satisfied that d\\'Artagnan is not the man they seek , Aramis surprises Planchet by dropping onto his horse from the tree in which he had been hiding . D\\'Artagnan finds that the former musketeer , who had thought of little other than being a priest , is now a priest who thinks of little other than being a soldier . Aramis is not willing to enter into Mazarin \\'s service , however . D\\'Artagnan leaves but waits in hiding , suspecting that Aramis is both the Frondeur who had been sought earlier and the lover of Madame de Longueville . His suspicions are confirmed . The visit to Aramis was not fruitless , as it yielded the address of Porthos . When d\\'Artagnan arrives at Porthos \\' estate he finds Mousqueton , who is overjoyed to meet d\\'Artagnan and Planchet . He finds that Porthos , despite his wealth and life spent in pursuit of amusement , is not happy . Porthos desires to become a baron , and with this bait d\\'Artagnan lures him into Mazarin \\'s service . D\\'Artagnan then continues his search for Athos , whom he finds almost completely changed , to be an example to his ward , Raoul . Though Athos will not be enlisted into Mazarin \\'s service , and indeed reveals that his sympathies lie against Mazarin , the two arrange to meet again in Paris ; Athos wishes to bring Raoul there to help him to become a gentleman , and also to separate him from Louise de la Vallière , with whom Raoul is obsessively in love . In Paris , Athos visits Madame de Chevreuse , the former mistress of Aramis , with whom , under the name Marie Michon , Aramis had much communication in The Three Musketeers . Athos reveals , discreetly , that Raoul is the son born of a chance encounter that Athos had with her , and through her gets a letter of recommendation for Raoul to join the army . The Duc de Beaufort The scene then changes , to focus on the Duc de Beaufort , Mazarin \\'s prisoner at Vincennes , who finds a new jailer , Athos \\' servant , the silent Grimaud . Grimaud instantly makes himself disagreeable to the Duc , as part of an escape plot . Using messages passed to Rochefort using tennis balls , they arrange to have a meal on Whitsuntide , to which La Ramée , second in command of the prison , is invited . The escape is successful , but d\\'Artagnan and Porthos are in pursuit . After a race against time , and having defeated several adversaries along the way , Porthos and d\\'Artagnan find themselves in the dark , surrounded , with swords crossed against adversaries equal to them , who are revealed to be Athos and Aramis . The four arrange to meet in Paris at the Place Royale ; both parties , now finding themselves enemies , enter fearing a duel , but they reconcile and renew their vows of friendship . Enter Mordaunt As this is going on , Raoul is travelling to join the army . Along the road he sees a gentleman of around the same age , and tries to make haste to join him . The other gentleman reaches the ferry before him , but has fallen into the river . Raoul , who is used to fording rivers , saves the gentleman , the Comte de Guiche , and the two become friends . Further along the road , the debt is repaid when the Comte saves Raoul when they are attacked by Spanish soldiers . After the fight , they find a man close to death who requests the last rites . They help him to a nearby inn and find a traveling monk . This monk is unpleasant to them and does not seem inclined to perform this service , so they force him to go to the inn . Once there , the monk hears the confession . The dying man reveals that he was the executioner of Béthune and confesses his part in the execution of Milady de Winter . The monk reveals himself as her son , John Francis de Winter , who calls himself Mordaunt after Charles I stripped him of all his titles . Mordaunt stabs the executioner . Grimaud , who is to join Raoul , comes upon the inn just as this is taking place , though too late to prevent it , or to detain the monk . After hearing what happened from the dying man , making his excuses to Raoul , he departs to warn Athos about the son of Milady . After his departure , Raoul and Guiche are forced to retreat when the Spanish come upon the town . After joining the army of the Prince de Condé , Raoul provides assistance in interrogating the prisoner brought by Guiche and him , when the prisoner feigns to misunderstand them in several languages . Once they have learned the location of the Spanish army , they set out for battle , Raoul accompanying the Prince . Meanwhile , d´Artagnan and Porthos help Queen Anne of Austria , the young Louis XIV and Mazarin escape Paris after its citizens finally start a rebellion by using children \\'s slings ( frondes ) to hurl stones at the windows of Mazarin \\'s associates . The champion of the French populace and parliament , Pierre Broussel , is arrested , but then released when it becomes clear that his imprisonment has only served to stir the crowd up worse . D´Artagnan meets the young king and watches over him as some Frondeurs - including Planchet , under a false name - who wanted to make sure that the king and queen were not about to escape , enter the king \\'s bedroom demanding to see him . Immediately after this , he contrives for all of the royal household to escape from Paris anyway , bluffing his way past Planchet at the gates ( the two men retain their friendship despite their differing allegiances in this conflict ) . After that , Mazarin sends d\\'Artagnan and Porthos to England with a message for Cromwell and orders them to stay there for some time under Cromwell \\'s command . At the same time , Queen Henrietta of England meets the Musketeers \\' old English friend , Lord de Winter - a Royalist come to ask for French assistance for King Charles I of England , her husband , in the English Civil War and sends Athos and Aramis to England as well . So once again the two pairs of Musketeers find themselves on opposite sides : but Athos and Aramis , on the occasion of departing , are recognised by Mordaunt , who has been following Lord de Winter in the hope of finding his friends . In England Milady \\'s son , Mordaunt , now twenty-three , sets about avenging his mother \\'s death . He seeks not only Lord de Winter , but the other four unknown conspirators who took part in his mother \\'s clandestine \" trial \" and execution . He murders his uncle , Lord de Winter , who was Milady \\'s brother-in-law , during the same battle in which King Charles I is captured . Athos and Aramis are captured by d\\'Artagnan and Porthos who are fighting alongside Mordaunt and Cromwell \\'s troops . As soon as they can have a conversation , Athos talks d\\'Artagnan and Porthos into helping save Charles I . D\\'Artagnan and Porthos free their friends and start making plans in order to try to save the king . In the end , all their plans fail and Mordaunt turns to regicide , executing King Charles I after d\\'Artagnan and the three former Musketeers have kidnapped the real executioner in order to prevent this . D\\'Artagnan and his friends later confront Mordaunt at Cromwell \\'s London residence , but in the course of a duel with d\\'Artagnan he escapes through a secret passage . The Frenchmen and their servants leave England by ship , but Mordaunt gets aboard and blows it up . Unfortunately for him , the Musketeers \\' servants had earlier discovered the explosives on board , roused their masters , and contrived to steal the only lifeboat before the ship can blow up , leaving Mordaunt aboard . Mordaunt escapes the blast , and pleads with the Musketeers to let him into their boat . With the exception of Athos , they contemptuously reject his appeals . Athos insists on saving him , but as he helps him into the boat , Mordaunt deliberately drags him under the water where they struggle and Mordaunt is killed . Athos rejoins the others , stating : \" I had a son . I wanted to live . \" This seems to confirm what d\\'Artagnan has long suspected , that the reason Athos \\'s ward , Raoul de Bragelonne whom he adopted after he was abandoned by his mother , bears such a resemblance to him is because he is Athos \\'s natural son . Athos further states that \" It was not me who killed him . It was fate . \" Finale Once back in France , the four friends go separate ways . D\\'Artagnan and Porthos head to Paris through a different route from Athos and Aramis , knowing that Mazarin will not forgive their disobedience . Aramis and Athos reach Paris only to find out that their friends have not . After looking for D\\'Artagnan and Porthos , they learn the duo has been imprisoned by Mazarin in Rueil . Athos tries to persuade Queen Anne to free his friends , but is imprisoned as well . After this , d\\'Artagnan manages to escape with Porthos and capture Mazarin . Mazarin is taken to one of Porthos \\'s castles and he makes some concessions to the four friends in exchange for his freedom . These include making Porthos a baron and making d\\'Artagnan a captain of Musketeers . Athos asks for nothing : Aramis asks for concessions towards himself and his friends in the Fronde . These concessions are later accepted by Queen Anne , who finally realizes she has been rather ungrateful to d\\'Artagnan and his friends . At the end of the novel , the first Fronde comes to an end and Mazarin , Queen Anne , and Louis XIV enter Paris . A riot takes place during which d\\'Artagnan accidentally kills Rochefort and Porthos kills Bonacieux ( who in the earlier novel was d\\'Artagnan \\'s landlord and an agent of Richelieu and is now a beggar and Frondist ) . At the end the four friends once again go their separate ways . D\\'Artagnan stays in Paris with Mazarin and Queen Anne ; Athos returns to la Fère ; Aramis returns to his abbey in Noisy le Sec ; and Porthos returns to his castle to enjoy his baronage .

P . Putnam \\'s Sons , featuring a reporter named Jim Qwilleran and his Siamese cats , Kao K \\' o-Kung ( Koko for short ) and Yum Yum . The first was written in 1966 , with two more following in 1967 and 1968 . The fourth appeared eighteen years later , after which at least one new novel was published every year until 2007 . A thirtieth novel , originally announced for 2008 , was postponed indefinitely by its publisher and then canceled after the author \\'s death in 2011 . It remains unpublished . Main characters James Mackintosh Qwilleran Qwilleran , or Qwill as his friends call him , is the main human character in the books . He was born Merlin James Qwilleran , a fact explained by his mother ( in a letter to Francesca Klingenschoen ) as a product of reading King Arthur during her pregnancy . His father , Dana , was a talented theater actor who toured the country . When he met Qwill \\'s mother , Anne Mackintosh , they chose to stay in Chicago , so he could not stay in his theater group . Qwill \\'s grandparents strongly disapproved of this relationship , and broke off all contact with his mother ; Dana , deprived of work opportunities because of the economic depression , fell into evil ways and was eventually shot dead while attempting burglary . Because of this , Qwill never knew any family other than his mother . But he does remember his mother \\'s friend Francesca Klingenschoen , known to Qwilleran as Aunt Fanny . He grew up with Arch Riker , who would be his lifelong friend , and with a love of literature . He was very smart at school , won many spelling bees and was always very fond of language and baseball . One of his English teachers was particularly influential , cultivating his ability to compose an interesting essay on any topic . When he was seventeen , his girlfriend , Joy Wheatley ( she later returns in The Cat Who Saw Red ) left to \" find herself \" and Qwill joined the service . It is never explicitly stated which war he fought in , but it is likely that he served during Operation Torch during World War II , since several times throughout the series he uses a curse he learned while in North Africa . He came out of it with an injured knee and so could not have the career in baseball he always desired . So he went to college , participated in some acting , but found it was journalism for which he had a natural knack . In this light he decided to become a journalist , and encountered great success in this field . He primarily reported on crime for major newspapers , and even wrote a book , City of Brotherly Crime ( a best-seller ) , and won many awards . He then married Miriam , an advertising executive who resembled Joy . But the marriage was bad and ended in a shattering divorce that left Miriam in an insane asylum and Qwill feeling depressed and guilty . This led him to become an alcoholic and lose his job . One night while drunk , he fell into the path of a subway train and was rescued just in time . This brought him back to reality and he got help . After resolving never to touch alcohol again , he was virtually broke . Qwill went to \" the city \" ( no name is given , but it is most likely in the Great Lakes area , probably Detroit based on Lilian \\'s residence and its 2 newspapers that are delivered throughout the state ) to get a job at The Daily Fluxion . The books continue the story from this point . One summer , he and his cats go for a quiet retreat , vacationing in the north woods , and visit Aunt Fanny on the way . Soon after , Aunt Fanny dies , and Qwill is surprised to learn that her will leaves the vast Klingenschoen fortune to him—provided he lives in Moose County for the next 5 years . So Qwilleran moves to Moose County ( \" 400 miles north of everywhere \" ) in the northern part of the state , and the next few books record this adjustment—for him , and his cats . Despite the initial culture shock of small-town life , Qwilleran makes friends and , after determining that being a billionaire is a nuisance , establishes the Klingenschoen Foundation , a philanthropic organization dedicated to improving life in Moose County and surrounds . After a while , his life settles into a yearly pattern . He spends springs and autumns at the four-story apple barn he \\'d had converted into a residence ; he spends summers at a cabin on the shore of one of the Great Lakes ; and he spends his winters in a condo development , as the barn is impractical to live in during the winter , being four stories of open interior space and therefore impossible to heat evenly . Characteristics Qwilleran ( Qwill to his friends ) is a man who goes from late forties to mid fifties over the course of the series . He \\'s six feet , two inches tall , with dark brooding eyes and salt-and-pepper hair ( he can still claim that it \\'s mostly pepper ) . He is slightly overweight in the early books , but loses some weight over the course of the series . He is often described as looking melancholy or brooding , but he is witty and enjoyable company . His most distinguishing feature is his \" luxuriant moustache , \" which is considered attractive by many women , and Polly Duncan describes it as being similar to the composer Edward MacDowell ’ s . ( Elsewhere it is compared to those of Mark Twain - who is alleged to have visited Moose County in 1895 - and Charles Rennie Mackintosh . ) However , his moustache is more than mere facial hair . Whenever Qwilleran gets a suspicion that something is wrong or his instincts are right , he will get \" a tingling sensation on his upper lip . \" Depending upon the strength of the sensation , he may be seen \" stroking it with his fingertips \" to \" pounding [ his mustache ] with his knuckles \" . Qwilleran has a willingness to listen , which is described as part curiosity and part professional interest . He also has a strong desire to investigate things that are not his business and could endanger him , and these investigations make up the plot of the various books . He gets on well with most people , but generally prefers to avoid children . Although he is a former alcoholic , he appears to have his condition well in hand , to the point that he can keep alcohol at home to serve to the people he entertains . Due to the disastrous nature of his former marriage , he has no inclination to remarry , despite his strong feelings for Polly Duncan . Despite his immense inherited fortune , he is far from extravagant , and uses the vast majority of his money for philanthropy or civic projects . Koko \" Kao K ’ o-Kung \" is the full name of the Siamese cat who is almost always referred to as Koko . He is named after a 13th-century Chinese artist of the same name , also known as Gao Kegong , and was formerly owned by Fluxion art critic George Bonifield Mountclemens III , who was highly fond of cats . Mountclemens claimed that the cat \" ... himself has the dignity and grace of Chinese art . \" He fed Koko a gourmet diet of lobster , chicken and many other high-class meals . Koko will not accept normal cat food , leaving Qwilleran to provide for his expensive diet . He has the appearance of a prize-winning show-cat and an obstinate attitude toward anything he does not like . He often goes out of his way to annoy or embarrass female humans he does not approve of . He also has a habit of watching birds and knocking books off shelves , and these books are normally read to the cats by Qwilleran . Though it would seem he would be able to do fine on his own , when Qwill had to go to work , Koko became lonely and this led to Qwill to get Yum Yum . Of course , because Koko eats food like salmon and crab , Yum Yum had the privilege of eating this food as well . Qwilleran always feeds them such meals throughout the series . Characteristics Koko \\'s most notable characteristic is his sixth sense . On the surface , his actions are not that extraordinary ; they are things that any energetic and healthy cat might do from time to time . He might dig up small pieces of evidence , for instance , or point something out to Qwilleran by acting extremely attracted to it . He has also been known to use seemingly random yowls or body language to communicate things , especially when a death is caused by foul play : he has both a \" death howl \" and a unique \" death dance \" . Sometimes Qwilleran does not immediately recognize the significance of Koko \\'s actions , and sometimes will not recognize them at all ( if they occur before Qwill has the slightest idea of any misdemeanor ) , at least not until the case has been solved . He also seems to have the power to trigger certain important events , such as causing a blackout by sitting in the middle of a pyramid . During the several occasions in which Qwill \\'s life has been threatened , Koko has come to his aid and been instrumental in the defeat of Qwill \\'s assailant . Koko \\'s action made him famous among members of The Press Club in the city , where he received an official membership signed by the Chief of Police . Qwilleran believes Koko has his unusually strong sixth sense because he has 30 whiskers on each side of his face ( 60 in total ) , while most cats have 24 ( 48 in total ) . Whiskers are significant in the stories because , as mentioned earlier , Qwill often has a tingling sensation in his moustache when he is on the right train of thought when a case is involved , and a moustache can be called \" whiskers . \" Yum Yum Yum Yum does not appear to have any extraordinary abilities , so she does not play as active a role in solving the mysteries , but is still a major character in the series . She is also Siamese , and had a troubled past . Her history is fully explained in The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern , but it can be summed up rather briefly . Qwilleran got Yum Yum as a kitten from the Taits , rich folk who did not treat Yum Yum properly and did not even truly decide on her name . Mr . Tait , a jade collector , named her Yu after a variety of jade , while Mrs . Tait , whose family originates from Aarhus , Denmark calls her Freya , after the Norse goddess of love . Qwilleran adopted her partially because he could not stand her circumstances ( explained in The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern ) and partially because , after consulting an expert , Qwilleran realized Koko needed someone to keep him company . Yum Yum is named after a character in the opera The Mikado by Gilbert and Sullivan who is also the ward of a man named Ko-Ko . Characteristics Yum Yum is described as being smaller than Koko , and far more affectionate . Her beautiful violet-blue eyes are slightly crossed . She has a lot of dexterity , being able to open drawers , operate switches , and so forth , and likes to pilfer small objects . These traits have earned her the nickname \" Yum Yum The Paw . \" Qwilleran ’ s relationship with his cats Qwilleran has a very strong attachment to Koko and Yum Yum . Qwilleran is not affected by matters that could threaten his own life , but becomes extremely anxious when matters involve the cats . During the several occasions where they had gone missing , he has risked his own life to save them , and he does not know what he would do without them . He often thinks that his old acquaintances would never believe he could love his cats as he does , and can hardly believe it himself sometimes . There is , however , no question that Qwilleran has an extremely strong bond with his cats .

Major characters The following are major characters from the novel . Protagonists Dagny Taggart Dagny Taggart is the protagonist of the novel . She is vice-president in Charge of Operations for Taggart Transcontinental , under her brother , James Taggart . Given James \\' incompetence , Dagny is responsible for all the workings of the railroad . Francisco d\\'Anconia Francisco d\\'Anconia is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged , an owner by inheritance of the world \\'s largest copper mining operation . He is a childhood friend , and the first love , of Dagny Taggart . A child prodigy of exceptional talents , Francisco was dubbed the \" climax \" of the d\\'Anconia line , an already prestigious family of skilled industrialists . He was a classmate of John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld and student of both Hugh Akston and Robert Stadler . He began working while still in school , proving that he could have made a fortune without the aid of his family \\'s wealth and power . Later , Francisco bankrupts the d\\'Anconia business to put it out of others \\' reach . His full name is given as \" Francisco Domingo Carlos Andres Sebastián d\\'Anconia \" . John Galt John Galt is the primary male hero of Atlas Shrugged . He initially appears as an unnamed menial worker for Taggart Transcontinental , who often dines with Eddie Willers in the employees \\' cafeteria , and leads Eddie to reveal important information about Dagny Taggart and Taggart Transcontinental . Only Eddie \\'s side of their conversations is given in the novel . Later in the novel , the reader discovers this worker \\'s true identity . Before working for Taggart Transcontinental , Galt worked as an engineer for the Twentieth Century Motor Company , where he secretly invented a generator of usable electric energy from ambient static electricity , but abandoned his prototype , and his employment , when dissatisfied by an easily corrupted novel system of payment . This prototype was found by Dagny Taggart and Hank Rearden . Galt himself remains concealed throughout much of the novel , working a job and living by himself , where he unites the most skillful inventors and business leaders under his leadership . Much of the book \\'s third division is given to his broadcast speech , which presents the author \\'s philosophy of Objectivism . Henry \" Hank \" Rearden Henry ( known as \" Hank \" ) Rearden is one of the central characters in Atlas Shrugged . He owns the most important steel company in the United States , and invents Rearden Metal , an alloy stronger , lighter , cheaper and tougher than steel . He lives in Philadelphia with his wife Lillian , his brother Philip , and his elderly mother . Rearden represents a type of self-made man and eventually divorces Lillian , abandons his steel mills following a bloody assault by government-planted workers , and joins John Galt \\'s strike . Eddie Willers Edwin \" Eddie \" Willers is the Special Assistant to the Vice-President in Charge of Operations at Taggart Transcontinental . His father and grandfather worked for the Taggarts , and himself likewise . He is completely loyal to Dagny and to Taggart Transcontinental . Willers does not possess the creative ability of Galt \\'s associates , but matches them in moral courage and is capable of appreciating and making use of their creations . After Dagny shifts her attention and loyalty to saving the captive Galt , Willers maintains the railroad until its collapse . Ragnar Danneskjöld One of Galt \\'s first followers , and world-famous as a pirate , who seizes relief ships sent from the United States to the People \\'s States of Europe . He works to ensure that once those espousing Galt \\'s philosophy are restored to their rightful place in society , they have enough capital to rebuild the world . Kept in the background for much of the book , Danneskjöld makes a personal appearance to encourage Rearden to persevere in his increasingly difficult situation , and gives him a bar of gold as compensation for the income taxes he has paid over the last several years . Danneskjöld is married to the actress Kay Ludlow ; their relationship is kept hidden from the outside world , which only knows of Ludlow as a retired film star . Considered a misfit by Galt \\'s other adherents , he views his actions as a means to speed the world along in understanding Galt \\'s perspective . According to Barbara Branden , who was closely associated with Rand at the time the book was written , there were sections written describing Danneskjöld \\'s adventures at sea , cut from the final published text . In a 1974 comment at a lecture , Ayn Rand admitted that Danneskjöld \\'s name was a tribute to Victor Hugo \\'s novel , , wherein the hero becomes the first of the Counts of Danneskjöld . In the published book , Danneskjöld is always seen through the eyes of others ( Dagny Taggart or Hank Rearden ) , except for a brief paragraph in the very last chapter . Antagonists James Taggart The President of Taggart Transcontinental and the book \\'s most important antagonist . Taggart is an expert influence peddler but incapable of making operational decisions on his own . He relies on his sister , Dagny Taggart , to actually run the railroad , but nonetheless opposes her in almost every endeavor because of his various anti-capitalist moral and political beliefs . In a sense , he is the antithesis of Dagny . This contradiction leads to the recurring absurdity of his life : the desire to overcome those on whom his life depends , and the horror that he will succeed at this . In the final chapters of the novel , he suffers a complete mental breakdown upon realizing that he can no longer deceive himself in this respect . Lillian Rearden The unsupportive wife of Hank Rearden , who dislikes his habits and ( secretly at first ) seeks to ruin Rearden to prove her own value . Lillian achieves this , when she passes information to James Taggart about her husband \\'s affair with his sister . This information is used to blackmail Rearden to sign a Gift Certificate which delivers all the property rights of Rearden Metal to others . Lillian thereafter uses James Taggart for sexual satisfaction , until Hank abandons her . Dr . Floyd Ferris Ferris is a biologist who works as \" co-ordinator \" at the State Science Institute . He uses his position there to deride reason and productive achievement , and publishes a book entitled Why Do You Think You Think ? He clashes on several occasions with Hank Rearden , and twice attempts to blackmail Rearden into giving up Rearden Metal . He is also one of the group of looters who tries to get Rearden to agree to the Steel Unification Plan . Ferris hosts the demonstration of the Project X weapon , and is the creator of the Ferris Persuader , a torture machine . When John Galt is captured by the looters , Ferris uses the device on Galt , but it breaks down before extracting the information Ferris wants from Galt . Ferris represents the group which uses brute force on the heroes to achieve the ends of the looters . Dr . Robert Stadler A former professor at Patrick Henry University , and along with colleague Hugh Akston , mentor to Francisco d\\'Anconia , John Galt and Ragnar Danneskjöld . He has since become a sell-out , one who had great promise but squandered it for social approval , to the detriment of the free . He works at the State Science Institute where all his inventions are perverted for use by the military , including a sound-based weapon known as Project X ( Xylophone ) . He is killed when Cuffy Meigs ( see below ) drunkenly overloads the circuits of Project X , causing it to destroy itself and every structure and living thing in a 100-mile radius . The character was , in part , modeled on J . Robert Oppenheimer , whom Rand had interviewed for an earlier project , and his part in the creation of nuclear weapons. ` To his former student Galt , Stadler represents the epitome of human evil , as the \" man who knew better \" but chose not to act for the good . Wesley Mouch The incompetent and treacherous lobbyist whom Hank Rearden reluctantly employs in Washington , who rises to prominence and authority throughout the novel through trading favours and disloyalty . In return for betraying Hank by helping broker the Equalization of Opportunity Bill ( which , by restricting the number of businesses each person may own to one , forces Hank to divest most of his companies ) , he is given a senior position at the Bureau of Economic Planning and National Resources . Later in the novel he becomes its Top Co-ordinator , a position that eventually becomes Economic Dictator of the country . Mouch \\'s mantra , whenever a problem arises from his prior policy , is to say , \" I ca n\\'t help it . I need wider powers . \" Secondary characters The following secondary characters also appear in the novel . Hugh Akston is identified as \" One of the last great advocates of reason . \" He was a renowned philosopher and the head of the Department of Philosophy at Patrick Henry University , where he taught Francisco d\\'Anconia , John Galt , and Ragnar Danneskjöld . He was , along with Robert Stadler , a father figure to these three . Akston \\'s name is so hallowed that a young lady , on hearing that Francisco had studied under him , is shocked . She thought he must have been one of those great names from an earlier century . He now works as a cook in a roadside diner , and proves extremely skillful at the job . When Dagny tracks him down , and before she discovers his true identity , he rejects her enthusiastic offer to manage the dining car services for Taggart Transcontinental . He is based on Aristotle . Jeff Allen is a tramp who stows away on a Taggart train during one of Dagny \\'s cross-country trips . Instead of throwing him out , she allows him to ride as her guest . It is from Allen that she learns the full story behind the collapse of the Twentieth Century Motor Company ( Rand \\'s extensive metaphor for the inherent flaws of communism ) , as well as a hint of John Galt \\'s true background . Calvin Atwood is owner of Atwood Light and Power Company and joins Galt \\'s strike . Mayor Bascom is the mayor of Rome , Wisconsin , who reveals part of the history of the Twentieth Century Motor Company . Dr . Blodgett is the scientist who pulls the lever to demonstrate Project X . Orren Boyle is the head of Associated Steel , antithesis of Hank Rearden and a friend of James Taggart . He is an investor in the San Sebastián Mines .

Footnotes Notes Citations General references External links Website with comprehensive list of individuals mentioned in Atlas Shrugged Fictional socialites Lists of literary characters Literary characters introduced in 1957', 'Bleak House is a novel by Charles Dickens , first published as a 20-episode serial between March 1852 and September 1853 . The novel has many characters and several sub-plots , and is told partly by the novel \\'s heroine , Esther Summerson , and partly by an omniscient narrator . At the centre of Bleak House is a long-running legal case in the Court of Chancery , Jarndyce and Jarndyce , which comes about because a testator has written several conflicting wills . In a preface to the 1853 first edition , Dickens claimed there were many actual precedents for his fictional case . One such was probably the Thellusson v Woodford case in which a will read in 1797 was contested and not determined until 1859 . Though many in the legal profession criticised Dickens \\'s satire as exaggerated , this novel helped support a judicial reform movement which culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s . There is some debate among scholars as to when Bleak House is set . The English legal historian Sir William Holdsworth sets the action in 1827 ; however , reference to preparation for the building of a railway in Chapter LV suggests the 1830s . Synopsis Jarndyce and Jarndyce is an interminable law case in the Court of Chancery , concerning two or more wills and the beneficiaries of them . Sir Leicester Dedlock and his wife Honoria live on his estate at Chesney Wold . Lady Dedlock is a beneficiary under one of the wills . While listening to the reading by the family solicitor , Mr Tulkinghorn , of an affidavit , she recognises the handwriting on the copy . The sight affects her so much she almost faints , which Mr Tulkinghorn notices and investigates . He traces the copyist , a pauper known only as \" Nemo \" , in London . Nemo has recently died , and the only person to identify him is a street-sweeper , a poor homeless boy named Jo , who lives in a particularly grim and poverty-stricken part of the city known as Tom-All-Alone \\'s ( \" Nemo \" is Latin for \" nobody \" ) . Esther Summerson is raised by the harsh Miss Barbary , who tells her \" Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers \" . After Miss Barbary dies , John Jarndyce becomes Esther \\'s guardian and assigns the Chancery lawyer \" Conversation \" Kenge to take charge of her future . After attending school for six years , Esther moves in with him at his home , Bleak House . Jarndyce simultaneously assumes custody of two other wards , Richard Carstone and Ada Clare ( who are both his and one another \\'s distant cousins ) . They are beneficiaries in one of the wills at issue in Jarndyce and Jarndyce ; their guardian is a beneficiary under another will , and the two wills conflict . Richard and Ada soon fall in love , but though Mr Jarndyce does not oppose the match , he stipulates that Richard must first choose a profession . Richard first tries a career in medicine , and Esther meets Allan Woodcourt , a physician , at the house of Richard \\'s tutor . When Richard mentions the prospect of gaining from the resolution of Jarndyce and Jarndyce , John Jarndyce beseeches him never to put faith in what he calls \" the family curse \" . Richard decides to change his career to law . He later switches again and spends the remainder of his funds to buy a commission as a military officer . Lady Dedlock is also investigating the copyist , disguised as her maid , Mademoiselle Hortense . Lady Dedlock pays Jo to take her to Nemo \\'s grave . Meanwhile , Mr Tulkinghorn is concerned Lady Dedlock has a secret which could threaten the interests of Sir Leicester and he watches her constantly , even enlisting her maid to spy on her . He also enlists Inspector Bucket to run Jo out of town , to eliminate anything that might connect Nemo to the Dedlocks . Esther sees Lady Dedlock at church and talks with her later at Chesney Wold . Lady Dedlock discovers that Esther is her own child : unknown to Sir Leicester , before she married Honoria had a lover , Captain Hawdon ( Nemo ) , and had a daughter by him who she had believed was dead . The daughter , Esther , was brought up by Honoria \\'s sister , Miss Barbary . Esther becomes sick ( possibly with smallpox , since it severely disfigures her ) from the homeless boy Jo . Lady Dedlock waits until Esther has recovered before telling her the truth . Though Esther and Lady Dedlock are happy to be reunited , Lady Dedlock tells Esther they must never acknowledge their connection again . Upon her recovery , Esther finds that Richard , having failed at several professions , has ignored his guardian \\'s advice and is trying to push Jarndyce and Jarndyce to conclusion in his and Ada \\'s favour , and has fallen out with John Jarndyce . In the process , Richard loses all his money and declines in health . He and Ada have secretly married , and Ada is pregnant . Esther has her own romance when Mr Woodcourt returns to England , having survived a shipwreck , and he continues to seek her company despite her disfigurement . However , Esther has already agreed to marry her guardian , the much older John Jarndyce . Mademoiselle Hortense and Mr Tulkinghorn discover the truth about Lady Dedlock \\'s past . After a confrontation with Mr Tulkinghorn , Lady Dedlock flees her home , leaving a note apologising to Sir Leicester for her conduct . Mr Tulkinghorn dismisses Hortense , who is no longer of any use to him . Mr Tulkinghorn is shot through the heart , and suspicion falls on Lady Dedlock . Sir Leicester , discovering his lawyer \\'s death and his wife \\'s confession and flight , suffers a catastrophic stroke , but he manages to communicate that he forgives his wife and wants her to return . Inspector Bucket , who has previously investigated several matters related to Jarndyce and Jarndyce , accepts Sir Leicester \\'s commission to find Lady Dedlock . At first he suspects Lady Dedlock of the murder but is able to clear her of suspicion after discovering Hortense \\'s guilt . He requests Esther \\'s help to find her mother . Lady Dedlock has no way to know of her husband \\'s forgiveness or that she has been cleared of suspicion , and she wanders the country in cold weather before dying at the cemetery of her former lover , Captain Hawdon ( Nemo ) . Esther and Inspector Bucket find her there . Progress in Jarndyce and Jarndyce seems to take a turn for the better when a later will is found , which revokes all previous wills and leaves the bulk of the estate to Richard and Ada . John Jarndyce cancels his engagement to Esther , who becomes engaged to Mr Woodcourt . They go to Chancery to find Richard . On their arrival , they learn that the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally over , because the costs of litigation have entirely consumed the estate . Richard collapses , and Mr Woodcourt diagnoses him as being in the last stages of tuberculosis . Richard apologises to John Jarndyce and dies . John Jarndyce takes in Ada and her child , a boy whom she names Richard . Esther and Mr Woodcourt marry and live in a Yorkshire house which Jarndyce gives to them . The couple later raise two daughters . Many of the novel \\'s subplots focus on minor characters . One such subplot is the hard life and happy , though difficult , marriage of Caddy Jellyby and Prince Turveydrop . Another plot focuses on George Rouncewell \\'s rediscovery of his family , and his reunion with his mother and brother . Characters As usual , Dickens drew upon many real people and places but imaginatively transformed them in his novel ( see character list below for the supposed inspiration of individual characters ) . Although not a character , the Jarndyce and Jarndyce case is a vital part of the novel . It is believed to have been inspired by a number of real-life Chancery cases involving wills , including those of Charles Day and William Jennens , and of Charlotte Smith \\'s father-in-law , Richard Smith . Major characters Esther Summerson is the heroine . She is Dickens \\'s only female narrator . Esther is raised as an orphan by Miss Barbary ( who is in fact her aunt ) . She does not know her parents \\' identity . Miss Barbary holds macabre vigils on Esther \\'s birthday each year , telling her that her birth is no cause for celebration , because the girl is her mother \\'s \" disgrace . \" Because of her cruel upbringing she is self-effacing , self-deprecating and grateful for every trifle . The discovery of her true identity provides much of the drama in the book . Finally it is revealed that she is the illegitimate daughter of Lady Dedlock and Nemo ( Captain Hawdon ) . Honoria , Lady Dedlock is the haughty mistress of Chesney Wold . The revelation of her past drives much of the plot . Before her marriage , Lady Dedlock had an affair with another man and bore his child . Lady Dedlock discovers the child \\'s identity ( Esther Summerson ) , and because she has revealed that she had a secret predating her marriage , she has attracted the curiosity of Mr Tulkinghorn , who feels bound by his ties to his client , Sir Leicester , to pry out her secret . At the end of the novel , Lady Dedlock dies , disgraced in her own mind and convinced that her husband can never forgive her moral failings . John Jarndyce is an unwilling party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , guardian of Richard , Ada , and Esther , and owner of Bleak House . Vladimir Nabokov called him \" one of the best and kindest human beings ever described in a novel \" . A wealthy man , he helps most of the other characters , motivated by a combination of goodness and guilt at the mischief and human misery caused by Jarndyce and Jarndyce , which he calls \" the family curse . \" At first , it seems possible that he is Esther \\'s father , but he disavows this shortly after she comes to live under his roof . He falls in love with Esther and wishes to marry her , but gives her up because she is in love with Mr Woodcourt . Richard Carstone is a ward of Chancery in Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Straightforward and likeable but irresponsible and inconstant , Richard falls under the spell of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . At the end of the book , just after Jarndyce and Jarndyce is finally settled , he dies , tormented by his imprudence in trusting to the outcome of a Chancery suit . Ada Clare is another young ward of Chancery in Jarndyce and Jarndyce . She falls in love with Richard Carstone , a distant cousin . They later marry in secret and she has Richard \\'s child . Harold Skimpole is a friend of Jarndyce \" in the habit of sponging his friends \" ( Nuttall ) . He is irresponsible , selfish , amoral , and without remorse . He often refers to himself as \" a child \" and claims not to understand human relationships , circumstances , and society – but actually understands them very well , as he demonstrates when he enlists Richard and Esther to pay off the bailiff who has arrested him on a writ of debt . He believes that Richard and Ada will be able to acquire credit based on their expectations in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and declares his intention to start \" honouring \" them by letting them pay some of his debts . This character is commonly regarded as a portrait of Leigh Hunt . \" Dickens wrote in a letter of 25 September 1853 , \\' I suppose he is the most exact portrait that was ever painted in words ! ... It is an absolute reproduction of a real man . \\' A contemporary critic commented , \\' I recognised Skimpole instantaneously ; ... and so did every person whom I talked with about it who had ever had Leigh Hunt \\'s acquaintance . \\' \" G . K . Chesterton suggested that Dickens \" may never once have had the unfriendly thought , \\'Suppose Hunt behaved like a rascal ! \\' ; he may have only had the fanciful thought , \\'Suppose a rascal behaved like Hunt ! \\' \" . Lawrence Boythorn is an old friend of John Jarndyce \\'s ; a former soldier who always speaks in superlatives ; very loud and harsh , but goodhearted . Boythorn was once engaged to ( and very much in love with ) a woman who later left him without giving him any reason . That woman was in fact , Miss Barbary , who abandoned her former life ( including Boythorn ) when she took Esther from her sister . Boythorn is also a neighbour of Sir Leicester Dedlock \\'s , with whom he is engaged in an epic tangle of lawsuits over a right-of-way across Boythorn \\'s property that Sir Leicester asserts the legal right to close . He is thought to be based on the writer Walter Savage Landor . Sir Leicester Dedlock is a crusty baronet , very much older than his wife . Dedlock is an unthinking conservative who regards the Jarndyce and Jarndyce lawsuit as a mark of distinction worthy of a man of his family lineage . On the other hand , he is shown as a loving and devoted husband towards Lady Dedlock , even after he learns about her secret . Mr Bill Tulkinghorn is Sir Leicester \\'s lawyer . He defers to his clients but enjoys the power his control of their secrets gives him . He learns of Lady Dedlock \\'s past and tries to control her conduct , to preserve the reputation and good name of Sir Leicester . He is murdered , and his murder gives Dickens the chance to weave a detective plot into the closing chapters of the book . Mr Wallace Snagsby is the timid and hen-pecked proprietor of a law-stationery business who gets involved with Mr Tulkinghorn and Inspector Bucket \\'s secrets . He is Jo \\'s only friend . He tends to give half-crowns to those he feels sorry for . Miss Annie Flite is an elderly eccentric . Her family has been destroyed by a long-running Chancery case similar to Jarndyce and Jarndyce , and her obsessive fascination with Chancery veers between comedy and tragedy . She owns a large number of little birds which she says will be released \" on the day of judgement . \" Mr ( William ) Guppy is a law clerk at Kenge and Carboy . He becomes smitten with Esther and makes an offer of marriage ( which she refuses ) . Later , after Esther learns that Lady Dedlock is her mother , she asks to meet Mr Guppy to tell him to stop investigating her past . He fears the meeting is to accept his offer of marriage ( which he does not want to pursue now that she is disfigured ) . He is so overcome with relief when she explains her true purpose that he agrees to do everything in his power to protect her privacy in the future . Inspector Bucket of the Detective ( Branch ) is a Metropolitan Police detective who undertakes several investigations throughout the novel , most notably the investigation of the murder of Mr Tulkinghorn . He is notable in being one of the first detectives in English fiction . This character is probably based on Inspector Charles Frederick Field of the then recently formed Detective Branch at Scotland Yard . Dickens wrote several journalistic pieces about the Inspector and the work of the detectives in Household Words . It has also been argued that the character was based on Jack Whicher , one of the \\'original \\' eight detectives set up by Scotland Yard in the middle 19th century . Mr George is a former soldier ( having served under Nemo ) who owns a London shooting-gallery and is a trainer in sword and pistol . The prime suspect in the murder of Mr Tulkinghorn , he is exonerated and his true identity is revealed , against his wishes . He is George Rouncewell , son of the Dedlocks \\' housekeeper , Mrs Rouncewell , who welcomes him back to Chesney Wold . He ends the book as body-servant to the stricken Sir Leicester Dedlock . Caddy ( Caroline ) Jellyby is a friend of Esther \\'s , secretary to her mother . Caddy feels ashamed of her own \" lack of manners \" , but Esther \\'s friendship heartens her . Caddy falls in love with Prince Turveydrop , marries him , and has a baby . Krook is a rag and bottle merchant and collector of papers . He is the landlord of the house where Nemo and Miss Flite live and where Nemo dies . He seems to subsist on a diet of gin . Krook dies from a case of spontaneous combustion , something that Dickens believed could happen , but which some critics ( such as the English essayist George Henry Lewes ) denounced as outlandish . Amongst the stacks of papers obsessively hoarded by the illiterate Krook is the key to resolving the case of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . Jo is a young boy who lives on the streets and tries to make a living as a crossing sweeper . Jo was the only person with whom Nemo had any real connection . Nemo expressed a paternal sort of interest in Jo ( something that no human had ever done ) . Nemo would share his meagre money with Jo , and would sometimes remark , \" Well , Jo , today I am as poor as you , \" when he had nothing to share . Jo is called to testify at the inquiry into Nemo \\'s death , but knows nothing of value . Despite this , Mr Tulkinghorn pays Inspector Bucket to harry Jo and force him to keep \" moving along \" [ leave town ] because Mr Tulkinghorn fears Jo might have some knowledge of the connection between Nemo and the Dedlocks . Jo ultimately dies from a disease ( pneumonia , a complication from an earlier bout with smallpox which Esther also catches and from which she almost dies ) . Allan Woodcourt is a surgeon and a kind , caring man who loves Esther deeply . She in turn loves him but feels unable to respond , not only because of her prior commitment to John Jarndyce , but also because she fears her illegitimacy will cause his mother to object to their connection . Grandfather ( Joshua ) Smallweed is a moneylender , a mean , bad-tempered man who shows no mercy to people who owe him money and who enjoys inflicting emotional pain on others . He lays claim to the deceased Krook \\'s possessions because Smallweed \\'s wife is Krook \\'s only living relation , and he also drives Mr George into bankruptcy by calling in debts .

Analysis and criticism Narrative structure Much criticism of Bleak House focuses on its unique narrative structure : it is told both by a third-person omniscient narrator and a first-person narrator ( Esther Summerson ) . The omniscient narrator speaks in the present tense and is a dispassionate observer . Esther Summerson tells her own story in the past tense ( like David in David Copperfield or Pip in Great Expectations ) , and her narrative voice is characterised by modesty , consciousness of her own limits , and willingness to disclose to us her own thoughts and feelings . These two narrative strands never quite intersect , though they do run in parallel . Nabokov felt that letting Esther tell part of the story was Dickens \\'s \" main mistake \" in planning the novel . Alex Zwerdling , a scholar from Berkeley , after observing that \" critics have not been kind to Esther \" , nevertheless thought Dickens \\'s use of Esther \\'s narrative \" one of the triumphs of his art \" . Feminine modesty Esther \\'s portion of the narrative is an interesting case study of the Victorian ideal of feminine modesty . She introduces herself thus : \" I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages , for I know I am not clever \" ( chap . 3 ) . This claim is almost immediately belied by the astute moral judgement and satiric observation that characterise her pages . In the same introductory chapter , she writes : \" It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself ! As if this narrative were the narrative of life ! But my little body will soon fall into the background now \" ( chap . 3 ) . This does not turn out to be true . Satire For most readers and scholars , the central concern of Bleak House is its indictment of the English Chancery court system . Chancery or equity courts were one half of the English civil justice system , existing side-by-side with law courts . Chancery courts heard actions having to do with wills and estates , or with the uses of private property . By the mid-nineteenth century , English law reformers had long criticised the delays of Chancery litigation , and Dickens found the subject a tempting target . He already had taken a shot at law-courts and that side of the legal profession in his 1837 novel The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club or The Pickwick Papers . Scholars , such as the English legal historian Sir William Searle Holdsworth , in his 1928 series of lectures , have made a plausible case for treating Dickens \\'s novels , and Bleak House in particular , as primary sources illuminating the history of English law . Spontaneous combustion Dickens claimed in the preface to the book edition of Bleak House that he had \" purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things \" . And some remarkable things do happen : One character , Krook , smells of brimstone and eventually dies of spontaneous human combustion . This was highly controversial . The nineteenth century saw the increasing triumph of the scientific worldview . Scientifically inclined writers , as well as doctors and scientists , rejected spontaneous human combustion as legend or superstition . When the instalment of Bleak House containing Krook \\'s demise appeared , the literary critic George Henry Lewes accused Dickens of \" giving currency to a vulgar error \" . Dickens vigorously defended the reality of spontaneous human combustion and cited many documented cases , as well as his own memories of coroners \\' inquests that he had attended when he had been a reporter . In the preface of the book edition of Bleak House , Dickens wrote : \" I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable Spontaneous Combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received . \" Critical reputation George Gissing and G . K . Chesterton are among those literary critics and writers who consider Bleak House to be the best novel that Charles Dickens wrote . As Chesterton put it : \" Bleak House is not certainly Dickens \\'s best book ; but perhaps it is his best novel \" . Harold Bloom , in his book The Western Canon , considers Bleak House to be Dickens \\'s greatest novel . Daniel Burt , in his book The Novel 100 : A Ranking of the Greatest Novels of All Time , ranks Bleak House number 12 . Horror and supernatural fiction author Stephen King named it among his top 10 favourite books . Locations of Bleak House The house named Bleak House in Broadstairs is not the original . Dickens stayed with his family at this house ( then called Fort House ) for at least one month every summer from 1839 until 1851 . However , there is no evidence that it formed the basis of the fictional Bleak House , particularly as it is so far from the location of the fictional house . The house is on top of the cliff on Fort Road and was renamed Bleak House after his death , in his honour . It is the only four storey grade II listed mansion in Broadstairs . Dickens locates the fictional Bleak House in St Albans , Hertfordshire , where he wrote some of the book . An 18th-century house in Folly Lane , St Albans , has been identified as a possible inspiration for the titular house in the story since the time of the book \\'s publication and was known as Bleak House for many years . Adaptations In the late nineteenth century , actress Fanny Janauschek acted in a stage version of Bleak House in which she played both Lady Dedlock and her maid Hortense . The two characters never appear on stage at the same time . In 1876 John Pringle Burnett \\'s play , Jo found success in London with his wife , Jennie Lee playing Jo , the crossing-sweeper . In 1893 , Jane Coombs ( actress ) acted in a version of Bleak House . A 1901 short film , The Death of Poor Joe , is the oldest known surviving film featuring a Charles Dickens character ( Jo in Bleak House ) . In the silent film era , Bleak House was filmed in 1920 and 1922 . The latter version featured Sybil Thorndike as Lady Dedlock . In 1928 , a short film made in the UK in the Phonofilm sound-on-film process starred Bransby Williams as Grandfather Smallweed . In 1998 , BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation of five hour-long episodes , starring Michael Kitchen as John Jarndyce . The BBC has produced three television adaptations of Bleak House . The first serial , Bleak House , was broadcast in 1959 in eleven half-hour episodes . The serial survives . The second Bleak House , starring Diana Rigg and Denholm Elliott , aired in 1985 as an eight-part series . In 2005 , the third Bleak House was broadcast in fifteen episodes starring Anna Maxwell Martin , Gillian Anderson , Denis Lawson , Charles Dance , and Carey Mulligan . It won a Peabody Award that same year because it \" created \\'appointment viewing , \\' soap-style , for a series that greatly rewarded its many extra viewers . \" Musical references Charles Jefferys wrote the words for and Charles William Glover wrote the music for songs called Ada Clare and Farewell to the Old House , which are inspired by the novel . Anthony Phillips included a piece entitled \" Bleak House \" on his 1979 progressive rock release , Sides . The form of the lyrics roughly follows the narrative of Esther Summerson , and is written in her voice . Original publication Like most Dickens novels , Bleak House was published in 20 monthly instalments , each containing 32 pages of text and two illustrations by Phiz ( the last two being published together as a double issue ) . Each cost one shilling , except for the final double issue , which cost two shillings . Critical editions Charles Dickens , Bleak House , ed .

Notes and references External links Official website Bout d\\'Brousse music festival Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Vaud', 'An asylum seeker is a person who leaves their country of residence , enters another country and applies for asylum ( i.e. , international protection ) in this other country . An asylum seeker is an immigrant who has been forcibly displaced and might have fled their home country because of war or other factors harming them or their family . If their case is accepted , they become considered a refugee . The terms asylum seeker and refugee are often confused . A person becomes an asylum seeker by making a formal application for the right to remain in another country and keeps that status until the application has been concluded . The relevant immigration authorities of the country of asylum determine whether the asylum seeker will be granted protection and become an officially recognized refugee or whether asylum will be refused and the asylum seeker becomes an illegal immigrant who may be asked to leave the country and may even be deported . In North American English , the term asylee is also used . An asylee can either be an asylum seeker , as defined above , or a person whose claim for asylum was accepted and asylum was granted . On average , about 1 million people apply for asylum every year . The asylum seeker may be recognised as a refugee and given refugee status if their circumstances fall into the definition of refugee according to the 1951 Refugee Convention or other refugee laws—such as the European Convention on Human Rights , if asylum is claimed within the European Union . However , signatories to the refugee convention create their own policies for assessing the protection status of asylum seekers , and the proportion of asylum applicants who are accepted or rejected varies each year from country to country . Types of asylum and protection Asylum as an institution is not restricted to the category of individuals who qualify for refugee status . On the contrary , this institution predates the birth of the international regime for the protection of refugees . Asylum seekers who have committed crimes against peace , a war crime or a crime against humanity , or other serious non-political crimes , or whose actions are contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations , are excluded from international protection . Convention refugee status As of 1 July 2013 , there were 145 parties to the 1951 Refugee Convention and 146 to the 1967 Protocol . These states are bound by an obligation under international law to grant asylum to people who fall within the definition of Convention and Protocol . The refugee definitions of 1951 and 1967 are the strictest and most exclusive and persons who fall within this definition are called Convention refugees and their status is called Convention refugee status . Persons who do not fall within this definition may still be granted complementary forms of protection , if they fall within other refugee definitions . The practical determination of whether a person is a refugee or not is most often left to certain government agencies within the host country . In some countries the refugee status determination ( RSD ) is done by the UNHCR . The burden of substantiating an asylum claim lies with the claimant , who must establish that they qualify for protection . In many countries , country-of-origin information is used by migration officials as part of the assessment of asylum claims , and governments commission research into the accuracy of their country reports . Some countries have studied the rejection rates of their migration officials making decisions , finding that individuals reject more applicants than others assessing similar cases—and migration officials are required to standardise the reasons for accepting or rejecting claims , so that the decision of one adjudicator is consistent with what their colleagues decide . The refugee definition of the 1951 Convention is universally binding , but there are many other definitions according to which protection may be offered to people who do not fall within this definition . Subsidiary protection status Subsidiary protection is an international protection for persons seeking asylum who do not qualify as refugees . It is an option to get asylum for those who do not have a well-founded fear of persecution ( which is required for refugee status according to the 1951 Convention ) , but do indeed have a substantial risk to be subjected to torture or to a serious harm if they are returned to their country of origin , for reasons that include war , violence , conflict and massive violations of human rights . The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and European Union law have a broader definition of who is entitled to asylum . Temporary protection visa Temporary protection visas are used to persons in Australia who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival . It is the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities and they are required to reapply for it every three years . Statistics of asylum decisions Status determination processes Group determination Asylum seekers may be given refugee status on a group basis . Refugees who went thought the group status determination are also referred to as prima facie refugees . This is done in situations when the reasons for seeking refugee status are generally well known and individual assessment would otherwise overwhelm the capacities of assessors . Group determination is more readily done in states that not only have accepted the refugee definition of the 1951 Convention , but also use a refugee definition that includes people fleeing indiscriminate or generalized violence , which are not covered in the 1951 Convention . Individual assessment For persons who do not come into the country as part of a bigger group individual asylum interviews are conducted to establish whether the person has sufficient reasons for seeking asylum . Appeals In many countries , asylum applicants can challenge a rejection by challenging the decision in a court or migration review panel . In the United Kingdom , more than one in four decisions to refuse an asylum seeker protection are overturned by immigration judges . Rights of asylum seekers Whilst waiting for a decision asylum seekers have limited rights in the country of asylum . In most countries they are not allowed to work and in some countries not even to volunteer . In some countries they are not allowed to move freely within the country . Even access to health care is limited . In the European Union , those who have yet to be granted official status as refugees and are still within the asylum process have some restricted rights to healthcare access . This includes access to medical and psychological care . However , these may vary depending on the host country . For instance , under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act ( Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz ) in Germany , asylum seekers are outside primary care and are limited to emergency health care , vaccinations , pregnancy and childbirth with limitations on specialty care . Asylum seekers have greater chance of experiencing unmet health needs as compared to the general German population . Asylum seekers also have greater odds of hospital admissions and at least one visit to a psychotherapists relative to the German general population . Issues Research suggests cross-sector collaboration is key to assist refugees and asylum seekers resettle and integrate into receiving communities , workplaces and schools . Non-governmental organizations concerned with refugees and asylum seekers have pointed out difficulties for displaced persons to seek asylum in industrialized countries . As the immigration policy in many countries often focuses on the fight of illegal immigration and the strengthening of border controls , it deters displaced persons from entering territory in which they could lodge an asylum claim . The lack of opportunities to legally access the asylum procedures can force displaced persons to undertake often expensive and hazardous attempts at illegal entry . In recent years , the public as well as policy makers of many countries are focussing more and more on refugees arriving through third country resettlement and pay less and less attention to asylum seekers and those who have already been granted refugee status but did not come through resettlement . Asylum seekers have even been referred to as \\'queue jumpers \\' , because they did not wait for their chance to be resettled . Quality of life of asylum seekers and refugees is highly correlated with the mental health status . The presence of mental disorders like depression or PTSD is mainly due to the forced migration and the resettlement in host countries . Destitution Because asylum seekers often have to wait for months or years for the results of their asylum applications and because they are usually not allowed to work and only receive minimal or no financial support , destitution is a considerable risk . Asylum seekers usually get some kind of support from governments whilst their application is processed . However , in some countries this support ends immediately once they are given refugee status . But the fact that they were given refugee status does not mean that they were already given all the documents they need for starting their new lives . Long waiting times significantly reduce the likelihood to obtain a job and the social integration of refugees . Refusal of asylum It often happens that the country neither recognizes the refugee status of the asylum seekers nor sees them as legitimate migrants and thus treats them as illegal aliens . If an asylum claim has been rejected , the asylum seeker is said to be refused asylum , and called a failed asylum seeker . Some failed asylum seekers are allowed to remain temporarily , some return home voluntarily and some are forcibly returned . The latter are most often placed in immigration detention before being deported . In some cases in which asylum is not granted , the applicant is given the right to remain temporarily . In the UK , refused cases may be granted humanitarian protection ( usually for 5 years ) or discretionary leave to remain .

Paul Flaherty directed the film , which co-stars Annie Potts , Jeffrey Jones and Shawnee Smith . An uncredited cameo appearance is made by Jim Belushi . The story concerns the often incompetent , sometimes brilliant , private investigator Harry Crumb , who searches for a kidnapping victim . Plot While visiting a health studio in Beverly Hills , fashion model Jennifer Downing , the daughter of millionaire P.J . Downing , is kidnapped . Her father turns to a family friend , Eliot Draisen , who is president of the detective agency Crumb & Crumb , to investigate the case . Eliot is reluctant to supply P.J . with one of his capable detectives because , as it turns out , Eliot himself is the organizer of the kidnapping . To give the appearance of taking the investigation seriously , Eliot offers P.J . the services of Harry Crumb , the last descendant of the agency \\'s founders . Eliot knows that Harry is incompetent and counts on this fact to get away with the crime . Harry returns to Los Angeles ( by bus ) from an assignment in the firm \\'s Tulsa , Oklahoma branch office ( which he messed up , as usual ) . He is assisted in his investigation by P.J . \\'s younger daughter , Nikki , who is considerably smarter than he is . Harry deduces that Nikki \\'s stepmother , Helen Downing , is having an affair with tennis coach Vince Barnes , and concludes she is behind the kidnapping . Helen is desired by Eliot , but all she is interested in is money . She tries to get rid of her husband on several occasions and does her best – along with Barnes – to get the ransom for herself . Also assigned to the case is Police Detective Casey , who ( unlike Harry ) is competent and experienced in kidnapping cases , and has a strongly negative opinion of private eyes . Eliot escapes to the airport , bound for Buenos Aires . He makes the mistake of informing Helen of his plans ; she and Barnes take the money and leave him bound and gagged . Harry arrives to confront Helen and Barnes just as their plane prepares to take off . Jennifer is freed and Eliot is found . Falsely believing Harry has deduced his part in the kidnapping and exasperated with Harry \\'s dumb luck , Eliot confesses and is taken into police custody . Harry is thanked for his heroism in the case and even Det . Casey applauds Harry for solving the case . In the end , Harry takes over as the new president of his family \\'s business , and promptly accepts a new assignment to investigate another case , this time a murder committed in a gay bar .

It belongs to the Southern gothic and modernist literary genres . Set in the author \\'s present day , the interwar period , the novel centers on two strangers , a pregnant white woman and a man who passes as white but who believes himself to be of mixed ethnicity . In a series of flashbacks , the story reveals how these two people are connected to another man who has deeply impacted both their lives . In a loose , unstructured modernist narrative style that draws from Christian allegory and oral storytelling , Faulkner explores themes of race , sex , class , and religion in the American South . By focusing on characters who are misfits , outcasts , or otherwise marginalized in their community , he portrays the clash of alienated individuals against a Puritanical , prejudiced rural society . Early reception of the novel was mixed , with some reviewers critical of Faulkner \\'s style and subject matter . However , over time , the novel has come to be considered one of the most important literary works by Faulkner and one of the best English-language novels of the 20th century . Plot The novel is set in the American South in the 1930s , during the time of Prohibition and Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation in the South . It begins with the journey of Lena Grove , a young pregnant white woman from Doane \\'s Mill , Alabama , who is trying to find Lucas Burch , the father of her unborn child . He has been fired from his job in Doane \\'s Mill and moved to Mississippi , promising to send word to her when he has a new job . Not hearing from Burch and harassed by her older brother for her illegitimate pregnancy , Lena walks and hitchhikes to Jefferson , Mississippi , a town in Faulkner \\'s fictional Yoknapatawpha County . There she expects to find Lucas working at another planing mill , ready to marry her . Those who help her along her four-week trek are skeptical that Lucas Burch will be found , or that he will keep his promise when she catches up with him . When she arrives in Jefferson , Lucas is there , but he has changed his name to Joe Brown . Looking for Lucas , sweet , trusting Lena meets shy , mild-mannered Byron Bunch , who falls in love with Lena but feels honor-bound to help her find Joe Brown . Thoughtful and quietly religious , Byron is superior to Brown in every way , but his shyness prevents him from revealing his feelings to Lena . The novel then switches to the second plot strand , the story of Lucas Burch/Joe Brown \\'s partner Joe Christmas . The surly , psychopathic Christmas has been on the run for years , ever since at least injuring , perhaps even killing his strict Presbyterian adopted father . Although he has light skin , Christmas suspects that he is of African American ancestry . Consumed with rage , he is a bitter outcast who wanders between black and white society , constantly provoking fights with blacks and whites alike . Christmas comes to Jefferson three years prior to the central events of the novel and gets a job at the mill where Byron , and later Joe Brown , work . The job at the mill is a cover for Christmas \\'s bootlegging operation , which is illegal under Prohibition . He has a sexual relationship with Joanna Burden , an older woman who descended from a formerly powerful abolitionist family whom the town despises as carpetbaggers . Though their relationship is passionate at first , Joanna begins menopause and turns to religion , which frustrates and angers Christmas . At the end of her relationship with Christmas , Joanna tries to force him , at gunpoint , to kneel and pray . Joanna is murdered soon after : her throat is slit and she is nearly decapitated . The novel leaves readers uncertain whether Joe Christmas or Joe Brown is the murderer . Brown is Christmas \\' business partner in bootlegging and is leaving Joanna \\'s burning house when a passing farmer stops to investigate and pull Joanna \\'s body from the fire . The sheriff at first suspects Joe Brown , but initiates a manhunt for Christmas after Brown claims that Christmas is black . The manhunt is fruitless until Christmas arrives undisguised in Mottstown , a neighboring town ; he is on his way back to Jefferson , no longer running . In Mottstown , he is arrested and jailed , then moved to Jefferson . His grandparents arrive in town and visit Gail Hightower , the disgraced former minister of the town and friend of Byron Bunch . Bunch tries to convince Hightower to give the imprisoned Joe Christmas an alibi , but Hightower initially refuses . Though his grandfather wants Christmas lynched , his grandmother visits him in the Jefferson jail and advises him to seek help from Hightower . As police escort him to the local court , Christmas breaks free and runs to Hightower \\'s house . A childishly cruel white vigilante , Percy Grimm , follows him there and , over Hightower \\'s protest , shoots and castrates Christmas . Having redeemed himself at last , Hightower is then depicted as falling into a deathlike swoon , his whole life flashing before his eyes , including the past adventures of his Confederate grandfather , who was killed while stealing chickens from a farmer \\'s shed . Before Christmas \\' escape attempt , Hightower delivers Lena \\'s child in the cabin where Brown and Christmas had been staying before the murder , and Byron arranges for Brown/Burch to come and see her . Brown deserts Lena once again , but Byron follows him and challenges him to a fight . Brown beats the braver , smaller Bunch , then skillfully hops a moving train and disappears . At the end of the story , an anonymous man is talking to his wife about two strangers he picked up on a trip to Tennessee , recounting that the woman had a child and the man was not the father . This was Lena and Byron , who were conducting a half-hearted search for Brown , and they are eventually dropped off in Tennessee . Characters Major characters Lena Grove – a young pregnant woman from Alabama who has traveled to Jefferson while looking for Lucas Burch , the father of her unborn child . Byron Bunch – a bachelor who works at the planing mill in Jefferson , who meets and falls in love with Lena when she arrives in town .

Gail Hightower – the former minister of Jefferson , forced to retire after his wife was discovered to be having an affair in Memphis and committed suicide . He is a friend and mentor to Byron . Lucas Burch/Joe Brown – the young man who fathered Lena \\'s child in Alabama and ran away when she told him she was pregnant . He has been living in Jefferson with Joe Christmas in a cabin on Joanna Burden \\'s property under the name Joe Brown and working with Christmas and Byron at the planing mill . He is also a bootlegger . Joe Christmas – a man who came to Jefferson three years prior to the events in the novel . He lives in a cabin on the property of Joanna Burden and has a secret sexual relationship with her . Although he has light skin and is an orphan with no knowledge of his family background , he believes that one of his parents is of African-American ancestry , and this secret has caused him to be a habitual wanderer . He is employed at the planing mill until he begins to make a profit as a bootlegger . Joanna Burden – the sole survivor in Jefferson of a family of abolitionists from New England who came to Jefferson after the Civil War . She is unmarried , lives alone in a manor house outside of Jefferson , and is secretly engaged in a sexual relationship with Joe Christmas . She is murdered , presumably by Christmas , at the start of the novel , and her house is burned down . Secondary characters Eupheus \" Doc \" Hines – the grandfather of Joe Christmas . He hates Christmas and gives him away to an orphanage when he is born , staying on as a janitor there in order to monitor the boy . Later , when he hears that Christmas is being held on suspicion of murdering Joanna Burden , he travels to Jefferson with his wife and begins to incite a lynch mob to kill Christmas . Mrs . Hines – the grandmother of Joe Christmas . She has never seen Christmas after the night of his birth and travels to Jefferson to ensure that her husband does not successfully have him lynched , because she wants to see him again once more before he is tried for murder .

Armstid – Armstid \\'s wife , who gives Lena money in spite of her disdain for the young woman . Bobbie – a waitress at a restaurant in Memphis whom the adolescent Joe Christmas falls in love with and proposes to on the night that he kills his father at a local dance . She scorns him and leaves him . Gavin Stevens – an educated man and district attorney who lives in Jefferson and offers commentary on some of the events at the end of the novel . Percy Grimm – the captain of the State National Guard who kills Joe Christmas and castrates him . Style and structure Due to its naturalistic , violent subject matter and obsession with the ghosts of the past , Light in August is characterized as a Southern gothic novel , a genre also exemplified by the works of Faulkner \\'s contemporary Carson McCullers , and by later Southern writers like Flannery O\\'Connor , and Truman Capote . However , critics like Diane Roberts and David R . Jarraway view Faulkner \\'s use of Southern gothic genre tropes , such as the dilapidated plantation house and the focus on mystery and horror , as self-conscious modernist commentary on man \\'s \" warped relationship with the past \" and the impossibility of determining true identity . According to Daniel Joseph Singal , Faulkner \\'s literary style gradually developed from 19th century Victorian to modernist , with Light in August more firmly grounded in the tradition of the latter . The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polarities—light and dark , good and evil—the burden of history on the present , and the splintering of personal identity . The plot is also divided into dual currents , one focusing on Lena Grove and the other on Joe Christmas , a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works . The narrative is not structured in any particular order , as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another . This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics . As in his other novels , Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling , allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom . Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels , Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration , but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story . Title The title refers to the fire of the house that is at the center of the story . The whole novel revolves around one event , the fire , which is visible for miles around , and happens in August . Some critics have speculated that the meaning of the title derives from a colloquial use of the word \" light \" to mean giving birth—typically used to describe when a cow will give birth and be \" light \" again—and connect this to Lena \\'s pregnancy . Speaking of his choice of title , Faulkner denied this interpretation and stated , . . .in August in Mississippi there ’ s a few days somewhere about the middle of the month when suddenly there ’ s a foretaste of fall , it ’ s cool , there ’ s a lambence , a soft , a luminous quality to the light , as though it came not from just today but from back in the old classic times . It might have fauns and satyrs and the gods and—from Greece , from Olympus in it somewhere . It lasts just for a day or two , then it ’ s gone . . .the title reminded me of that time , of a luminosity older than our Christian civilization . \" Within the novel itself , the title is alluded to when Gail Hightower sits at his study window waiting for his recurring vision of his grandfather \\'s last raid . The vision always occurs in \" that instant when all light has failed out of the sky and it would be night save for that faint light which daygranaried leaf and grass blade reluctant suspire , making still a little light on earth though night itself has come . \" The story that would eventually become the novel , started by Faulkner in 1931 , was originally titled \" Dark House \" and began with Hightower sitting at a dark window in his home . However , after a casual remark by his wife Estelle on the quality of the light in August , Faulkner changed the title . Themes Alienation All of the protagonists in the novel are misfits and social outcasts surrounded by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community , which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters . Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded by the people of Jefferson for years , in a failed effort to make them leave town . Byron Bunch , though more accepted in Jefferson , is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked . Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans , strangers in town , and social outcasts , though the former draws anger and violence from the community , while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels . According to Cleanth Brooks , this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society . Christian allegory There are a variety of parallels with Christian scripture in the novel . The life and death of Joe Christmas is reminiscent of the passion of Christ , Lena and her fatherless child parallel Mary and Christ , and Byron Bunch acts as a Joseph figure . Christian imagery such as the urn , the wheel , and the shadow , can be found throughout . Light in August has 21 chapters , as does the Gospel of St . John . As Virginia V . James Hlavsa points out , each chapter in Faulkner corresponds to themes in John . For example , echoing John \\'s famous , \" In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God \" , is Lena \\'s insistent faith in the \" word \" of Lucas , who is , after all , the father . John 5 , the healing of the lame man by immersion , is echoed by Christmas \\'s repeatedly being immersed in liquids . The teaching in the temple in John 7 is echoed by McEachern \\'s attempts to teach Christmas his catechism . The crucifixion occurs in John 19 , the same chapter in which Christmas is slain and castrated . However , the Christian references are dark and disturbing—Lena is obviously not a virgin , Christmas is an enraged murderer—and may be more appropriately viewed as pagan idols mistakenly worshipped as saints . Race and sex Faulkner is considered one of the foremost American writers on race in the United States , and his novels , including Light in August , often explore the persistent obsession with blood and race in the South that have carried over from the antebellum era to the 21st century . Christmas has light skin but is viewed as a foreigner by the people he meets , and the children in the orphanage in which he was raised called him \" nigger . \" Chapter 6 begins with the oft-cited sentence : \" Memory believes before knowing remembers , \" and gives an account of the five year old Christmas amongst the uniform denim of the other children . The first reference to him though is not by these children but by the dietitian who gave him a dollar to not tell about her amorous adventure with an intern doctor . However suspicion must fall on Doc Hines Joe \\'s deranged grandfather who placed him in the orphanage and stays on as the boilerman . It is he who may have whispered the lie about the little boy \\'s origins to the other children . Because of this , Joe Christmas is fixated on the idea that he has some African American blood , which Faulkner never confirms , and views his parentage as an original sin that has tainted his body and actions since birth . Because of his obsessive struggle with his twin identities , black and white , Christmas lives his life always on the road . The secret of his blackness is one that he abhors as well as cherishes ; he often willingly tells white people that he is black in order to see their extreme reactions and becomes violent when one white Northern woman reacts nonchalantly . Though Christmas is guilty of violent crimes , Faulkner emphasizes that he is under the sway of social and psychological forces that are beyond his control and force him to reenact the part of the mythical black murderer and rapist from Southern history . Christmas exemplifies how existing outside of categorization , being neither black nor white , is perceived as a threat by society that can only be reconciled with violence . He is also perceived as neither male nor female , just as Joanna Burden , whom Faulkner portrays as \" masculinized , \" is also neither male nor female and is rejected by her community . Because of this , an early critic concluded that blackness and women were the \" \\'twin Furies of the Faulknerian deep Southern Waste Land \\' \" and reflected Faulkner \\'s animosity toward life . However , while women and minorities are both viewed as \" subversive \" and are restricted by the patriarchal society depicted in the novel , Lena Grove is able to travel safely and be cared for by people who hate and mistrust her , because she plays on the conventional rule that men are responsible for a woman \\'s wellbeing . Thus , she is the only stranger who is not alienated and destroyed by the people of Jefferson , because the community recognizes her as the embodiment of nature and life . This romantic view of women in the novel posits that men have lost their innocent connection to the natural world , while women instinctively possess it . Class and religion In Light in August , as in most of the other novels set in Yoknapatawpha County , Faulkner focuses mainly on poor white Southerners , both from the upper and lower classes , who struggle to survive in the ruined post-war economy of the South . The characters in Light in August—who are mostly from the lower classes , with the exception of Reverend Hightower and Joanna Burden—are united by poverty and Puritanical values that cause them to regard an unwed mother like Lena Grove with disdain . Faulkner shows the restrictiveness and aggression of their Puritanical zeal , which has caused them to become \" deformed \" in their struggle against nature . Reception When it was first published in 1932 , the novel was moderately successful ; 11,000 copies were initially printed , with a total of four printings by the end of the year , although a significant number of copies from the fourth printing had not been sold by 1936 . In 1935 , Maurice Coindreau translated the novel into French . In the same year , it was translated into German along with several other of Faulkner \\'s novels and short stories . These works initially met with approval from the Nazi censors and received much attention from German literary critics , because they assumed that Faulkner was a conservative agrarian positively depicting the struggle for racial purity ; soon after , however , Faulkner \\'s works were banned by the Nazis , and post-war German criticism reappraised him as an optimistic Christian humanist . Faulkner \\'s books were not available in Germany until 1951 because US army censors also did not approve of his work . According to Michael Millgate , though it is not typically considered Faulkner \\'s best novel , Light in August was recognized early on as being \" a major text , central to any understanding or evaluation of his career as a whole . \" He argues that many of the early American critics , most of whom were urban Northerners who viewed the South as backward and reactionary , focused on Faulkner \\'s technical innovation in the field of narrative but missed or ignored the regional details and interconnectedness of the characters and setting to other works by the author . Some reviewers saw Faulkner \\'s narrative techniques not as innovations but as errors , offering Faulkner recommendations on how to improve his style and admonishing him for his European modernist \" tricks \" . Critics were also displeased with the violence depicted in the novel , pejoratively labeling it \" gothic fantasy , \" despite the fact that lynching was a reality in the South . In spite of these complaints , the novel came to be viewed positively because of its violence and dark themes , as this was a contrast to the sentimental , romantic Southern literature of the time . In 1998 , the Modern Library ranked Light in August 54th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century . Additionally , Time magazine included the novel in its TIME 100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005 .

A condensed version was published as an Armed Services Edition during WWII . Critical reception While many reviewers \" praised the story for its relevance , comparing Amber \\'s fortitude during the plague and fire to that of the women who held hearth and home together through the blitzes of World War II \" , others condemned it for its blatant sexual references . Fourteen US states banned the book as pornography . The first was Massachusetts , whose attorney general cited 70 references to sexual intercourse , 39 illegitimate pregnancies , 7 abortions , and \" 10 descriptions of women undressing in front of men \" as reasons for banning the novel . Winsor denied that her book was particularly daring and said that she had no interest in explicit scenes . \" I wrote only two sexy passages , \" she remarked , \" and my publishers took both of them out . They put in ellipses instead . In those days , you know , you could solve everything with an ellipsis . \" Despite its banning , Forever Amber was the best-selling US novel of the 1940s . It sold over 100,000 copies in its first week of release , and went on to sell over three million copies . Forever Amber was also responsible for popularizing \" Amber \" as a given name for girls in the 20th century . The book was condemned by the Catholic Church for indecency , which helped its popularity . One critic went so far as to number each of the passages to which he objected . A film adaptation by 20th Century Fox was finally completed after substantial changes to the script were made , toning down some of the book \\'s most objectionable passages in order to appease Catholic media critics . The book was banned in August 1945 in Australia .

( Arabic : ) is the literal term meaning paradise which was borrowed from the Persian word ( ) , being also the source of the English word \" paradise \" , but the Qur\\'an generally uses the term Jannah symbolically referring to paradise . However , \" Firdaus \" also designates the highest level of heaven . In contrast to Jannah , the words and are used to refer to the concept of hell . There are many words in the Arabic language for both Heaven and Hell and those words also appear in the Quran and hadith . Most of them have become part of the Islamic belief . Heaven and Jannah While Jannah in the Quran is often translated as \" Heaven \" in the sense of an abode where believers are rewarded in afterlife , samāʾ ( usually pl . samāwāt ) is the word for heaven in the sense of space or celestial sphere , as \" seven heavens \" ( 2:29 , 78:12 ) . Some sources connect the two in some way . According to Sufi cosmology , Paradise is often depicted as being above the seven heavens or between the sixth and seventh heaven . In some modern interpretations , based on Qur\\'an 21:30 and 67:5 , the lowest heaven is also interpreted as the observable universe , with the other six beyond , once were amassed together and later expanded . Images and descriptions Quran The Quran gives an idyllic description of Jannah . It says that each person that goes to Jannah is greeted by angels from every gate with the words , \" Peace be upon you , because ye have endured with patience ; how excellent a reward is paradise ! \" ( Q13:24 ) Each person lives near to the Lord in a garden ( 3:15 ) of perpetual bliss ( 13:23 ) , with flowing springs ( 88:10–16 ) , and flowing rivers ( 5:119 ) 7 of incorruptible water and unchangeable milk ( 47:15 ) . Each garden is the width of the whole heavens and earth ( 3:133 ) . In each garden is a mansion ( 9:72 ) , a high throne ( 88:10–16 ) of dignity ( 52:20 ) in a grove of cool shade ( 36:56–57 ) , an adorned couch ( 18:31 ) , rows of cushions , rich carpets spread out , a cup ( Q88:10–16 ) full of wine ( 52:23 ) , and every meat ( 52:22 ) and fruit ( Q36:56–57 ) that is like the food on Earth ( Q2:25 ) . Each person is adorned in golden and pearl bracelets ( Q35:33 ) and green garments of fine silk and brocade ( Q18:31 ) . Both men and women will have beautiful and pure spouses ( Q2:25 , Q4:57 ) , accompanied by any children that did not go to Jahannam ( Q52:21 ) , and attended to by servant-boys with the spotless appearance similar to a protected pearls ( Q52:24 ) . The Believers Men will get untouched ( Q55:56 ) virgin companions of equal age ( 56:35-38 ) and have large , beautiful eyes ( 37:48 ) . Jannah is described as an eternal dwelling ( Q3:136 ) , with its supreme felicity and greatest bliss being God \\'s good pleasure ( Q9:72 ) . Hadith The Paradise is described as surrounded by eight principal gates , each level generally being divided into a hundred degrees guarded by angels ( in some traditions Ridwan ) . The highest level is known as ( sometimes called Eden ) or Illiyin . Entrants will be greeted by angels with salutations of peace or As-Salamu Alaykum . Furthermore , paradise is considered to be \" as vast as the heavens and the earth \" . In the classical interpretation of the Quran , \" the Garden \" is described with material delights , such as beautiful maidens for men and beautiful virgin men for women , precious stones , delicious foods , and constantly flowing water—the latter especially appealing to the desert dwelling Arabs , who spend most of their life in arid lands . The Islamic texts describes life for its immortal inhabitants as : one that is happy—without hurt , sorrow , fear or shame—where every wish is fulfilled . Traditions relate that inhabitants will be of the same age ( 33 years ) , and of the same standing . Their life is one of bliss including wearing sumptuous robes , bracelets and perfumes as they partake in exquisite banquets served in priceless vessels by immortal youths ( Houri ) , as they recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones . According to Muslim belief , everything one longs for while in this world will be there in Paradise . Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents , spouses , and children ( provided they were admitted to paradise ) —conversing and recalling the past . The names of four rivers are Saihan ( Syr Darya ) , Jaihan ( Amu Darya ) , Furat ( Euphrates ) and Nil ( Nile ) . Salsabil is the name of a spring that is the source of the rivers of Rahma ( mercy ) and Al-Kawthar ( abundance ) . Sidrat al-Muntaha is a Lote tree that marks the end of the seventh heaven , the boundary where no angel or human can pass . In spite of the goodly dwellings given to the inhabitants of paradise , the approval of God and nearness to Him is considered greater . According to the Quran , God will bring the elect near to his throne ( ) , a day on which \" some faces shall be shining in contemplating their Lord . \" The vision of God is regarded as the greatest of all rewards , surpassing all other joys . The true beauty of paradise is also understood as the joy of beholding God , the Creator . Besides the material notion of the paradise , those descriptions are also interpreted as allegories , explaining the state of joy people will get . For some theologians , seeing God is not a question of sight , but of awareness of God \\'s presence . Although early Sufis , such as Hallaj , took the descriptions of Paradise literal , later Sufi traditions usually stressed out the allegorical meaning . The Sunni Persian theologian Al-Ghazali said : Houris , who live in paradise , are described as women who will accompany faithful Muslims in Paradise . Muslim scholars differ as to whether they refer to the believing women of this world or a separate creation , with the majority opting for the latter . Inhabitants Muslims According to the Quran , the basic criterion for salvation in the afterlife is the belief in the oneness of God ( ) , angels of God , revealed books of God , all messengers of God , as well as repentance to God , and doing good deeds . Though one must do good deeds and believe in God , salvation can only be attained through God \\'s judgment . Regarding salvation from hell , according to hadith literature , Muhammad said , “ Surely a time will come over hell when its gates shall be blown by wind , there shall be none in it , and this shall be after they have remained therein for many years . ” Still in the Hadith literature , Muhammad is reported to have said , \" Allah will bring out people from the Fire and admit them into Paradise . \" Otherwise some hadiths indicate , that the majority of mankind will not access heaven . According to Islam , a Muslim , even if condemned to Jahannam , will eventually enter Jannah . As in life there are many trials which one must face . This is also a condition individuals must encounter in order to enter Jannah . Several precise numbers are mentioned in the hadith literature regarding the extremely high standards required to qualify for Jannah . Initially , a select elite group of 70,000 people from the followers of Muhammad will enter Jannah without any accountability of their sins . After the above group , only 1 out of 1000 people from the rest of humanity ( Muslim ) would qualify for Jannah . It is understood that despite this small percentage , the actual number of people who would make it to Jannah would be higher , as Allah would forgive the sins of many people , allowing them to enter Jannah as well so long as they have even an atoms weight of Iman ( Faith ) in their hearts . Accepting Islam is a requisite to gaining Allah \\'s Mercy insofar as the Message of Islam has reached one \\'s knowledge Shaheed A shahid ( witness or martyr ) is considered one whose place in Jannah is promised . Sunni sources such as Ibn Kathir , as well as Shia sources cite Quran At-Tawbah 9:111 in support of this view . Non-Muslims There are different opinions among scholars in regard whether non-Muslims could enter Jannah . Some Muslims and Islamic scholars argued Surah 2:62 indicates Jannah is not exclusively for Muslims . Indeed , those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or Sabians—those who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did righteousness—will have their reward with their Lord , and no fear will there be concerning them , nor will they grieve . On the other hand , other scholars hold this verse is abrogated by Surah 3:85 and just applied until the arrival of Muhammad . For example , before Jesus was born , Jewish people will enter Jannah and so will Christians who lived before Muhammad , but every religious group must accept the latest prophet \\'s teachings ( that is , the most recent prophet of their time ) . And whoever desires other than Islam as religion—never will it be accepted from him , and he , in the Hereafter , will be among the losers . Scholars like Ibn Arabi did not hold the first to be abrogated by the latter , since \" Islam \" in this context , does not apply to Islam as a religious tradition , but to \" submission \" . Modernist scholars Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida are also rejecting the notion that the People of the Book are excluded from Jannah , with reference to Quran 4:123-124 . In Iran , People of the Book who were on the Iranian side during the Iran–Iraq War are regarded as martyrs , which is why the Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei regularly visits the families of fallen Christian soldiers at Christmas , and Iranian Jewish soldiers are honored and memorialized for their sacrifice . Ghazali distinguished between the \" saved \" and \" those who will attain success \" . Therefore , righteous non-Muslims will neither enter hell nor Jannah , but will stay in Araf . The Fate of the unlearned is also a matter of dispute within Islamic theology . Further those who regard Jannah as exclusively for Muslims argue , that Islam is the \" completed \" and \" perfected \" religion and it is necessary to believe in the whole teaching of God , the prophets and the angels that just can be done by a Muslim . Islam theologian Süleyman Ateş argues , Muslims had made the same mistake Jews and Christians made before by claiming Jannah is exclusive to Muslims only . Further he states , that those who believe in God without associating any partners with Him , believe in the hereafter without any doubt and do good and useful deeds can enter paradise , conditions several religions offer . He also refers to the Quran that there are good and bad people among any religion , and even not all Muslims may enter paradise . Finally , most scholars agree that non-Muslims who did not hear the message of Islam and non-Muslims who died in childhood are eligible for Jannah as well , based on the following verse : And We never punish until We have sent a Messenger ( to give warning ) . Supernatural creatures Islamic scholars debated whether or not , the jinn can enter Jannah . It is clear from the Quran , that the jinn might be thrown into Jahannam ( hell ) , but does not mention explicitly the presence of jinn in Jannah . Houris are explicitly described as \" untouched by human and jinn \" indicates , that jinn could enter Jannah , too . Others however , deny the possibility for jinn to enter Jannah , they could merely try to avoid hell . Accordingly , in the afterlife the fires of hell will be brought forth to the jinn . While the infidel jinn will suffer in the flames , the pious jinn will turn to dust before they touch the flames . Other traditions explain , in more detail , the nature of jinn in paradise , such as inverting the invisibility of jinn , thus the jinn will turn into fixed forms , while they can not see humans anymore . The mention of a reward relating to the believers is in Surah Al-Jinn : \" When we heard the guidance ˹of the Quran˺ , we ˹readily˺ believed in it . For whoever believes in their Lord will have no fear of being denied ˹a reward˺ or wronged . \" According to Abu Hanifa , founder of the Hanafi schools jurisprudence of Sunnism , the jinn might enter jannah , but , just like angels , they will receive no reward . Impossibility to enter jannah only applies to the devils ( shayatin ) . Quranic names Layers of Jannah – The Highest Gardens of Paradise ( , Al-Mu ’ minoon ) – The Home ( ) Jannatul Aliyah ( suras Haqqah , Ghashiyah ) – Home of Peace ( , ) – The Home in the Hereafter ( ) – This is the most commonly used term in the Quran and Hadith . ( , Āl ‘ Imran , ) – Gardens of Everlasting Bliss ( : 72 , ) – The Eternal Gardens ( ) – Garden of Abode ( ) – The Gardens of Delight ( , , al-Ḥajj ) – Assembly of Truth ( ) – The House of Security ( ) Doors of Jannah According to hadith , there are eight doors of Jannah . Their names are as following : : For those who were punctual in prayer : For those who took part in jihad : For those who gave charity more often : For those who fasted ( siyam ) : For those participated in the annual pilgrimage : For those who withheld their anger and forgave others : For those who by virtue of their faith are saved from reckoning and chastisement : For those who showed zeal in remembering Allah Comparison with other religions Comparison with Judaism Jannah shares the name \" Garden of the Righteous \" with the Jewish concept of paradise . In addition , paradise in Judaism is described as a garden , much like the Garden of Eden , where people live and walk and dance with God and his angels , wear garments of light , and eat the fruit of the tree of life . Like the feast of Jannah , Jewish eschatology describes the messiah holding a Seudat nissuin , called the Seudat Chiyat HaMatim , with the righteous of every nation at the end time . Comparison with Christianity Jesus in the Gospels uses various images for heaven that are similarly found in Jannah : feast , mansion , throne , and paradise . However , the Book of Revelation describes the new heavens and earth as the new Jerusalem , whereas Jannah does not include cities . Vision of Don Bosco In an alleged private revelation , John Bosco describes visiting a garden beautiful beyond description , with trees made of gemstones and mansions too great to describe . His guide tells him that he \\'s in paradise .

( noun ) count , number ; pl . minyaním ) is the quorum of ten Jewish adults required for certain religious obligations . In more traditional streams of Judaism , only males 13 and older may constitute a minyan ; in more liberal ( non-Orthodox ) streams women are also counted . The most common activity requiring a minyan is public prayer . Accordingly , the term minyan in contemporary Judaism has taken on the secondary meaning of referring to a prayer service . Sources The source for the requirement of minyan is recorded in the Talmud . The word minyan itself comes from the Hebrew root meaning to count or to number . The word is related to the Aramaic word mene , numbered , appearing in the writing on the wall in . Babylonian Talmud The Babylonian Talmud ( Megillah 23b ) derives the requirement of a minyan of ten shomer Shabbat for Kiddush Hashem and Devarim she-Bikdusha , \" matters of sanctity \" , by combining three scriptural verses using the rule of : The word \" midst \" in the verse : And I shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel ( ) also appears in the verse : Separate yourselves from the midst of the congregation ( ) The term \" congregation \" is also used in another verse that describes the ten spies who brought back a negative report of the Land of Israel : How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me ? ( ) From this combination , the Talmud concludes that \" sanctification \" should occur in the \" midst \" of a \" congregation \" of ten . Jerusalem Talmud The Jerusalem Talmud ( Megillah 4:4 ) offers two sources for the requirement , also using a : The word \" congregation \" in the verse : Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel , and say to them : You shall be holy ( ) is also used in another verse : How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me ? ( ) Since the term \" congregation \" in the later verse refers to the ten spies , so too in the former verse : \" You shall be holy \" refers to a \" congregation \" of ten . The second source is based on the term \" children of Israel \" which appears in the following two verses : And I shall be sanctified in the midst of the children of Israel ( ) And the children of Israel came to buy among those that came ( ) Just as the \" children of Israel \" in the later verse refers to the ten sons of Jacob who descended to Egypt to obtain food during the famine , so too the former verse refers to sanctification among the “ children of Israel ” in the presence of ten . Rituals requiring a minyan Some rituals require a minyan ; the presence of a rabbi ( a teacher , not a priest ) is not essential—it is said that \" nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan , but ten cobblers can \" . The following instances which require a minyan are listed in the Mishnah in Megillah ( 4:3 ) : Public worship , which consists of the additional readings of Kaddish , Barechu , Kedusha and the Repetition of the Amidah . The minor tractate Soferim contains a passage ( 10:7 ) often interpreted as asserting that in Land of Israel at that time seven men were allowed to hold public services . Correctly interpreted it refers to the repeating of \" Kaddish \" and \" Barechu \" at the synagogue for the benefit of late comers , and declares that in Israel such a repetition is permitted only when seven ( according to others , when six ) men are present who have not yet heard these responsive readings . The priestly blessing . Reading from the Torah and Prophets with the associated benedictions . Seven benedictions recited at a wedding , or at any meal of the bridegroom and bride within a week from the wedding . Using the formulation \" Let us bless our God , from whose wealth we have eaten , \" in preparing for Grace after meals . Ancient funeral ceremonies , no longer in use , which incorporated arranging the standing and sitting , reciting the benedictions of the mourners and the consolation of the mourners . Other instances which require the presence of a minyan include : Recitation of the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy Recitation of Birkat ha-Gomel . While the required quorum for most activities requiring a quorum is usually ten , it is not always so . For example , the Passover sacrifice or Korban Pesach ( from the days of the Temple in Jerusalem ) must be offered before a quorum of 30 . ( It must be performed in front of kahal adat yisrael , the assembly of the congregation of Israel . Ten are needed for the assembly , ten for the congregation , and ten for Israel . ) According to some Talmudic authorities , women counted in the minyan for offering the Korban Pesach ( e.g . Rav , Rav Kahana , Pesachim 79b ) . Prayer with a minyan It was the firm belief of the sages that wherever ten Israelites are assembled , either for worship or for the study of the Law , the Divine Presence dwells among them . In rabbinical literature , those who meet for study or prayer in smaller groups , even one who meditates or prays alone , are to be praised . However , the stress is put upon the merits and sacredness of the minyan of ten . The codifiers , such as Maimonides , his annotators , and the author of the Shulkhan Arukh , have unitedly given strength to this sentiment , and have thus , for more than a thousand years , made the daily attendance at public worship , morning and evening , to be conducted with a quorum of ten . There is a disagreement between the medieval commentators on whether prayer with a minyan is preferable or obligatory . Rashi is of the view that an individual is obligated to pray with a minyan , while Nahmanides holds that only if ten adult males are present are they obliged to recite their prayer together , but an individual is not required to seek out a minyan . Rashi and the Tosafot are both of the opinion that one is required to travel the distance of 4 mil to pray with a minyan . The Mishnah Berurah writes that one who is sitting at home must travel up to one mil . Eligibility There is much discussion in rabbinic literature on the matter of who is eligible to be counted in a minyan . Some discussions revolve around whether or not a minyan should consist of individuals who are obligated in performance of that particular precept . Some authorities deduce who may constitute a minyan by drawing on the verses which are brought as the basis for minyan and their implication . For example , the verse , \" How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me ? \" is referring to the ten spies , a congregation comprising Jewish adult males . It is understood from this that a minyan must likewise comprise ten Jewish adult males . Other classical sources base their rulings on discussions brought in the Talmud . Contemporary rabbinical authorities deal with a plethora of questions relating to qualification for minyan . Minors Before a boy turns thirteen , he is considered a minor in Jewish law and is not obligated in the performance of religious precepts . However , if a child is over six years of age and has adequate comprehension of the significance of the precepts , his status may change . His inclusion in minyan is thus subject of Talmudic dispute . Based on the Talmudic passage in Berachot , Rabbeinu Tam states that a minor can act as the tenth person and according to the Baal Ha-Maor , up to four minors would be permitted . Rosh explains that those who permit the inclusion of a minor maintain that it is the Divine Presence which actually constitutes the tenth member , thereby validating the minyan . ( This may explain why some of these authorities require that the minor represent this fact by holding a chumash . ) However the majority of poskim follow the conclusion of the Ri who holds that a minor can never be counted in a minyan under any circumstances . This is the stance taken by the Shulchan Aruch , who , although acknowledging some authorities do permit the inclusion of an astute six-year-old , writes that consensus rejects this view and only males over the age of thirteen may constitute a minyan . However , in extraordinary circumstances some are lenient and permit a minor over six years old holding a chumash or Sefer Torah to complete a minyan . Women Although the issue of whether women are permitted to make up a minyan has been noted in early works , the matter has only come to the fore in the past few decades , a reaction to an enhanced role of women in modern society and to the demand for their inclusion in all areas of religious life . The Talmud itself does not directly address the question of whether women may count as part of a minyan for devarim shebkdusha . Since the Talmud uses the same gezerah shavah for Kiddush Hashem as it uses for devarim shebkdusha , one may expect the laws for those two cases to be the same . Many authorities are of the opinion that women are included in the minyan for Kiddush Hashem and Hillul Hashem . However , traditional codifiers generally do not include women in the minyan for devarim shebkdusha . The Talmud ( Arakhin 3a ) relates that women are required to recite zimmun of three participants , and Berakhot 45 says that women may recite the zimmun . However , the majority of scholars are of the opinion that ten women may not recite the additional form of zimun be-Shem , which is obligatory when ten men are present . The few authorities who do permit ten women to use the zimmun be-Shem formulation explain that the necessity for ten in this case is unique and can not be compared to other instances requiring minyan . Only Rabbeinu Simcha among these authorities mentions the possibility of one woman \\'s joining with nine men to form a minyan for prayer . This isolated opinion is rejected by the codifiers . There are a number of cases , including reading of the megillah , where a limited number of authorities count women towards the minyan . However , in these cases the reason why women are counted is not because they constitute a \" congregation , \" but rather because a public audience is required . A possible reason why it is men who were obligated to form a congregation in order to convene the Divine Presence is that women were individually considered sufficiently holy and did not require the combination of a group and special prayers to achieve added holiness deficient in men . Due to the righteousness of the women in the wilderness , they did not suffer the same deadly fate as their male counterparts , and despite the spies ’ negative report about the holy land , wished to enter it . Others point to the sociological reality that women were traditionally expected to care for the house and children . The Jewish tradition did not require women to leave their social role to engage in public prayer . Reform In 1845 , rabbis attending the Frankfort Synod of the emerging Reform Judaism declared that women count in a minyan , a formalization of a customary Reform practice dating back to 1811 . Conservative In 1973 , the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of Conservative Judaism voted to count men and women equally as members of a minyan . In 2002 , the Committee adapted a responsum by Rabbi David Fine which provides an official religious-law foundation for women counting in a minyan and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer . This responsum holds that , although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men , Conservative women have , as a collective whole , voluntarily undertaken them . Because of this collective undertaking , the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others . The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning . By adopting this responsum , the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices , without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments , undermine the religious importance of community and clergy , ask individual women intrusive questions , repudiate the halakhic tradition , or label women following traditional practices as sinners . Transgressors The question of whether a sinner can be counted for a minyan has become much more pertinent in recent generations , where a general malaise in religious observance among the majority of Jews has occurred . The Shulchan Aruch states that though a person may be a notorious and habitual sinner and has even committed a capital offense unless a person has been placed under a religious ban due to his sinful behavior , he is counted among the ten . The source provided for this sentiment is from the incident with Achan who , despite having been put to death for his transgression , was still referred to as a Jew . However , the Pri Megadim explains that this is only true if he sins for self-satisfaction , but if a person sins to spite God or has openly severed their connection with the Jewish people by professing a hostile creed or by publicly desecrating the Shabbat , such a person is prohibited from constituting a minyan . Nevertheless , many contemporary authorities have been driven to adopt a lenient view in the face of widespread public non-observance of the Shabbat , on the presumption that it does not indicate a deliberate denial of faith , but is rather a result of ignorance and succumbing to the pressure of social and economic conditions . Proselytes Even though Tosafot deduce from the Talmud in Sukkah 38b that wherever the verse states “ children of Israel ” it comes to exclude a proselyte unless there is specific clause for inclusion , here with regard to minyan the sources state that there is no reasoning to exclude a full-fledged proselyte . Since such a person is permitted to act as a prayer leader , obviously they can count towards a minyan . Those who are unable to respond As long as a person is of sufficient intelligence , he can be included in the minyan , even if he is unable to respond to the prayers which make the presence of ten a necessity . According to some sources , this is because as long as ten are gathered the Divine Presence descends and it is feasible to pronounce a Dvar she\\'bekedusha . This includes someone who is in the middle of his prayers but is precluded from responding to the hazzan ’ s incantations and someone who is mute but can hear the prayers . ( Someone who is deaf but has the ability and knows when to respond can also be included . ) There is however a dispute regarding someone who is asleep or intoxicated . Such a person has sufficient intelligence , but at present can neither hear or respond . Ideally he should be woken to the extent that he is dozing , but in extraneous circumstances where it impossible to arouse him , it is permitted to include the maximum of one sleeping person in the minyan . In the case of a drunkard , the accepted view is that even if he has not reached the “ drunkenness of Lot ” , he still can not be included . A minimum of six of those gathered in the minyan have a duty to listen attentively and respond appropriately to the additional prayers and that at least nine are required to respond for the repetition of the Amidah . Arrangement It is not just the status of the individual which dictates eligibility ; the physical arrangement of the minyan is also a factor . Maimonides delineates the confines which are placed on the arrangement of the people making up a minyan . Ideally all the members of the minyan should be gathered in one room . However , if they are within hearing distance of one another , it is permitted for the ten to be distributed in two adjoining rooms . Later authorities limit the extent of this opinion and rule that even if there is an opening between the two rooms , the two groups are still considered separate entities . Only in unusual circumstances is it permitted , as long as some of the men in each room can see each other . Ten-and-ten minyan ( ten men and ten women ) Over the last decade or so , more and more lay-led worship communities have formed that attempt to combine commitment to traditional Jewish law with a push for increased participation and recognition of the role of women . While many are simply referred to as independent minyanim , the term used by the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance for those groups that consider themselves part of the Modern Orthodox community is partnership minyan . Many of these groups have adopted the custom initially instituted by Shira Hadasha in Jerusalem to wait for a \" ten-and-ten minyan \" , made up of ten men and ten women . Shira Hadasha has based many of its decisions on the writings of rabbis like Mendel Shapiro and Daniel Sperber . Some also use the Guide for the Halakhic Minyan , a compendium of halakhic sources supporting increased participation by women in services , as a basis for discussions of practices like the ten-and-ten minyan .

Nominated for the 1955 National Book Award for Fiction , The Bad Seed tells the story of a mother \\'s realization that her young daughter is a murderer . Its enormous critical and commercial success was largely realized after March \\'s death only one month after publication . In 1954 , the novel was adapted into a successful and long-running Broadway play by Maxwell Anderson and into an Academy Award-nominated film directed by Mervyn LeRoy in 1956 . Synopsis Eight-year-old Rhoda Penmark appears to be what every little girl brought up in a loving home should be . Outwardly , she is charming , polite and intelligent beyond her years . To most adults , she \\'s every parent \\'s dream : obedient , well-groomed , and compliant . She reads books , does her homework , and practices her piano scales , all without being asked by her parents . However , most children keep their distance from her , sensing there is something not quite right about her . This is especially true for the students at Fern Grammar School , her new school in a small town named Benedict . Rhoda is the only child of Christine Penmark and her husband Kenneth , who goes away on business . Christine begins to notice that Rhoda acts strangely toward Claude Daigle , one of her classmates , who mysteriously drowns at a school picnic later . She then notices that Rhoda is indifferent to the boy \\'s death , which is presumed accidental , albeit with one unexplained detail : His face was imprinted with crescent-shaped marks . Christine learns that Rhoda quarreled with Claude over a medal award for perfect penmanship that the boy won , but which Rhoda believed she deserved . She also lied about the last time she saw Claude . Faced with Rhoda \\'s deception , Christine begins to reevaluate troubling incidents from the past . After Rhoda had begged her parents for a pet dog , she quickly became bored with it , and the animal died in what she described as an \" accidental fall \" from the window . Clara Post , an elderly neighbor , had promised her a special snow globe upon her death , and soon after , suffered a fatal fall while babysitting Rhoda , who now proudly owns the trinket . Additionally , Rhoda was once expelled from a school for repeatedly being caught lying to teachers and staff who described her as a \" cold , self-sufficient child \" . Disturbed by the idea that her daughter might indeed be the one behind all these tragedies , Christine begins investigating and discovers that she was adopted by her parents , including investigative journalist Richard Bravo , when she was found as the sole survivor of a murdering spree . Her birth mother was Bessie Denker , a notorious serial killer who died in the electric chair , and of whom Christine has vague memories . Christine blames herself for passing on the murderous \" bad seed \" gene to her child , yet clings to the hope that Rhoda might have killed Claude by accident . She writes a series of tortured letters to her husband about Rhoda but never mails them in fear of what may happen if someone reads the letters and goes to the authorities . In all this investigation , Christine slowly begins to deteriorate and become a shell of her former self , which is immediately noticed by Monica Breedlove , Christine \\'s friend and neighbor . Leroy Jessup , the maintenance man who lives and works at the Penmarks \\' apartment complex , is the only other adult besides Christine who sees through Rhoda \\'s facade . Believing she simply has a mean streak , Leroy relentlessly teases her , pretending to believe that she is responsible for Claude \\'s death . Leroy \\'s wife Thelma warns him about harassing the girl , but he refuses to listen . Rhoda is unfazed by his teasing until Leroy teases that she must \\'ve used her cleated shoes to beat Claude , explaining the crescent-shaped marks left on the boy \\'s face . Immediately after , he realizes he stumbled onto the truth by the way Rhoda reacts to his accusations . Afraid he will expose her , she waits until Leroy is asleep and lights his mattress ablaze before locking him inside . A horrified Christine witnesses the murder from a distance ; it occurs so quickly she has no time to get help . Others believe his death to be accidental , from falling asleep while smoking , thus starting the fire . Christine confronts Rhoda , who initially attempts to lie and manipulate her mother before finally confessing to killing Claude , Leroy , and Clara Post , all the while expressing no remorse . Christine fears her daughter will end up like Bessie Denker in the electric chair . In a desperate attempt to prevent Rhoda from killing anyone else , Christine secretly gives her sleeping pills so she will die painlessly in an overdose . She then shoots herself in the head with a pistol that was in her nightstand . Christine later dies in the hospital . However , a neighbor hears the gunshot and saves Rhoda . A heartbroken Kenneth returns home , believing Christine had suffered a nervous breakdown . Because Christine had destroyed her unsent letters and other evidence , Rhoda is free to kill again . Character list Major characters Rhoda Penmark : Rhoda is portrayed as a high-functioning sociopath , although the term was not widely used at the time the book was written . She has no conscience , and will not hesitate to harm or kill whoever stands in her way at achieving her goal . She sees murder as something that is necessary if she believes her target to be a potential threat . An adept manipulator , Rhoda can easily charm and mislead adults , while eliciting fear and revulsion from other children , who can sense that something is wrong with her . It is implied that she inherited these traits from her maternal grandmother Bessie Denker , who was a famous convicted serial killer . By the time her mother Christine puts the facts together , Rhoda has already killed at least two people and a dog . She also kills Leroy Jessup , the apartment building \\'s live-in gardener . When Christine uncovers Rhoda \\'s dark secret , she attempts murder-suicide by Rhoda by giving her enough pills to cause an overdose and shooting herself however proves to be unsuccessful when their landlady saves Rhoda \\'s life . Rhoda is indifferent to her mother \\'s suicide and it is implied she will follow in the footsteps of her infamous grandmother . Christine Penmark : The young and empathetic mother of Rhoda Penmark . Christine is described as very beautiful . She has Nordic feminine features that are traced to her biological father . She is well-groomed , intelligent , and despite being a submissive 1950s homemaker , she is very independent . She slowly pieces together that Rhoda is a killer . Christine does n\\'t know whether she should love or hate her daughter , but knows that Rhoda will kill again if something is not done . She discovers that her own biological mother was Bessie Denker , an infamous serial killer who was executed . In the end , Christine finally attempts to kill Rhoda to stop her , then shoots herself in the head . Leroy Jessup : The crude maintenance man who works for the elderly landlady , Monica Breedlove . He is a depraved individual and sees Rhoda as a kindred spirit . Due to his crude mind and dark sense of humor , he is the only adult character , other than Christine , who notices that Rhoda is unlike other children and enjoys teasing her . Rhoda only reacts to his teasing when he claims to have the shoes with which she killed Claude . When the realization sets in that she actually did kill Claude , he denies ever having them . Shortly thereafter , he is locked inside his makeshift shed by Rhoda , who sets the shed on fire , leaving him inside to die . Monica Breedlove : The Penmarks \\' landlady and Christine \\'s confidante , she is an older pretentious woman who considers herself to be somewhat of a psychotherapist and claims she was once examined by Sigmund Freud . Monica adores Rhoda , whom she believes to be extraordinary , even wishing the child were hers . Monica knows that Christine is upset but suspects she is either ill , or that her marriage with Kenneth is under strain . Monica never discovers the truth about Rhoda and is confused as to why Christine would kill herself . At the end of the novel , she saves Rhoda \\'s life but it is implied that Rhoda is plotting to kill her next . Reginald Tasker : A writer and friend to Monica , he provides Christine with information about an infamous serial killer , Bessie Denker . He is becomes friends and later is to attracted to Christine . He informs Christine that the man she has known as her biological father , Richard Bravo , worked diligently on the Denker case . Tasker mentions that Bessie Denker \\'s youngest daughter was her only surviving family . Claude Daigle : The only child of Hortense and Dwight Daigle , he is described as a timid and shy boy who rarely stood up to others . He is never seen but it is discerned that he was last seen running away from Rhoda at a school picnic . He refused to give her the penmanship medal award he had won but which she declared to be hers . Rhoda repeatedly hit Claude so hard with her shoe that she knocked him unconscious and he fell into the lake and quickly drowned . Bessie Denker : A well-known ( fictional ) serial killer . She is the biological mother of Christine Penmark and the grandmother of Rhoda Penmark . Christine faintly remembers living with her biological family and escaping from her mother . Denker never makes a physical appearance in the novel , having long ago been executed . The character \\'s life and murderous history is thoroughly described in the notes of Reginald Tasker . Denker \\'s career is based very roughly on the real-life careers of Belle Gunness and Jane Toppan . The description of her execution in the electric chair is based on that of Ruth Snyder . Minor characters Kenneth Penmark : The father of Rhoda and husband of Christine . Kenneth is away on business when the novel begins and he does not return until the very end , after his wife \\'s suicide . Kenneth never discovers the truth about Rhoda or the reasoning behind Christine \\'s suicide and attempted murder of Rhoda as his wife neglected to leave him any information , even confidentially , and had destroyed her earlier unsent letters . Emory Wages : Monica Breedlove \\'s brother , who lives with his sister . He flirts with Christine at different social gatherings . Claudia Fern : The Fern sister who reprimands Rhoda for harassing Claude the day of the picnic . She describes the events the day of the picnic to Christine along with her two other sisters . She informs Christine that Rhoda will not be welcome to attend their school the following term . Octavia Fern : Fern sister who explains to Christine why the sisters did not ask the Penmarks to donate money for a flower arrangement to be presented at Claude \\'s funeral . Burgess Fern : Fern sister in charge of enrollment at the Fern School . She would not hold the penmanship medal for Claude Daigle on the fateful day of the school picnic . Richard Bravo : Christine \\'s adopted father , who was killed in an airplane crash during World War II . He was a well-known columnist and war correspondent , performing great research in the \" Bessie Denker \" case . He never told Christine she was adopted or that Bessie Denker was her biological mother . Hortense Daigle : Mother of Claude Daigle . A plain , large woman who believes that the Fern sisters look down on her for being a hairdresser and marrying late in life , she is devastated by her son \\'s death and turns to alcohol as a source of comfort . She senses that Rhoda knows something about or had something to do with her son \\'s death and seeks her out twice to cajole answers . Dwight Daigle : Father of Claude Daigle . He tries to help his anguished wife and keep her under control as she suffers from the death of their son . The character \\'s forename was changed from Dwight in the novel to Henry for the 1956 play and film , and to Fred for the 1985 television adaptation . Mrs . Forsythe : An elderly woman who , towards the end of the novel , baby-sits Rhoda . Rhoda never harms Mrs . Forsythe because she does not have anything Rhoda wants . Belle Blackwell : Teacher of the Sunday school Rhoda attends who gives Rhoda a copy of Elsie Dinsmore . Clara Post : The elderly woman who lived with the Penmarks and her daughter , Edna , in the same apartment house in Wichita , Kansas . She befriended Rhoda and believed her to be truly delightful . She promised Rhoda that when she died Rhoda could have an item . Her widowed daughter , Edna , lived with her mother in the same apartment house in Wichita , Kansas as the Penmarks . Her mother died the day Edna left to go to the supermarket . Edna was skeptical of Rhoda \\'s story about her mother \\'s death and did not invite the Penmarks to the funeral or speak to them after the incident . Primary theme Nature versus nurture In the decade the novel was published , juvenile delinquency began to be far more common , or at least more extensively reported and documented . Compared to earlier history , the idea of child crimes was a new phenomenon . A controversy about nature and nurture arose as psychiatric explanations were proposed for juvenile delinquency , with the debate being whether inborn tendencies ( \" nature \" ) are more or less important than environmental factors ( \" nurture \" ) in explaining deviant behavior . Supporters of the “ nature ” side suggested that some people are born evil or with malicious tendencies . The idea that nature prevails over nurture is implied in The Bad Seed . March incorporates the notion that a murderous genetic trait is being passed down through the generations . Within the plot of the story , Rhoda is a serial murderer just like her grandmother , having inherited the murderous gene . Rhoda had been brought up as a privileged child ; she was nurtured emotionally and physically and thus a broken home life was not to blame for her actions . Tasker hints and suggests at the idea of nature taking effect when he quotes that \" some people are just born evil \" , when discussing Denker with Christine . Psychologist Robert D . Hare , who argues that the evidence suggests psychopathy is an inborn trait , discusses The Bad Seed in his 1993 non-fiction book Without Conscience . A lengthy quote from the novel opens Hare \\'s book , describing in March \\'s words how most decent individuals are not by nature suspicious and thus unable to understand or anticipate the acts of evil and depravity that some people are capable of committing . Later in his book , Hare argues that March \\'s novel is a \" remarkably true to life \" portrayal of the development of psychopathy in childhood , illustrating both Rhoda \\'s callous use of others to serve her own ends as well as Christine \\'s growing helplessness and desperation as she realizes the extent of her daughter \\'s behavior . Reviews James Kelly , New York Times : \" Let it be said quickly : William March knows where human fears and secrets are buried . He announced it in Company K , a novel published twenty years ago and equaled only by Dos Passos \\' Three Soldiers as a sampling of men at war . He has proved it again and again in the other novels and short stories , all of them floored and walled in what Clifton Fadiman decided to call \" Psychological acumen \" . But nowhere is this gift better displayed than in The Bad Seed — the portrayal of a coldly evil , murderous child and what she does to both victims and family . In the author \\'s hands this is adequate material for an absolutely first class novel of moral bewilderments and responsibilities nearest the heart of our decade . \" Dan Wickenden , New York Herald Tribune : \" Dark , original , ultimately appalling , William March \\'s extraordinary new novel is , on the obvious level , a straightforward , technically accomplished story of suspense . The manner of its telling — the dispassionate , exact , almost starched prose , with its occasional glints of sardonic humor — is an impressive achievement in itself . It lends some credibility to a narrative against which the imagination rebels ; and towards the end , as horror is piled upon horror , it saves the book from falling headlong into absurdity ... This is a novel bound to arouse strong responses , to generate vehement discussion , and so not easily to be forgotten . \" August Derleth , Chicago Sunday Tribune : \" The Bad Seed would have been a stronger novel without this false premise — the granddaughter of a murderess is no more likely to be a murderess than the granddaughter of a seamstress , or anyone else . Apart from this flaw , however , The Bad Seed is a novel of suspense and mounting horror , which the reader who can close his eyes to March \\'s unnecessary premise will enjoy as the work of one of the most satisfying of American novelists . \" L.A.G . Strong , The Spectator ( UK ) : \" The Bad Seed is terrifyingly good , not only because its theme is worked out so powerfully , but because every character is convincing . One has to believe that these appalling things took place exactly as the author says they did . \" Adaptations Broadway play Maxwell Anderson adapted the book for the stage almost immediately after its publication . Anderson had previously won the New York Drama Critics \\' Circle Award in 1935 and 1936 for his plays Winterset and High Tor , as well as the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1933 for his play Both Your Houses . Reginald Denham directed the play using Anderson \\'s script . The play opened on Broadway on December 8 , 1954 at the 46th Street Theatre ( now the Richard Rodgers Theatre ) , less than a year after the publication of the novel . On April 25 , 1955 , the play transferred to the Coronet Theatre ( now the Eugene O\\'Neill Theatre ) , where it completed its successful run of 334 performances on September 27 , 1955 . Nancy Kelly , the actress who played Christine , won the 1955 Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play . The audience made claims that Patty McCormack , the child actress who played Rhoda , was the most memorable character . 1956 film Mervyn LeRoy was the director of the 1956 movie . In LeRoy \\'s Hollywood career , he produced and or directed over 70 films including Little Caesar and Little Women . Nancy Kelly , Patty McCormack and most of the original cast acted in the 1956 movie . The ending of the 1956 film was changed from that of the novel and the play to comply with the Hollywood Production Code . Rhoda is suddenly struck and killed by lightning when she goes back to the scene of her crime to retrieve the medal ( allowing an interpretation of divine intervention ) , while Christine survives her suicide attempt . During the closing credits , LeRoy added a light-hearted sequence of Nancy Kelly , Christine , holding Patty McCormack , Rhoda , over her leg and spanking her — possibly to remind audiences that this is just a play . 1985 film The Bad Seed was remade as a television movie in 1985 , adapted by George Eckstein and directed by Paul Wendkos and kept the novel \\'s original ending but changed other details , including some forenames ( i.e . Claude Daigle → Mark Daigle , Hortense Daigle → Rita Daigle , Claudia Fern → Alice Fern ) and added a scene in which young Christine escapes into a cornfield from her own sociopathic mother , Bessie Denker . This version starred Blair Brown as Christine , Lynn Redgrave as Monica , David Ogden Stiers as Emory ( whose character is hinted to be a closeted homosexual ) , David Carradine as Leroy , and Chad Allen as Mark Daigle ( whose character was never seen before , only referenced ) . Carrie Wells played the title character , whose name was changed from Rhoda to Rachel . The TV-movie version was considered inferior to both the play and original film by critics . 2018 film In December 2017 , Deadline Hollywood reported that Rob Lowe would direct and star in a television remake for the Lifetime network . This version of The Bad Seed first ran on Lifetime on September 9 , 2018 , and was watched by 1.87 million viewers , placing it in the top ten most-watched cable programs on that date . However , the production received mixed reviews . \" Potential remake Eli Roth was set to direct a new remake of the film , as stated by MovieWeb.com . Roth promised a new take with a modern horror sensibility . \" The original was a great psychological thriller , and we are going to bastardize and exploit it , ramping up the body counts and killings , \" said Roth . \" This is going to be scary , bloody fun , and we \\'re going to create the next horror icon , a la Freddy , Jason and Chucky . She \\'s this cute , cunning , adorable kid who loves to kill , but also loves \\'N Sync . \" Bibliography Works cited External links The National Book Foundation \\'s List of 1955 finalists . Novels by William March American horror novels 1954 American novels Psychological novels American novels adapted into films American novels adapted into plays Murder–suicide in fiction Novels about sociopathy', 'Lakshmi ( ; , ) , also known as Shri ( , ) , is one of the principal goddesses in Hinduism . She is the goddess of wealth , fortune , power , beauty and prosperity , and associated with Maya ( \" Illusion \" ) . Along with Parvati and Saraswati , she forms the Tridevi of Hindu goddesses . Within the Goddess-oriented Shaktism , Lakshmi is venerated as a principle aspect of the Mother goddess . Lakshmi is both the wife and divine energy ( shakti ) of the Hindu god Vishnu , the Supreme Being of Vaishnavism ; she is also the Supreme Goddess in the sect and assists Vishnu to create , protect and transform the universe . Whenever Vishnu descended on the earth as an avatar , Lakshmi accompanied him as consort , for example as Sita and Radha or Rukmini as consorts of Vishnu \\'s avatars Rama and Krishna respectively . The eight prominent manifestations of Lakshmi , the Ashtalakshmi symbolize the eight sources of wealth . Lakshmi is depicted in Indian art as an elegantly dressed , prosperity-showering golden-coloured woman standing or siting in padmasana on a lotus throne , while holding a lotus in her hand , symbolizing fortune , self-knowledge , and spiritual liberation . Her iconography shows her with four hands , which represent the four aspects of human life important to Hindu culture : dharma , kāma , artha , and moksha . Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana , Lakshmi Tantra , Markandeya Purana , Devi Mahatmya and vedic scriptures describes Lakshmi as having eight or eighteen hands and as sitting on Garuda , Lion or Tiger . Archaeological discoveries and ancient coins suggest the recognition and reverence for Lakshmi existing by the 1st millennium BCE . Lakshmi \\'s iconography and statues have also been found in Hindu temples throughout Southeast Asia , estimated to be from the second half of the 1st millennium CE . The festivals of Diwali and Sharad Purnima ( Kojagiri Purnima ) are celebrated in her honor . Etymology and epithets Lakshmi in Sanskrit is derived from the root word lakṣ ( ) and lakṣa ( ) , meaning \\'to perceive , observe , know , understand \\' and \\'goal , aim , objective \\' , respectively . These roots give Lakshmi the symbolism : know and understand your goal . A related term is lakṣaṇa , which means \\'sign , target , aim , symbol , attribute , quality , lucky mark , auspicious opportunity \\' . Lakshmi has numerous epithets and numerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite her various names : such as Sri ( Radiance , eminence , splendor , wealth ) , Padmā ( she who is mounted upon or dwelling in a lotus or She of the lotus ) , Kamalā or Kamalatmika ( She of the lotus ) , Padmapriyā ( Lotus-lover ) , Padmamālādhāra Devī ( Goddess bearing a garland of lotuses ) , Padmamukhī ( Lotus-faced-she whose face is as like as a lotus ) , Padmākṣī : ( Lotus-eyed - she whose eyes are as beautiful as a lotus ) , Padmahasta : ( Lotus-hand - she whose hand is holding [ a ] lotus [ es ] ) , Padmasundarī ( She who is as beautiful as a lotus ) , Śrījā ( Jatika of Sri ) , Narayani ( belonging to Narayana or the wife of Narayana ) , Vaishnavi ( worshipper of Vishnu or the power of Vishnu ) , Viṣṇupriyā ( who is the beloved of Vishnu ) , Nandika ( the one who gives pleasure ) . Other than these Vaishnavas also consider Lalita , who is praised with 1,000 names in Lalita Sahasranama as Lakshmi .

Symbolism and iconography Lakshmi is a member of the Tridevi , the triad of great goddesses . She represents the Rajas guna , and the Iccha-shakti . The image , icons , and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism . Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective . Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism : dharma ( pursuit of ethical , moral life ) , artha ( pursuit of wealth , means of life ) , kama ( pursuit of love , emotional fulfillment ) , and moksha ( pursuit of self-knowledge , liberation ) .Parasarthy , A . 1983 . Symbolism in Hinduism . Chinmaya Mission Publication . . pp . 57–59 . In Lakshmi \\'s iconography , she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands . The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions . It symbolizes knowledge , self-realization , and liberation in the Vedic context , and represents reality , consciousness , and karma ( \\'work , deed \\' ) in the Tantra ( Sahasrara ) context . The lotus , a flower that blooms in clean or dirty water , also symbolizes purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows . It is a reminder that good and prosperity can bloom and not be affected by evil in one \\'s surroundings.Gibson , Lynne . 2002 . Hinduism . Heinemann . . p . 29 . Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana , Lakshmi Tantra , Markandeya Purana , Devi Mahatmya and Vedic scriptures describes Lakshmi as having eighteen hands and is described as holding rosary , axe , mace , arrow , thunderbolt , lotus , pitcher , rod , Sakti , Sword , Shield , Conch , bell , wine-cup , trident , noose and the discus in her eighteen hands . Below , behind , or on the sides , Lakshmi is very often shown with one or two elephants , known as Gajalakshmi , and occasionally with an owl . Elephants symbolize work , activity , and strength , as well as water , rain and fertility for abundant prosperity . The owl signifies the patient striving to observe , see , and discover knowledge , particularly when surrounded by darkness . As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight , the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth have been acquired . According to historian D . D . Kosambi , most of the Imperial Gupta kings were Vaishnavas and held the goddess Lakshmi in the highest esteem . Goddess Lakshmi is Simhavahini ( mount as lion ) on most of the coins during their rule . Coins during the rule of Prakashadiya , a Gupta ruler , contain the Garudadhvaja on the obverse and Lakshmi on the reverse . The Gupta period sculpture only used to associate lions with Lakshmi but was later attributed to Durga or a combined form of both goddesses . Lions are also associated with Veera Lakshmi , who is one of the Ashtalakshmi . Historian B . C . Bhattacharya says , \" An image of Gajalakshmi is found with two lions — one on either side of her . Two elephants are also shown near her head and by this we can say that Lion is also the vahana of Lakshmi along with Garuda \" . In some representations , wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money . This symbolism has a dual meaning : wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both materials as well as spiritual wealth . Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signifies compassion , giving or dāna ( \\'charity \\' ) . Lakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads , which symbolizes fortune and wealth . She , goddess of wealth and prosperity , is often represented with her husband Vishnu , the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace . This symbolism implies wealth and prosperity are coupled with the maintenance of life , justice , and peace . In Japan , where Lakshmi is known as Kisshōten , she is commonly depicted with the Nyoihōju gem ( 如意宝珠 ) in her hand . In Hindu literature Vedas and Brahmanas The meaning and significance of Lakshmi evolved in ancient Sanskrit texts . Lakshmi is mentioned once in Rigveda , in which the name is used to mean \\'kindred mark , sign of auspicious fortune\\'.In Atharva Veda , transcribed about 1000 BCE , Lakshmi evolves into a complex concept with plural manifestations . Book 7 , Chapter 115 of Atharva Veda describes the plurality , asserting that a hundred Lakshmis are born with the body of a mortal at birth , some good , Punya ( \\'virtuous \\' ) and auspicious , while others bad , paapi ( \\'evil \\' ) and unfortunate . The good are welcomed , while the bad urged to leave . The concept and spirit of Lakshmi and her association with fortune and the good is significant enough that Atharva Veda mentions it in multiple books : for example , in Book 12 , Chapter 5 as Punya Lakshmi . In some chapters of Atharva Veda , Lakshmi connotes the good , an auspicious sign , good luck , good fortune , prosperity , success , and happiness . Later , Lakshmi is referred to as the goddess of fortune , identified with Sri and regarded as the wife of ( ) . For example , in Shatapatha Brahmana , variously estimated to be composed between 800 BCE and 300 BCE , Sri ( Lakshmi ) is part of one of many theories , in ancient India , about the creation of the universe . In Book 9 of Shatapatha Brahmana , Sri emerges from Prajapati , after his intense meditation on the creation of life and nature of the universe . Sri is described as a resplendent and trembling woman at her birth with immense energy and powers . The gods are bewitched , desire her , and immediately become covetous of her . The gods approach Prajapati and request permission to kill her and then take her powers , talents , and gifts . Prajapati refuses , tells the gods that men should not kill women and that they can seek her gifts without violence . The gods then approach Lakshmi . Agni gets food , Soma gets kingly authority , Varuna gets imperial authority , Mitra acquires martial energy , Indra gets force , Brihaspati gets priestly authority , Savitri acquires dominion , Pushan gets splendour , Saraswati takes nourishment and Tvashtri gets forms . The hymns of Shatapatha Brahmana thus describe Sri as a goddess born with and personifying a diverse range of talents and powers . According to another legend , she emerges during the creation of universe , floating over the water on the expanded petals of a lotus flower ; she is also variously regarded as wife of Dharma , mother of Kāma , sister or mother of and , wife of Dattatreya , one of the nine Shaktis of , a manifestation of as identified with in Bharatasrama and as Sita , wife of Rama.Williams , Monier . Religious Thought and Life in India , Part 1 ( 2nd ed . ) . . Epics In the Epics of Hinduism , such as in Mahabharata , Lakshmi personifies wealth , riches , happiness , loveliness , grace , charm , and splendor . In another Hindu legend about the creation of the universe as described in Ramayana , Lakshmi springs with other precious things from the foam of the ocean of milk when it is churned by the gods and demons for the recovery of . She appeared with a lotus in her hand and so she is also called Padmā . Sita , the female protagonist of the Ramayana and her husband , the god-king Rama are considered as avatars of Lakshmi and Vishnu , respectively . In the Mahabharata , Draupadi is described as an incarnation of Sri . However , other chapter of the epic states that Lakshmi took the incarnation of Rukmini , the chief-wife of the Hindu god Krishna . Upanishads Shakta Upanishads are dedicated to the Tridevi of goddesses—Lakshmi , Saraswati and Parvati . Saubhagyalakshmi Upanishad describes the qualities , characteristics , and powers of Lakshmi . In the second part of the Upanishad , the emphasis shifts to the use of yoga and transcendence from material craving to achieve spiritual knowledge and self-realization , the true wealth.Warrier , A . G . Krishna , trans . 1931 . Saubhagya Lakshmi Upanishad . Chennai : Theosophical Publishing House . . Saubhagya-Lakshmi Upanishad synonymously uses Sri to describe Lakshmi . Stotram and sutras Numerous ancient Stotram and Sutras of Hinduism recite hymns dedicated to Lakshmi . She is a major goddess in Puranas and Itihasa of Hinduism . In ancient scriptures of India , all women are declared to be embodiments of Lakshmi . For example : Ancient prayers dedicated to Lakshmi seek both material and spiritual wealth in prayers . Puranas Lakshmi features prominently in Puranas of Hinduism . Vishnu Purana , in particular , dedicates many sections to her and also refers to her as Sri . J . A . B . van Buitenen translates passages describing Lakshmi in Vishnu Purana : Sri , loyal to Vishnu , is the mother of the world . Vishnu is the meaning , Sri is the speech . She is the conduct , he the behavior . Vishnu is knowledge , she the insight . He is dharma , she the virtuous action . She is the earth , the earth \\'s upholder . She is contentment , he the satisfaction . She wishes , he is the desire . Sri is the sky , Vishnu the Self of everything . He is the Sun , she the light of the Sun . He is the ocean , she is the shore . Subhasita , Genomic and Didactic Literature Lakshmi , along with Parvati and Saraswati , is a subject of extensive Subhashita , genomic and didactic literature of India . Composed in the 1st millennium BCE through the 16th century CE , they are short poems , proverbs , couplets , or aphorisms in Sanskrit written in a precise meter . They sometimes take the form of a dialogue between Lakshmi and Vishnu or highlight the spiritual message in Vedas and ethical maxims from Hindu Epics through Lakshmi . An example Subhashita is Puranartha Samgraha , compiled by Vekataraya in South India , where Lakshmi and Vishnu discuss niti ( \\'right , moral conduct \\' ) and rajaniti ( \\'statesmanship \\' or \\'right governance \\' ) —covering in 30 chapters and ethical and moral questions about personal , social and political life . Manifestations and aspects Inside temples , Lakshmi is often shown together with Vishnu . In certain parts of India , Lakshmi plays a special role as the mediator between her husband Vishnu and his worldly devotees . When asking Vishnu for grace or forgiveness , the devotees often approach him through the intermediary presence of Lakshmi . She is also the personification of spiritual fulfillment . Lakshmi embodies the spiritual world , also known as Vaikuntha , the abode of Lakshmi and Vishnu ( collectively called Lakshmi Narayana ) . Lakshmi is the embodiment of the creative energy of Vishnu , and primordial Prakriti who creates the universe . According to Garuda Purana , Lakshmi is considered as Prakriti ( Mahalakshmi ) and is identified with three forms Sri , Bhu and Nila . The three forms consists of Satva ( \\'goodness \\' ) , rajas , and tamas ( \\'darkness \\' ) gunas , and assists Vishnu ( Purusha ) in creation , preservation and destruction of the entire universe . In the Lakshmi Tantra and Lakshmi Sahasranama of Skanda Purana , Lakshmi is given the status of the primordial goddess . According to these texts , Durga and the forms such Mahalakshmi , Mahakali and Mahasaraswati and all the Shaktis that came out of all gods such as Matrikas and Mahavidya are all various forms of Goddess Lakshmi . In Lakshmi Tantra , Lakshmi says to Indra that she got the name Durga after killing an asura named Durgama . Indologists and authors Chitralekha Singh and Prem Nath says , \" Narada Purana describes the powerful forms of Lakshmi as Durga , Mahakali , Bhadrakali , Chandi , Maheshwari , Mahalakshmi , Vaishnavi and Andreye \" . Lakshmi , Saraswati , and Parvati are typically conceptualized as distinct in most of India , but in states such as West Bengal and Odisha , they are regionally believed to be forms of Durga . In Hindu Bengali culture , Lakshmi , along with Saraswati , are seen as the daughters of Durga . They are worshipped during Durga Puja . In South India , Lakshmi is seen in two forms , Sridevi and Bhudevi , both at the sides of Venkateshwara , a form of Vishnu . Bhudevi is the representation and totality of the material world or energy , called the Apara Prakriti , or Mother Earth ; Sridevi is the spiritual world or energy called the Prakriti . According to Lakshmi Tantra , Nila Devi , one of the manifestations or incarnations of Lakshmi is the third wife of Vishnu . Each goddess of the triad is mentioned in Śrī Sūkta , Bhu Sūkta and Nila Sūkta , respectively . This threefold goddess can be found , for example , in Sri Bhu Neela Sahita Temple near Dwaraka Tirumala , Andhra Pradesh , and in Adinath Swami Temple in Tamil Nadu . In many parts of the region , Andal is considered as an incarnation of Lakshmi . Ashta Lakshmi ( Sanskrit : ) is a group of eight secondary manifestations of Lakshmi . The Ashta Lakshmi presides over eight sources of wealth and thus represents the eight powers of Shri Lakshmi . Temples dedicated to Ashta Lakshmi are found in Tamil Nadu , such as Ashtalakshmi Kovil near Chennai and many other states of India . Creation and legends Devas ( gods ) and asuras ( demons ) were both mortal at one time in Hinduism . Amrita , the divine nectar that grants immortality , could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ( \\'Ocean of Milk \\' ) . The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara . The samudra manthan commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other . Vishnu incarnated as Kurma , the tortoise , and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole . Vasuki , the great venom-spewing serpent-god , was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean . A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning . Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi . In some versions , she is said to be the daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea . In Garuda Purana , Linga Purana and Padma Purana , Lakshmi is said to have been born as the daughter of the divine sage Bhrigu and his wife Khyati and was named Bhargavi . According to Vishnu Purana , the universe was created when the devas and asuras churned the cosmic Kshirasagar . Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus , along with divine cow Kamadhenu , Varuni , Parijat tree , Apsaras , Chandra ( the moon ) , and Dhanvantari with Amrita ( \\'nectar of immortality \\' ) . When she appeared , she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras . She chose Devas \\' side and among thirty deities , she chose to be with Vishnu . Thereafter , in all three worlds , the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated . Worship Many Hindus worship Lakshmi on Diwali , the festival of lights . It is celebrated in autumn , typically October or November every year . The festival spiritually signifies the victory of light over darkness , knowledge over ignorance , good over evil and hope over despair . Before Diwali night , people clean , renovate and decorate their homes and offices . On Diwali night , Hindus dress up in new clothes or their best outfits , light up diyas ( lamps and candles ) inside and outside their home , and participate in family puja ( prayers ) typically to Lakshmi . After puja , fireworks follow , then a family feast including mithai ( sweets ) , and an exchange of gifts between family members and close friends . Diwali also marks a major shopping period , since Lakshmi connotes auspiciousness , wealth and prosperity . This festival dedicated to Lakshmi is considered by Hindus to be one of the most important and joyous festivals of the year . A very sacred day for the worship of Goddess Lakshmi falls on Chaitra Shukla Panchami , also called , Lakshmi Panchami , Shri Panchami , Kalpadi and Shri Vrata . As this worship is in the first week of the Hindu new year , by Hindu calendar , it is considered very auspicious . Gaja Lakshmi Puja is another autumn festival celebrated on Sharad Purnima in many parts of India on the full-moon day in the month of Ashvin ( October ) . Sharad Purnima , also called Kojaagari Purnima or Kuanr Purnima , is a harvest festival marking the end of monsoon season . There is a traditional celebration of the moon called the Kaumudi celebration , Kaumudi meaning moonlight . On Sharad Purnima night , goddess Lakshmi is thanked and worshipped for the harvests . Vaibhav Lakshmi Vrata is observed on Friday for prosperity . List of temples Some temples where Devi Lakshmi can be found include : In Maharashtra , as Ambabai or Mahalakshmi in Mahalakshmi Temple , Kolhapur ( Shakti peetha ) ; Mahalakshmi Temple , Dahanu ; and the Mahalakshmi Temple in Mumbai In Karnataka , as Mookambika in Mookambika Temple , Kollur ; and Lakshmi Devi Temple , Doddagaddavalli In Kerala , as Bhagavathi in Chottanikkara Temple In Andhra Pradesh , as Kanaka Mahalakshmi in Sri Kanaka Maha Lakshmi In Tamil Nadu , as Lakshmi Narayani in Golden Temple , Sripuram ; as Ashtalakshmi in Ashtalakshmi Temple , Chennai ; Thirunarayur Nambi Temple ; Andal temple , Srivilliputhur ; Azhagiya Manavala Perumal Temple ; and Pundarikakshan Perumal Temple In Madhya Pradesh , as Lakshmi in Lakshmi Temple , Khajuraho Hymns Countless hymns , prayers , shlokas , stotra , songs , and legends dedicated to Mahalakshmi are recited during the ritual worship of Lakshmi . These include : Sri Lalitha Sahasranamam Sri Mahalakshmi Ashtakam Sri Lakshmi Sahasaranama Stotra ( by Sanath kumara ) Sri Stuti ( by Sri Vedantha Desikar ) Sri Lakshmi Stuti ( by Indra ) Sri Kanakadhāra Stotram ( by Sri Adi Shankara ) Sri Chatussloki ( by Sri Yamunacharya ) Narayani Stuti Devi Mahatmyam Middle episode Argala Stotra Sri Lakshmi Sloka ( by Bhagavan Sri Hari Swamiji ) Sri Sukta , which is contained in the Vedas and includes Lakshmi Gayatri Mantra ( \" Om Shree Mahalakshmyai ca vidmahe Vishnu patnyai ca dheemahi tanno Lakshmi prachodayat , Om \" ) Lakshmi Gayatri mantra mentioned in Linga Purana ( 48.13 ) - \" Sammuddhrtayai vidmahe Vishnunaikena dhimahi | tan no Radha prachodaydt \" translated to \" we think about Lakshmi whom Vishnu himself supports , we meditate on her , then let Radha inspire us . \" Archaeology A representation of the goddess as Gaja Lakshmi or Lakshmi flanked by two elephants spraying her with water , is one of the most frequently found in archaeological sites . An ancient sculpture of Gaja Lakshmi ( from Sonkh site at Mathura ) dates to the pre-Kushan Empire era . Atranjikhera site in modern Uttar Pradesh has yielded terracotta plaque with images of Lakshmi dating to 2nd century BCE . Other archaeological sites with ancient Lakshmi terracotta figurines from the 1st millennium BCE include Vaisali , Sravasti , Kausambi , Campa , and Candraketugadh . The goddess Lakshmi is frequently found in ancient coins of various Hindu kingdoms from Afghanistan to India . Gaja Lakshmi has been found on coins of Scytho-Parthian kings Azes II and Azilises ; she also appears on Shunga Empire king Jyesthamitra era coins , both dating to 1st millennium BCE . Coins from 1st through 4th century CE found in various locations in India such as Ayodhya , Mathura , Ujjain , Sanchi , Bodh Gaya , Kanauj , all feature Lakshmi . Similarly , ancient Greco-Indian gems and seals with images of Lakshmi have been found , estimated to be from 1st-millennium BCE . A 1400-year-old rare granite sculpture of Lakshmi has been recovered at the Waghama village along Jehlum in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir . The Pompeii Lakshmi , a statuette supposedly thought to be of Lakshmi found in Pompeii , Italy , dates to before the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE . In other religions and cultures Jainism Lakshmi is also an important deity in Jainism and found in Jain temples . Some Jain temples also depict Sri Lakshmi as a goddess of artha ( \\'wealth \\' ) and kama ( \\'pleasure \\' ) . For example , she is exhibited with Vishnu in Parshvanatha Jain Temple at the Khajuraho Monuments of Madhya Pradesh , where she is shown pressed against Vishnu \\'s chest , while Vishnu cups a breast in his palm . The presence of Vishnu-Lakshmi iconography in a Jain temple built near the Hindu temples of Khajuraho , suggests the sharing and acceptance of Lakshmi across a spectrum of Indian religions . This commonality is reflected in the praise of Lakshmi found in the Jain text Kalpa Sūtra . Buddhism In Buddhism , Lakshmi has been viewed as a goddess of abundance and fortune , and is represented on the oldest surviving stupas and cave temples of Buddhism . In Buddhist sects of Tibet , Nepal , and Southeast Asia , Vasudhara mirrors the characteristics and attributes of the Hindu Goddess , with minor iconographic differences . In Chinese Buddhism , Lakshmi is referred to as either Gōngdétiān ( 功德天 , lit \" Meritorious god \" ) or Jíxiáng Tiānnǚ ( 吉祥天女 , lit \" Auspicious goddess \" ) and is the goddess of fortune and prosperity . She is regarded as the sister of Píshāméntiān ( 毗沙門天 ) , or Vaiśravaṇa , one of the Four Heavenly Kings . She is also regarded as one of the twenty-four protective deities , and her image is frequently enshrined in the Mahavira Hall of most Chinese Buddhist monasteries together with the other deities . Her mantra , the Sri Devi Dharani ( Chinese : 大吉祥天女咒 ; pinyin : Dà Jíxiáng Tiānnǚ Zhòu ) is classified as one of the Ten Small Mantras ( Chinese : 十小咒 ; pinyin : Shí xiǎo zhòu ) , which are a collection of dharanis that are commonly recited in Chinese Buddhist temples during morning liturgical services . In Japanese Buddhism , Lakshmi is known as Kishijoten ( ) and is also the goddess of fortune and prosperity . Like in China , Kishijoten is considered the sister of Bishamon ( , also known as Tamon or Bishamon-ten ) , who protects human life , fights evil , and brings good fortune . In ancient and medieval Japan , Kishijoten was the goddess worshiped for luck and prosperity , particularly on behalf of children . Kishijoten was also the guardian goddess of Geishas . In Tibetan Buddhism , Lakshmi is an important deity , especially in the Gelug School . She has both peaceful and wrathful forms ; the latter form is known as Palden Lhamo , Shri Devi Dudsol Dokam , or Kamadhatvishvari , and is the principal female protector of ( Gelug ) Tibetan Buddhism and of Lhasa , Tibet . While Lakshmi and Vaiśravaṇa are found in ancient Chinese and Japanese Buddhist literature , their roots have been traced to deities in Hinduism . Lakshmi is closely linked to Dewi Sri , who is worshipped in Bali as the goddess of fertility and agriculture . Incarnations Lakshmi is attributed with various incarnations , including the following : Sita Radha Gopis Rukmini Jambvati Satyabhama Kalindi Nagnajiti Mitravinda Lakshmana Bhadra Junior wives of Krishna Revati Padmavathi Notes See also Ashta Lakshmi Deepalakshmi Doddagaddavalli Mahalakshmi Temple , Kolhapur Hindu goddess Lakshmi Narayan Star of Lakshmi Tridevi References Bibliography Further reading ( in Sanskrit only ) Dilip Kododwala , , Lakshmi Puja and Thousand Names \" ( ) by Swami Satyananda Saraswati External links British Broadcasting Corporation – Lakshmi Kashmiri Overseas Association , Inc – Goddess Lakshmi Mother goddesses Female buddhas and supernatural beings Fortune goddesses Beauty goddesses Hindu goddesses Shaktism Commerce goddesses Consorts of Vishnu Harvest goddesses Abundance goddesses', 'Shame is Salman Rushdie \\'s third novel , published in 1983 .

The show was produced by DIC Productions L.P . and originally aired from 1994 to 1999 , on Saturday mornings during FOX \\'s Fox Kids Network block . Reruns aired on the Qubo television network from June 9 , 2012 ( alongside Animal Atlas ) to May 26 , 2018 . The series won a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children \\'s Animated Program in 1995 , and in the same year was spun-off into a Where in the World-styled video game entitled Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective . Its theme tune bears a close resemblance to the chorus \" Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder \" ( \" Sing Songs of the Great Pasha \" ) from Mozart \\'s opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail ( The Abduction from the Seraglio ) . History Production and broadcast ( 1994–1999 ) The script for every Earth episode had to meet the approval of Broderbund , which created and , at the time , owned the Carmen franchise . Their cause for concern was the level of the violence on other FOX children \\'s shows such as X-Men and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers . Broderbund did not require this of the creators of the World and Time game shows that aired on PBS , presumably since PBS , as the distributor of such shows as Sesame Street , had a long-standing reputation for non-violent educational children \\'s programming . The lead characters of Earth were featured in Carmen Sandiego Junior Detective , released in 1995 . The opening theme song for the show is \" Singt dem großen Bassa Lieder \" from Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart \\'s Die Entführung aus dem Serail , with new lyrics , pop instrumentation , and a backbeat . The Rainbow Animation Group ( later renamed Galaxy World , Inc. , not to be confused with the Italian studio Rainbow S.p.A. ) , and Han Yang Productions contributed some animation for this series .

Carmen Sandiego was forced to team up with Zack and Ivy to help capture him and send him back to prison . Mason Dixon – The henchman who betrayed V.I.L.E . in numerous ways in the episode \" Timing is Everything . \" It began in 1989 when Carmen and Mason were in Amsterdam to steal a Rembrandt painting . Mason was captured and sentenced to 7 years in prison , while Carmen escaped from the police . When Mason was released , Carmen began searching for a Civil War-era sofa in the Appomattox Courthouse . The caper failed , resulting in Carmen being furious with Mason . As retaliation , he stole Carmen \\'s time machine and went back to 1989 to change the outcome of the Rembrandt theft so Carmen would go to jail and he would go on to run V.I.L.E . as the world \\'s greatest thief . In this alternate reality , Carmen becomes Mason \\'s henchman and has low self-esteem because she \" almost always [ gets ] caught . \" Mason , with Carmen \\'s unwilling aid , began stealing a series of items that would change the outcome of the Civil War . Carmen helped Zack and Ivy recapture him and take back control over V.I.L.E. , making her the world \\'s greatest thief once more . His name is a play on the surveyors Mason and Dixon who drew the border between Maryland and Pennsylvania in the 1760s known as the Mason–Dixon line . Lee Jordan ( voiced by David Coburn ) – The only ACME agent to have \" officially \" captured Carmen Sandiego . He was perhaps the most accomplished of all of ACME \\'s employees and as such , had quite a conceited attitude about himself . He was often flirtatious with Ivy ( much to her disgust ) , who hated his arrogance . He went on hiatus from ACME for an indeterminate amount of time , during which his outlook on his career took a drastic turn . Embittered by his fame and the lack of challenge the concept of fighting crime , he quit working for ACME and helped Carmen Sandiego escape in order to train to be a V.I.L.E . agent . However , his impulsive and unscrupulous nature clashed greatly with Carmen Sandiego \\'s more refined , pacifistic approach and because of that , he was fired . Infuriated by this , he joined the ranks of former V.I.L.E . agents who sought to usurp Carmen Sandiego from her title as \" the world \\'s greatest thief . \" He was foiled twice in this endeavor , both by the combined efforts of ACME and Carmen Sandiego , but still remains hostile , violent and dangerous . Unlike Carmen Sandiego , he sees nothing against putting another person \\'s life in danger to further his own personal gain and has even abducted and used a hostage as blackmail to force Carmen Sandiego into working for him .

In pan-Indian traditions , a guru is more than a teacher : traditionally , the guru is a reverential figure to the disciple ( or shisya in Sanskrit , literally seeker [ of knowledge or truth ] ) or student , with the guru serving as a \" counselor , who helps mold values , shares experiential knowledge as much as literal knowledge , an exemplar in life , an inspirational source and who helps in the spiritual evolution of a student \" . Whatever language it is written in , Judith Simmer-Brown explains that a tantric spiritual text is often codified in an obscure twilight language so that it can not be understood by anyone without the verbal explanation of a qualified teacher , the guru . A guru is also one \\'s spiritual guide , who helps one to discover the same potentialities that the guru has already realized . The oldest references to the concept of guru are found in the earliest Vedic texts of Hinduism . The guru , and gurukula – a school run by guru , were an established tradition in India by the 1st millennium BCE , and these helped compose and transmit the various Vedas , the Upanishads , texts of various schools of Hindu philosophy , and post-Vedic Shastras ranging from spiritual knowledge to various arts . By about mid 1st millennium CE , archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggest numerous larger institutions of gurus existed in India , some near Hindu temples , where guru-shishya tradition helped preserve , create and transmit various fields of knowledge . These gurus led broad ranges of studies including Hindu scriptures , Buddhist texts , grammar , philosophy , martial arts , music and painting . The tradition of the guru is also found in Jainism , referring to a spiritual preceptor , a role typically served by a Jain ascetic . In Sikhism , the guru tradition has played a key role since its founding in the 15th century , its founder is referred to as Guru Nanak , and its scripture as Guru Granth Sahib . The guru concept has thrived in Vajrayāna Buddhism , where the tantric guru is considered a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated . Definition and etymology The word ( Sanskrit : ) , a noun , connotes \" teacher \" in Sanskrit , but in ancient Indian traditions it has contextual meanings with significance beyond what teacher means in English . The guru is more than someone who teaches specific type of knowledge , and includes in its scope someone who is also a \" counselor , a sort of parent of mind ( Citta ) and Self ( Atman ) , who helps mold values ( Yamas and Niyamas ) and experiential knowledge as much as specific knowledge , an exemplar in life , an inspirational source and who reveals the meaning of life . \" The word has the same meaning in other languages derived from or borrowing words from Sanskrit , such as Hindi , Marathi , Punjabi , Tamil , Telugu , Kannada , Malayalam , Odia , Bengali , Gujarati and Nepali . The Malayalam term Acharyan or Asan is derived from the Sanskrit word Acharya . As a noun the word means the imparter of knowledge ( jñāna ; also Pali : ñāna ) . As an adjective , it means \\'heavy , \\' or \\'weighty , \\' in the sense of \" heavy with knowledge , \" heavy with spiritual wisdom , \" heavy with spiritual weight , \" \" heavy with the good qualities of scriptures and realization , \" or \" heavy with a wealth of knowledge . \" The word has its roots in the Sanskrit gri ( to invoke , or to praise ) , and may have a connection to the word gur , meaning \\'to raise , lift up , or to make an effort \\' . Sanskrit guru is cognate with Latin gravis \\'heavy ; grave , weighty , serious \\' and Greek βαρύς barus \\'heavy \\' . All three derive from the Proto-Indo-European root * gʷerə- , specifically from the zero-grade form * gʷr̥ə- . Female equivalent of gurus are called gurvis . The wife of the guru is the guru patni or guru ma . The guru \\'s son is guru putra , while the guru \\'s daughter is the guru putri . Darkness and light A popular etymological theory considers the term \" guru \" to be based on the syllables gu ( ) and ru ( ) , which it claims stands for darkness and \" light that dispels it \" , respectively . The guru is seen as the one who \" dispels the darkness of ignorance . \" Reender Kranenborg disagrees , stating that darkness and light have nothing to do with the word guru . He describes this as a folk etymology . Joel Mlecko states , \" Gu means ignorance , and Ru means dispeller , \" with guru meaning the one who \" dispels ignorance , all kinds of ignorance \" , ranging from spiritual to skills such as dancing , music , sports and others . Karen Pechelis states that , in the popular parlance , the \" dispeller of darkness , one who points the way \" definition for guru is common in the Indian tradition . In Western Esotericism and the Science of Religion , Pierre Riffard makes a distinction between \" occult \" and \" scientific \" etymologies , citing as an example of the former the etymology of \\'guru \\' in which the derivation is presented as gu ( \" darkness \" ) and ru ( \\'to push away \\' ) ; the latter he exemplifies by \" guru \" with the meaning of \\'heavy \\' . In Hinduism The Guru is an ancient and central figure in the traditions of Hinduism . The ultimate liberation , contentment , freedom in the form of moksha and inner perfection is considered achievable in the Hindu belief by two means : with the help of guru , and with evolution through the process of karma including rebirth in some schools of Hindu philosophy . At an individual level in Hinduism , the Guru is many things , including being a teacher of skills , a counselor , one who helps in the birth of mind and realization of one \\'s Self ( Atma ) , who instills values and experiential knowledge , an exemplar , an inspiration and who helps guide a student \\'s ( śiṣya ) spiritual development . At a social and religious level , the Guru helps continue the religion and Hindu way of life . Guru thus has a historic , reverential and an important role in the Hindu culture . Scriptures The word Guru is mentioned in the earliest layer of Vedic texts . The hymn 4.5.6 of Rigveda , for example , states Joel Mlecko , describes the guru as , \" the source and inspirer of the knowledge of the Self , the essence of reality , \" for one who seeks . The Upanishads , that is the later layers of the Vedic text , mention guru . Chandogya Upanishad , in chapter 4.4 for example , declares that it is only through guru that one attains the knowledge that matters , the insights that lead to Self-knowledge . The Katha Upanisad , in verse 1.2.8 declares the guru as indispensable to the acquisition of knowledge . In chapter 3 of Taittiriya Upanishad , human knowledge is described as that which connects the teacher and the student through the medium of exposition , just like a child is the connecting link between the father and the mother through the medium of procreation . In the Taittiriya Upanishad , the guru then urges a student , states Mlecko , to \" struggle , discover and experience the Truth , which is the source , stay and end of the universe . \" The ancient tradition of reverence for the guru in Hindu scriptures is apparent in 6.23 of the Shvetashvatara Upanishad , which equates the need of reverence and devotion for guru to be the same as for god , The Bhagavad Gita is a dialogue where Krishna speaks to Arjuna of the role of a guru , and similarly emphasizes in verse 4.34 that those who know their subject well are eager for good students , and the student can learn from such a guru through reverence , service , effort and the process of inquiry . Capabilities , role and methods for helping a student The 8th century Hindu text Upadesasahasri of the Advaita Vedanta philosopher Adi Shankara discusses the role of the guru in assessing and guiding students . In Chapter 1 , he states that teacher is the pilot as the student walks in the journey of knowledge , he is the raft as the student rows . The text describes the need , role and characteristics of a teacher , as follows , Adi Shankara presents a series of examples wherein he asserts that the best way to guide a student is not to give immediate answers , but posit dialogue-driven questions that enable the student to discover and understand the answer . Gurukula and the guru-shishya tradition Traditionally , the Guru would live a simple married life , and accept shishya ( student , Sanskrit : शिष्य ) where he lived . A person would begin a life of study in the Gurukula ( the household of the Guru ) . The process of acceptance included proffering firewood and sometimes a gift to the guru , signifying that the student wants to live with , work and help the guru in maintaining the gurukul , and as an expression of a desire for education in return over several years . At the Gurukul , the working student would study the basic traditional vedic sciences and various practical skills-oriented sastras along with the religious texts contained within the Vedas and Upanishads . The education stage of a youth with a guru was referred to as Brahmacharya , and in some parts of India this followed the Upanayana or Vidyarambha rites of passage . The gurukul would be a hut in a forest , or it was , in some cases , a monastery , called a matha or ashram or sampradaya in different parts of India . These had a lineage of gurus , who would study and focus on certain schools of Hindu philosophy or trade , and these were known as guru-shishya parampara ( teacher-student tradition ) . This guru-driven tradition included arts such as sculpture , poetry and music . Inscriptions from 4th century CE suggest the existence of gurukuls around Hindu temples , called Ghatikas or Mathas , where the Vedas were studied . In south India , 9th century Vedic schools attached to Hindu temples were called Calai or Salai , and these provided free boarding and lodging to students and scholars . Archaeological and epigraphical evidence suggests that ancient and medieval era gurukuls near Hindu temples offered wide range of studies , ranging from Hindu scriptures to Buddhist texts , grammar , philosophy , martial arts , music and painting . The Guru ( teacher ) Shishya ( disciple ) parampara or guru parampara , occurs where the knowledge ( in any field ) is passed down through the succeeding generations . It is the traditional , residential form of education , where the Shishya remains and learns with his Guru as a family member . The fields of study in traditional guru-sisya parampara were diverse , ranging from Hindu philosophy , martial arts , music , dance to various Vedangas . Gender and caste The Hindu texts offer a conflicting view of whether access to guru and education was limited to men and to certain varna ( castes ) . The Vedas and the Upanishads never mention any restrictions based either on gender or on varna . The Yajurveda and Atharvaveda texts state that knowledge is for everyone , and offer examples of women and people from all segments of society who are guru and participated in vedic studies . The Upanishads assert that one \\'s birth does not determine one \\'s eligibility for spiritual knowledge , only one \\'s effort and sincerity matters . In theory , the early Dharma-sutras and Dharma-sastras , such as Paraskara Grhyasutra , Gautama Smriti and Yajnavalkya smriti , state all four varnas are eligible to all fields of knowledge ; while verses of Manusmriti state that Vedic study is available only to men of three varnas , unavailable to Shudra and women . In practice , state Stella Kramrisch and others , the guru tradition and availability of education extended to all segments of ancient and medieval society . Lise McKean states the guru concept has been prevalent over the range of class and caste backgrounds , and the disciples a guru attracts come from both genders and a range of classes and castes . During the bhakti movement of Hinduism , which started in about mid 1st millennium CE , the gurus included women and members of all varna . Attributes The Advayataraka Upanishad states that the true teacher is a master in the field of knowledge , well-versed in the Vedas , is free from envy , knows yoga , lives a simple life that of a yogi , has realized the knowledge of the Atman ( Self ) . Some scriptures and gurus have warned against false teachers , and have recommended that the spiritual seeker test the guru before accepting him . Swami Vivekananda said that there are many incompetent gurus , and that a true guru should understand the spirit of the scriptures , have a pure character and be free from sin , and should be selfless , without desire for money and fame . According to the Indologist Georg Feuerstein , in some traditions of Hinduism , when one reaches the state of Self-knowledge , one \\'s own Self becomes the guru . In Tantra , states Feuerstein , the guru is the \" ferry who leads one across the ocean of existence . \" A true guru guides and counsels a student \\'s spiritual development because , states Yoga-Bija , endless logic and grammar leads to confusion , and not contentment . However , various Hindu texts caution prudence and diligence in finding the right guru , and avoiding the wrong ones . For example , in Kula-Arnava text states the following guidance : A true guru is , asserts Kula-Arnava , one who lives the simple virtuous life he preaches , is stable and firm in his knowledge , master yogi with the knowledge of Self ( Atma Gyaan ) and Brahman ( ultimate reality ) . The guru is one who initiates , transmits , guides , illuminates , debates and corrects a student in the journey of knowledge and of self-realization . The attribute of the successful guru is to help make the disciple into another guru , one who transcends him , and becomes a guru unto himself , driven by inner spirituality and principles . In modern Hinduism In modern neo-Hinduism , Kranenborg states guru may refer to entirely different concepts , such as a spiritual advisor , or someone who performs traditional rituals outside a temple , or an enlightened master in the field of tantra or yoga or eastern arts who derives his authority from his experience , or a reference by a group of devotees of a sect to someone considered a god-like Avatar by the sect . The tradition of reverence for guru continues in several denominations within modern Hinduism , but rather than being considered as a prophet , the guru is seen as a person who points the way to spirituality , oneness of being , and meaning in life . In Buddhism In some forms of Buddhism , states Rita Gross , the concept of Guru is of supreme importance . Guru is called as Garu in Pali . The Guru is the teacher , who teaches the spiritual and religious knowledge . Guru can be anyone who teach this knowledge and not generally need to be Acariya or Upajjhaya . Guru can also be a personal teacher . Buddha is called as Lokagaru , meaning \" the teacher of the world \" . In Vajrayana Buddhism \\'s Tantric teachings , the rituals require the guidance of a guru . The guru is considered essential and to the Buddhist devotee , the guru is the \" enlightened teacher and ritual master \" , states Stephen Berkwitz . The guru is known as the vajra guru ( literally \" diamond guru \" ) . Initiations or ritual empowerments are necessary before the student is permitted to practice a particular tantra , in Vajrayana Buddhist sects found in Tibet and South Asia . The tantras state that the guru is equivalent to Buddha , states Berkwitz , and is a figure to worship and whose instructions should never be violated . There are Four Kinds of Lama ( Guru ) or spiritual teacher ( Tib . lama nampa shyi ) in Tibetan Buddhism : gangzak gyüpé lama — the individual teacher who is the holder of the lineage gyalwa ka yi lama — the teacher which is the word of the buddhas nangwa da yi lama — the symbolic teacher of all appearances rigpa dön gyi lama — the absolute teacher , which is rigpa , the true nature of mind In various Buddhist traditions , there are equivalent words for guru , which include Shastri ( teacher ) , Kalyana Mitra ( friendly guide , Pali : Kalyāṇa-mittatā ) , Acarya ( master ) , and Vajra-Acarya ( hierophant ) . The guru is literally understood as \" weighty \" , states Alex Wayman , and it refers to the Buddhist tendency to increase the weight of canons and scriptures with their spiritual studies . In Mahayana Buddhism , a term for Buddha is Bhaisajya guru , which refers to \" medicine guru \" , or \" a doctor who cures suffering with the medicine of his teachings \" . In Jainism Guru is the spiritual preceptor in Jainism , and typically a role served by Jain ascetics . The guru is one of three fundamental tattva ( categories ) , the other two being dharma ( teachings ) and deva ( divinity ) . The guru-tattva is what leads a lay person to the other two tattva . In some communities of the Śvētāmbara sect of Jainism , a traditional system of guru-disciple lineage exists . The guru is revered in Jainism ritually with Guru-vandan or Guru-upashti , where respect and offerings are made to the guru , and the guru sprinkles a small amount of vaskep ( a scented powder mixture of sandalwood , saffron , and camphor ) on the devotee \\'s head with a mantra or blessings . In Sikhism In Sikhism , Guru is the source of all knowledge which is Almighty . In Chopai Sahib , Guru Gobind Singh states about who is the Guru : The Sikh gurus were fundamental to the Sikh religion , however the concept in Sikhism differs from other usages . Sikhism is derived from the Sanskrit word shishya , or disciple and is all about the relationship between the teacher and a student . The concept of Guru in Sikhism stands on two pillars i.e . Miri-Piri . \\'Piri \\' means spiritual authority and \\'Miri \\' means temporal authority . Traditionally , the concept of Guru is considered central in Sikhism , and its main scripture is prefixed as a Guru , called Guru Granth Sahib , the words therein called Gurbani . In Western culture As an alternative to established religions in the West , some people in Europe and the US looked to spiritual guides and gurus from India and other countries . Gurus from many denominations traveled to Western Europe and the US and established followings . In particular during the 1960s and 1970s many gurus acquired groups of young followers in Western Europe and the US . According to the American sociologist David G . Bromley this was partially due to the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1965 which permitted Asian gurus entrance to the US . According to the Dutch Indologist Albertina Nugteren , the repeal was only one of several factors and a minor one compared with the two most important causes for the surge of all things \\'Eastern \\' : the post-war cross-cultural mobility and the general dissatisfaction with established Western values . In the Western world , the term is sometimes used in a derogatory way to refer to individuals who have allegedly exploited their followers \\' naiveté , particularly in certain cults or groups in the fields of hippie , new religious movements , self-help , and tantra . According to the professor in sociology Stephen A . Kent at the University of Alberta and Kranenborg ( 1974 ) , one of the reasons why in the 1970s young people including hippies turned to gurus was because they found that drugs had opened for them the existence of the transcendental or because they wanted to get high without drugs . According to Kent , another reason why this happened so often in the US then , was because some anti-Vietnam War protesters and political activists became worn out or disillusioned of the possibilities to change society through political means , and as an alternative turned to religious means . One example of such group was the Hare Krishna movement ( ISKCON ) founded by A.C . Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada in 1966 , many of whose followers voluntarily accepted the demanding lifestyle of bhakti yoga on a full-time basis , in stark contrast to much of the popular culture of the time . Some gurus and the groups they lead attracted opposition from the Anti-Cult Movement . According to Kranenborg ( 1984 ) , Jesus Christ fits the Hindu definition and characteristics of a guru . Environmental activists are sometimes called \" gurus \" or \" prophets \" for embodying a moral or spiritual authority and gathering followers . Examples of environmental gurus are John Muir , Henry David Thoreau , Aldo Leopold , George Perkins Marsh , and David Attenborough . Abidin et al . wrote that environmental gurus \" merge the boundaries \" between spiritual and scientific authority . Viewpoints Gurus and the Guru-shishya tradition have been criticized and assessed by secular scholars , theologians , anti-cultists , skeptics , and religious philosophers . Jiddu Krishnamurti , groomed to be a world spiritual teacher by the leadership of the Theosophical Society in the early part of the 20th century , publicly renounced this role in 1929 while also denouncing the concept of gurus , spiritual leaders , and teachers , advocating instead the unmediated and direct investigation of reality . U . G . Krishnamurti , [ no relation to Jiddu ] , sometimes characterized as a \" spiritual anarchist \" , denied both the value of gurus and the existence of any related worthwhile \" teaching \" . Dr . David C . Lane proposes a checklist consisting of seven points to assess gurus in his book , Exposing Cults : When the Skeptical Mind Confronts the Mystical . One of his points is that spiritual teachers should have high standards of moral conduct and that followers of gurus should interpret the behavior of a spiritual teacher by following Ockham \\'s razor and by using common sense , and , should not naively use mystical explanations unnecessarily to explain immoral behavior . Another point Lane makes is that the bigger the claim a guru makes , such as the claim to be God , the bigger the chance is that the guru is unreliable . Dr . Lane \\'s fifth point is that self-proclaimed gurus are likely to be more unreliable than gurus with a legitimate lineage . Highlighting what he sees as the difficulty in understanding the guru from Eastern tradition in Western society , Dr . Georg Feuerstein , a well-known German-American Indologist , writes in the article Understanding the Guru from his book The Deeper Dimension of Yoga : Theory and practice : \" The traditional role of the guru , or spiritual teacher , is not widely understood in the West , even by those professing to practice Yoga or some other Eastern tradition entailing discipleship . [ ... ] Spiritual teachers , by their very nature , swim against the stream of conventional values and pursuits . They are not interested in acquiring and accumulating material wealth or in competing in the marketplace , or in pleasing egos . They are not even about morality . Typically , their message is of a radical nature , asking that we live consciously , inspect our motives , transcend our egoic passions , overcome our intellectual blindness , live peacefully with our fellow humans , and , finally , realize the deepest core of human nature , the Spirit . For those wishing to devote their time and energy to the pursuit of conventional life , this kind of message is revolutionary , subversive , and profoundly disturbing \" . In his Encyclopedic Dictionary of Yoga ( 1990 ) , Dr . Feuerstein writes that the importation of yoga to the West has raised questions as to the appropriateness of spiritual discipleship and the legitimacy of spiritual authority . A British professor of psychiatry , Anthony Storr , states in his book , Feet of Clay : A Study of Gurus , that he confines the word guru ( translated by him as \" revered teacher \" ) to persons who have \" special knowledge \" who tell , referring to their special knowledge , how other people should lead their lives . He argues that gurus share common character traits ( e.g . being loners ) and that some suffer from a mild form of schizophrenia . He argues that gurus who are authoritarian , paranoid , eloquent , or who interfere in the private lives of their followers are the ones who are more likely to be unreliable and dangerous . Storr also refers to Eileen Barker \\'s checklist to recognize false gurus . He contends that some so-called gurus claim special spiritual insights based on personal revelation , offering new ways of spiritual development and paths to salvation . Storr \\'s criticism of gurus includes the possible risk that a guru may exploit his or her followers due to the authority that he or she may have over them , though Storr does acknowledge the existence of morally superior teachers who refrain from doing so . He holds the view that the idiosyncratic belief systems that some gurus promote were developed during a period of psychosis to make sense of their own minds and perceptions , and that these belief systems persist after the psychosis has gone . Storr notes that gurus generalize their experience to all people . Some of them believe that all humanity should accept their vision , while others teach that when the end of the world comes , only their followers will be saved , and the rest of the people will remain unredeemed . According to him , this ″apparently arrogant assumption″ is closely related and other characteristics of various gurus . Storr applies the term \" guru \" to figures as diverse as Jesus , Muhammad , Buddha , Gurdjieff , Rudolf Steiner , Carl Jung , Sigmund Freud , Jim Jones and David Koresh . The Belgian Indologist Koenraad Elst criticized Storr \\'s book for its avoidance of the term prophet instead of guru for several people . Elst asserts that this is possibly due to Storr \\'s pro-Western , pro-Christian cultural bias . Rob Preece , a psychotherapist and a practicing Buddhist , writes in The Noble Imperfection that while the teacher/disciple relationship can be an invaluable and fruitful experience , the process of relating to spiritual teachers also has its hazards . He writes that these potential hazards are the result of naiveté amongst Westerners as to the nature of the guru/devotee relationship , as well as a consequence of a lack of understanding on the part of Eastern teachers as to the nature of Western psychology . Preece introduces the notion of transference to explain the manner in which the guru/disciple relationship develops from a more Western psychological perspective . He writes : \" In its simplest sense transference occurs when unconsciously a person endows another with an attribute that actually is projected from within themselves . \" In developing this concept , Preece writes that , when we transfer an inner quality onto another person , we may be giving that person a power over us as a consequence of the projection , carrying the potential for great insight and inspiration , but also the potential for great danger : \" In giving this power over to someone else they have a certain hold and influence over us it is hard to resist , while we become enthralled or spellbound by the power of the archetype \" . According to a professor of religious studies at Dawson College in Quebec , Susan J . Palmer , the word guru has acquired very negative connotations in France . The psychiatrist Alexander Deutsch performed a long-term observation of a small cult , called The Family ( not to be confused with Family International ) , founded by an American guru called Baba or Jeff in New York in 1972 , who showed increasingly schizophrenic behavior . Deutsch observed that this man \\'s mostly Jewish followers interpreted the guru \\'s pathological mood swings as expressions of different Hindu deities and interpreted his behavior as holy madness , and his cruel deeds as punishments that they had earned . After the guru dissolved the cult in 1976 , his mental condition was confirmed by Jeff \\'s retrospective accounts to an author . Jan van der Lans ( 1933–2002 ) , a professor of the psychology of religion at the Catholic University of Nijmegen , wrote , in a book commissioned by the Netherlands-based Catholic Study Center for Mental Health , about followers of gurus and the potential dangers that exist when personal contact between the guru and the disciple is absent , such as an increased chance of idealization of the guru by the student ( myth making and deification ) , and an increase of the chance of false mysticism . He further argues that the deification of a guru is a traditional element of Eastern spirituality but , when detached from the Eastern cultural element and copied by Westerners , the distinction between the person who is the guru and that which he symbolizes is often lost , resulting in the relationship between the guru and disciple degenerating into a boundless , uncritical personality cult . In their 1993 book , The Guru Papers , authors Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer reject the guru-disciple tradition because of what they see as its structural defects . These defects include the authoritarian control of the guru over the disciple , which is in their view increased by the guru \\'s encouragement of surrender to him . Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus are likely to be hypocrites because , in order to attract and maintain followers , gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus . According to the journalist Sacha Kester , in a 2003 article in the Dutch newspaper De Volkskrant , finding a guru is a precarious matter , pointing to the many holy men in India and the case of Sathya Sai Baba whom Kester considers a swindler . In this article he also quotes the book Karma Cola describing that in this book a German economist tells author Gita Mehta , \" It is my opinion that quality control has to be introduced for gurus . Many of my friends have become crazy in India \" . She describes a comment by Suranya Chakraverti who said that some Westerners do not believe in spirituality and ridicule a true guru . Other westerners , Chakraverti said , on the other hand believe in spirituality but tend to put faith in a guru who is a swindler . Teachings of Shri Satguru Devendra Ghia ( Kaka ) are in his hymns and the broadness of his thoughts is in the variety . \" Religion is nothing but a path towards God . Different religions have evolved over different times and in different places based on the need of that era . However , the basic concept in each religion remains the same . Each religion talks of a universal God , who is eternal and infinite . \" See also Lineage Guru–shishya tradition Parampara Sampradaya Lineage ( Buddhism ) List of Hindu gurus Lifestyle Akhara Apprenticeship Chillum Darshan Gurukula Kaupinam Kacchera Langota Others Aghori Charismatic authority Godman Guru Gita Gurunath Hindu reform movements Lama Lifestyle guru Nath Religious conversion Sage ( philosophy ) Satguru ( Sadguru ) Shramana Sikh gurus Shifu Sensei Eight Garudhammas Vishwa Guru Notes References Further reading Mick Brown The Spiritual Tourist , Bloomsbury publishing , 1998 , André van der Braak ( 2003 ) .

The protagonist makes key decisions that affect the plot , primarily influencing the story and propelling it forward , and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles . If a story contains a subplot , or is a narrative made up of several stories , then each subplot may have its own protagonist . The protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience , and who is opposed by the antagonist . The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflicts that test the protagonist , and revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist \\'s character . Etymology The term protagonist comes from Ancient Greek ( , \\'actor who plays the chief or first part \\' ) , combined of , \\'first \\' ) and ( , \\'actor , competitor \\' ) , which stems from ( , \\'contest \\' ) via ( , \\' I contend for a prize \\' ) . Ancient Greece The earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in Ancient Greece . At first , dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus . Then in Poetics , Aristotle describes how a poet named Thespis introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engaging in a dialogue with the chorus . This was the invention of tragedy , and occurred about 536 B.C . Then the poet Aeschylus , in his plays , introduced a second actor , inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters . Sophocles then wrote plays that included a third actor . A description of the protagonist \\'s origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama , the protagonist served as the author , the director , and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later . There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as deuteragonist and tritagonist primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part . However , these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the deuteragonist ( second most important character ) should be on the right hand , and the tritagonist ( third most important character ) , the left . In Ancient Greece , the protagonist is distinguished from the term \" hero \" , which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being in the narrative . Types Hero/Heroine In literary terms , a hero ( masculine ) or heroine ( feminine ) protagonist is typically admired for their achievements and noble qualities . Heroes are lauded for their strength , courage , virtuousness , and honor , and are considered to be the \" good guys \" of the narrative . Examples include DC Comics \\' Superman ( hero ) and Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games ( heroine ) . Antihero An antihero ( sometimes spelled as anti-hero ) or antiheroine is a main character in a story who lacks conventional heroic qualities and attributes such as idealism , courage , and morality . Examples include Holden Caulfield from The Catcher in the Rye and Jay Gatsby from The Great Gatsby . Tragic hero A tragic hero is the protagonist of a tragedy . Examples include Oedipus from Oedipus Rex and Prince Hamlet from Shakespeare \\'s Hamlet . Villain protagonist The protagonist is not always conventionally good . Contrasting the hero protagonist , a villain protagonist is a protagonist who is a villain , driving the story forward regardless of the evil qualities the main character has . These traits can include being cruel , malicious , and wicked . Examples include Humbert Humbert in Vladimir Nabokov \\'s Lolita and Richard III in William Shakespeare \\'s eponymous play . Supporting protagonist When a supporting protagonist appears , the story is told from the perspective of a character who appears to be minor . This character may be more peripheral from the events of the story and are not as involved within the \" main action \" of the plot . The supporting protagonist may be telling the story while viewing another character as the main influence of the plot . Examples include Nick from The Great Gatsby and Bilbo Baggins from The Hobbit . Further examples Euripides \\' play Hippolytus may be considered to have two protagonists , though one at a time . Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half , who dies partway through the play . Her stepson , the titular Hippolytus , assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play . In Henrik Ibsen \\'s play The Master Builder , the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness . The young woman , Hilda Wangel , whose actions lead to the death of Solness , is the antagonist . In Shakespeare \\'s play Romeo and Juliet , Romeo is the protagonist . He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet , and the audience is invested in that story . Tybalt , as an antagonist , opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship . In Shakespeare \\'s play Hamlet , Prince Hamlet , who seeks revenge for the murder of his father , is the protagonist . The antagonist is the character who most opposes Hamlet , Claudius ( though , in many ways , Hamlet is his own antagonist ) . Sometimes , a work will have a false protagonist , who may seem to be the protagonist , but then may disappear unexpectedly . The character Marion in Alfred Hitchcock \\'s film Psycho ( 1960 ) is an example . A novel may contain a number of narratives , each with its own protagonist . Alexander Solzhenitsyn \\'s The First Circle , for example , depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a gulag camp . Leo Tolstoy \\'s War and Peace depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war . Though many people equate protagonists with the term hero and possessing heroic qualities , it is not necessary , as even villainous characters can be protagonists . Examples include Michael Corleone from The Godfather ( 1972–1990 ) film series ( 1978–1983 ) , Tony Montana from Scarface ( 1983 ) , Light Yagami from the Death Note manga series , Gabriel Belmont from Castlevania : Lords of Shadow , Patrick Bateman from American Psycho ( 2000 ) , Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars : Episode III – Revenge of the Sith ( 2005 ) , Dexter Morgan from the TV series Dexter , and Arthur Fleck/Joker from Joker ( 2019 ) . In some cases , the protagonist is not a human : in Richard Adams \\' novel Watership Down , a group of anthropomorphised rabbits , led by the protagonist Hazel , escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction , starting a perilous journey to find a new home . References Ancient Greek theatre Psychodrama', 'In public relations and communication science , publics are groups of individual people , and the public ( a.k.a . the general public ) is the totality of such groupings . This is a different concept to the sociological concept of the Öffentlichkeit or public sphere . The concept of a public has also been defined in political science , psychology , marketing , and advertising . In public relations and communication science , it is one of the more ambiguous concepts in the field . Although it has definitions in the theory of the field that have been formulated from the early 20th century onwards , and suffered more recent years from being blurred , as a result of conflation of the idea of a public with the notions of audience , market segment , community , constituency , and stakeholder . Etymology and definitions The name \" public \" originates with the Latin publicus ( also poplicus ) , from populus , to the English word \\'populace \\' , and in general denotes some mass population ( \" the people \" ) in association with some matter of common interest . So in political science and history , a public is a population of individuals in association with civic affairs , or affairs of office or state . In social psychology , marketing , and public relations , a public has a more situational definition . John Dewey defined public as a group of people who , in facing a similar problem , recognize it and organize themselves to address it . Dewey \\'s definition of a public is thus situational : people organized about a situation . Built upon this situational definition of a public is the situational theory of publics by James E . Grunig , which talks of nonpublics ( who have no problem ) , latent publics ( who have a problem ) , aware publics ( who recognize that they have a problem ) , and active publics ( who do something about their problem ) . In public relations and communication theory , a public is distinct from a stakeholder or a market . A public is a subset of the set of stakeholders for an organization , that comprises those people concerned with a specific issue . Whilst a market has an exchange relationship with an organization , and is usually a passive entity that is created by the organization , a public does not necessarily have an exchange relationship , and is both self-creating and self-organizing . Publics are targeted by public relations efforts . In this , target publics are those publics whose involvement is necessary for achieving organization goals ; intervening publics are opinion formers and mediators , who pass information to the target publics ; and influentials are publics that the target publics turn to for consultation , whose value judgements are influential upon how a target public will judge any public relations material . The public is often targeted especially in regard to political agendas as their vote is necessary in order to further the progression of the cause . As seen in Massachusetts between 2003 and 2004 , it was necessary to \" win a critical mass of states and a critical mass of public support \" in order to get same-sex marriage passed in the commonwealth . Public relations theory perspectives on publics are situational , per Dewey and Grunig ; mass , where a public is simply viewed as a population of individuals ; agenda-building , where a public is viewed as a condition of political involvement that is not transitory ; and \" homo narrans \" , where a public is ( in the words of Gabriel M . Vasquez , assistant professor in the School of Communication at the University of Houston ) a collection of \" individuals that develop a group consciousness around a problematic situation and act to solve the problematic situation \" . Public schools are often under controversy for their \" agenda-building , \" especially in debates over whether to teach a religious or secular curriculum . The promotion of an agenda is commonplace whenever one is in a public environment , but schools have exceptional power in that regard . In the public school system , it is the responsibility of those within the system to determine what agenda is being promoted . One non-situational concept of a public is that of Kirk Hallahan , professor at Colorado State University , who defines a public as \" a group of people who relate to an organization , who demonstrate varying degrees of activity—passivity , and who might ( or might not ) interact with others concerning their relationship with the organization \" . Samuel Mateus \\'s 2011 paper \" Public as Social Experience \" considered to view the concept by an alternative point of view : the public \" is neither a simple audience constituted by media consumers nor just a rational-critical agency of a Public Sphere \" . He argued \" the concept should also be seen in the light of a publicness principle , beyond a critic and manipulative publicity ( ... ) . In accordance , the public may be regarded as the result of the social activities made by individuals sharing symbolic representations and common emotions in publicness . Seen with lower-case , the concept is a set of subjectivities who look publicly for a feeling of belonging . So , in this perspective , the public is still a fundamental notion to social life although in a different manner in comparison to 18th century Public Sphere \\'s Public . He means above all the social textures and configurations where successive layers of social experience are built up . \" The general public also sets social norms which causes people to express themselves in socially acceptable manners . Although this is present within every community , this is often especially applicable within the transgender community as they feel the need to \" perform \" to a certain set of expectations to be seen as their true gender . Social publics Social publics are groups of people united by common ideas , ideology , or hobbies . Networked publics are social publics which have been socially restructured by the networking of technologies . As such , they are simultaneously both ( 1 ) the space constructed through networked technologies and ( 2 ) the imagined collective which consequently emerges as a result of the intersection of human persons , shared technologies , and their practices .

His mother , Fatima Umm Abdallah , was the daughter of Hasan ibn Ali , making him the first Imam descended from both grandsons of Muhammad : Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali . in Naqshbandi order , he is revered as the father of Ja\\'far al-Sadiq , the sheikh of the Golden Chain . Muhammad al-Baqir was born in Medina , about the time when Muawiyah was trying to take the oath of allegiance for his son , Yazid . As a child , al-Baqir witnessed the Tragedy of Karbala , in which all his male relatives , except his father who was ill , were killed . As a young man , Baqir was observing the struggle of power between the Umayyads , Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and various Shia sects ; meanwhile , al-Baqir observed how his father preferred to resign from political issues . Al-Baqir is revered by both Shiite Muslims and Sunni Muslims for his religious leadership , and respected for his knowledge and Islamic scholarship as a jurist in Medina . Al-Baqir lived in the city his entire life , though most of his disciples lived in Kufa , Iraq . Like his father , he tried not to be engaged in the conflicts fueled against the Umayyad Caliphs , and even tried to convince his half-brother , Zayd ibn Ali , not to engage in conflicts . Al-Baqir spent his time elaborating the theory of Imamate . According to Arzina R . Lalani , he laid the foundation of Imami Shi\\'ism , which was elaborated later by his son and successor , Ja\\'far al-Sadiq . Ancestry Al-Baqir descended from a prominent lineage . His father was Ali ibn Husayn , known also with the honorific title Zayn al-Abidin , and his paternal grandfather was Husayn ibn Ali , while his mother was Fatimah Umm Abd Allah , and his maternal grandfather was Hasan ibn Ali . His grandfathers , Hasan and Husayn , were the two eldest surviving sons of Ali through his first wife , Fatimah , daughter of the Islamic prophet , Muhammad . Name The honorific title al-Baqir is an abbreviation of Baqir al-\\'ilm , which means either \\'the one who splits knowledge open \\' ( brings it to light ) or \\'the one who possesses great knowledge \\' . According to Ibn Khallikan , Muhammad ibn Ali received the honorific title al-Baqir ( ) because of the ample fund of knowledge he possessed . Ya\\'qubi , however , writes that he received this title because he split knowledge open by scrutinizing and examining its depths . In Shia belief , the title Baqir al-\\'ilm was given to Muhammad ibn Ali by the Islamic prophet , Muhammad . Al-Kulayni writes that the prophet \\'s only surviving companion , Jabir ibn Abd Allah , commonly addressed Muhammad ibn Ali as \" O Baqir al-\\'ilm , \" telling the Medinans about Muhammad \\'s prophesy , \" O Jabir ! You will meet a man from my family who will have the same name and the same characteristics as mine . He will split open knowledge extensively . \" According to al-Kulayni , Jabir ibn Abd Allah first met Muhammad ibn Ali when the latter was still a child . Abd Allah identified the boy from the features Muhammad had described and then uttered with delight , \" Characteristics of the Messenger of Allah , by Him in whose hands is my soul ! O boy , what is your name ? \" When Muhammad ibn Ali introduced himself , Jabir approached him , kissed his forehead and gave Muhammad \\'s regards . Another Shia account relates that Caliph Hisham met with al-Baqir \\'s half brother , Zayd , and rudely referred to him as ( ) . Zayd replied that it was the prophet Muhammad who had given his brother the title al-Baqir and that , by ridiculing al-Baqir , the caliph had ridiculed Muhammad . This narration suggests , according to Lalani , that al-Baqir was known by this title before he was born . Biography Birth and early life Al-Baqir was born in Medina around 56 AH ( 676 AD ) when Muawiyah I was trying to ensure that his son Yazid I could inherit the caliphate . When Al-Baqir was a child , his family was affected by the Battle of Karbala ; he was three or four years old when his grandfather , Husayn , was killed . According to Ya\\'qubi , al-Baqir was present at Karbala . In his youth he witnessed the struggle for power among the Umayyads , Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr and a number of Shiite parties , whilst his father maintained a distance from local political activity . Under the Umayyad caliphs Despite his non-involvement in political activities , the Umayyad rulers harassed Muhammad al-Baqir . Many Shia individuals and delegations came to Medina from Kufa to hear al-Baqir \\'s teachings and ask him questions , among which was who had the right to rule . He was also distrusted because of the uprising of his brother Zayd ibn Ali and other relatives . Abd al-Malik \\'s reign It is said that Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan consulted Muhammad al-Baqir about the threatening letters he received from Roman emperor . It was because Abd al-Malik forbade the papers and clothes with Christian motto ( the Father , the Son ( Jesus Christ ) , and the Holy Spirit ) on them . Roman emperor wrote to Abd al-Malik , threatening him that he should change his mind , otherwise he ( Roman emperor ) would engrave insulting words to Muhammad on the coins engraved in Roman empire . When Abd al-Malik consulted al-Baqir , he proposed making coins , so that Muslims wo n\\'t need to use Roman coins . Umar II \\'s reign Umar II is often considered the righteous caliph of Islam . He did Shia many favors , forbade cursing Ali , and returned Fadak to Alids . According to Kohlberg , in a narration propagated by anti-Alids , and recorded by Ibn Sa \\'d , al-Baqir identifies the Caliph Umar II as the Mahdi . According to Shia , however , Baqir prophesied that Umar will be Caliph , will do his best to spread justice and will be honored by people , upon his death . According to this account , the inhabitants of the Earth will weep upon Umar \\'s death , while the inhabitants of the heaven will curse him , since he usurped Imam \\'s right to be Caliph , after all . Hisham \\'s reign According to Kohlberg , al-Baqir summoned several times to Damascus , at least once he kept there as a prisoner . Then he was sent to Madina , along with escorts who were ordered to give him neither food nor water on the way . According to a more detailed account , Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik made a pilgrimage to Mecca , where Mohammed al-Baqir and his son Ja\\'far al-Sadiq were present . At a gathering , al-Baqir delivered a sermon : \" We are the favorite and chosen servants of God , and His vicegerents on the face of the earth . One who obeys us is successful and one who opposes would be evil and wretched . \" His statements were conveyed to Hisham , who wrote to the governor of Medina instructing him to send al-Baqir and his son to Damascus . When they arrived , he kept them waiting for three days ; on the fourth he called them to court , where he was practicing archery with his officials . Death There is disagreement on the date of al-Bagir death . It is ranged from 114/732 to 118/736 . According to one account , Al-Baqir was poisoned by Caliph Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik . Another account says Hisham died before managing to have him poisoned . A third account says al-Baqir \\'s death was during the rein of al-Walid . Another account cited by Al-Shaykh al-Saduq says al-Baqir was poisoned by Umayyad Ibrahim b . al-Walld , during his brief rein . According to another account , Zaid ibn al-Hasan ( al-Baqir \\'s cousin ) had tried unsuccessfully to get hold of prophet \\'s inheritance which belonged to al-Baqir . After which he placed poison to al-Baqir \\'s saddle which caused his death . According to the Shi \\' i account , the Caliph gave Zaid a saddle treated with poison ; Zaid gave it to al-Baqir , who used it and died . Al-Baqir was laid to rest under the dome in al-Baqi \\' , where Hasan ibn Ali and Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin were buried . Imamate According to both main branch of Shia Islam , Twelver and Isma\\'ilis , al-Baqir inherited Imamate from his father , Zayn al-Abidin . According to al-Kulayni , Baqir received a full chest of the weapons and book of Prophet , which symbolizes authority , from his father , in presence of his brothers . During the imamah of Muhammad al-Baqir , riots erupted throughout the Islamic world due to the Umayyad Caliphate \\'s oppression . Disagreements within the Umayyad party kept them occupied , and they left members of the household undisturbed for some time . However , tyranny in the Battle of Karbala had attracted many people to the imams . These conditions had permitted people ( particularly the Shiites ) to travel to Medina in large groups and visit al-Baqir freely . The possibility of spreading Islam ( which had not existed for the previous imams ) was available to the fifth imam , indicated by a number of traditions about al-Baqir and scholars trained under him . Miracles Some miracles are attributed to al-Baqir . He could converse with animals , make the blind see , and foretell future events such as death of his brother Zayd , defeat of Umaayads and the accession of the Abbasid Caliph , al-Mansur . Division After the death of Ali ibn Husayn Zayn al-Abidin ( the fourth Imam ) , most of the Shiites agreed upon his son al-Baqir as the next imam ; a minority favored another son of Zayn al-Abidin ( Zayd ibn Ali ) , and became known as Zaidiyyah . According to Ibn Khallikan , Zaid ( Muhammad al-Baqir \\'s brother ) , appealed for people to support his cause . According to Al-Masudi , he asked for advice from Muhammad al-Baqir ; al-Baqir advised him not to rely on the people of Kufa , explaining how they had previously behaved toward the members of his household . Zaid did not listen to his brother \\'s advice , and led the people of Kufa in a fruitless riot . According to Al-Shahrastani , a dispute had arisen between Muhammad al-Baqir and Zaid because Zaid had been following the Mu\\'tazilite Wasil ibn Ata . Zaid had also announced that the position of imam was conditional on his appearing publicly to assert his rights . Muhammad al-Baqir replied , \" Your faith then is merely in your father , as such , for according to your theory he was not an imam , for he certainly never came forth to assert his claims . \" Less welcomed among Baqir \\'s followers were the Ghulat who exaggerated the holiness of the Shia Imams . Mughira ibn sa\\'id al-Bajali , the founder of the sect Mughiriyya , who claimed the divinity of al-Baqir , was rejected by the Shia Imam . Bayan ibn sam\\'an was another exterismis who asked al-Baqir to recognize him as prophet and Imam . Abu al-Khattab , the founder of the sect Ghulat , and his followers were cursed by al-Baqir . Succession Al-Baqir succeeded by his son Ja\\'far al-Sadiq , who was accepted by Shias . According to some Sunni narrators such as Al-Shahrastani , a Shia sect , named al-Bakiriyya , did not believe in al-Baqir \\'s death , considered him a Mahdi , who would return in due time . Teachings According to Lalani , al-Baqir was the first Shia Imam , from whom a vast corpus of Hadiths comes down , as the name al-baqir ( he who splits open knowledge ) shows this emergence of Knowledge in various matters , including exegesis of Quran , knowledge of ahadith of the Prophet , issues concerning law , and theological topics of both a worldly and spiritual nature . The interpretation of Quran , as the main concern of Baqir \\'s time , was in need of some other fields of knowledge such as , philology and lexicography . Also sayings and actions of the prophet which had some relevance to the subject of Qurans text , should have been collected . Rules for daily life of Muslims , were also sought from practices of the prophet which was called Sunnah . These gave rise to the knowledge of Hadith , which itself , along with Quran , were basis of knowledge of Kalam and fiqh . Baqir is known for establishing the school of Law , later recognized as the Ja\\'fari Madhhab after the name of his son , Ja\\'far al-sadiq , who expanded the school . Baqir brought back rituals like the expression Heyya ala al-salat ( come to the best of deed ) to Adhan ; forbade wiping the soles of footwear , instead of feet , in the Wudu ; and lifted prohibition from Nikah mut\\'ah . Baqir \\'s view around subjects relating Imamat , such as Islam , Imam and Ghaza wa Ghadar were distinguished among serious theological discussions took place between scholars . So al-Baqir was initiator of principles which later became distinctive tenets of Twelver Shia Islam , such as Nass ( the Imam \\'s explicit designation of his successor ) , Ilm ( the special knowledge of the Imam ) , Ismah ( the infallibility of the Imam ) and Taqiya ( precautionary dissimulation in order to avoid persecution ) . According to al-Kafi , Baqir stressed the importance of intelligence saying that Allah will hold everyone accountable on the day of judgement according to the degree of intelligence they received in the worldly life . His Disciples Muhammad al-Baqir is known as the first Shia Imam who engaged in the systematic teaching . He was living in Medina , however most of his disciples were in Kufa , some others in Mecca and Basra . Most prominent , among them were Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju\\'fi , Aban ibn Taghlib , Zurara ibn A\\'yan and Burayd ibn Mu\\'awiya al-ijli . Kufa Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju\\'fi , known sometimes as Thiqa ( trustworthy ) , is recognized as Babe ( gate ) of al-Baqir , who , related 70 secret hadiths to him . Jabir claimed that he had seen some miracles from Baqir ; still Shia do not reject him as a Ghali . Jabir is also transmitter of some Hadiths in the book Umm al-Kitab , which is Baqir \\'s answers to the questions of his followers . Jabir is also the main narrator of some other Hadiths which is collected in another book , named Risalat al-Ju\\'fi which is said , consists of Jabir \\'s view on Ismaili belief . Aban ibn Taghlib was another disciple of Muhammad al-Baqir . He was previously a disciple of Baqir \\'s father , zayn al-abedin , and lived long enough to relate tradition from Baqir \\'s son , Ja\\'far al-Sadiq , too . He was a famous Jurist and traditionist , so as Baqir said him \" Sit in the mosque of Kufa and give legal judgment to the people . Indeed I would like to see among my Shia , people like you . \" By the time of al-Sadiq , Aban was so famous that whenever he visited Madina , people would give way to him and let him lean to the column prophet used to lean . Zurarah ibn A\\'yan was a former pupil of al-Hakam ibn Utayba , then changed his allegiance and joined Muhammad al-Baqir . Zurarah and his pupils plaid an important role in the development of Shia , since a large amount of Shia traditions were transmitted through him . Zurarah lived long enough to become a close disciple of Ja\\'far al-Sadiq too . Muhammad bin Muslim was a Mawla from Thaqif , who became famous in the legal circle of Kufa for his quick decisions as a practising lawyer . He was also known as a traditionist and ascetic . Burayd ibn Mu\\'awieh Ejli was another famous disciple of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq . He was a Jurist who later became an authority in Shi \\' i Fiqh . It is known that al-Baqir said he ( along with Abu Basir Moradi , Muhammad bin Muslim , and Zurarah ) was worthy of paradise . Abu Basir Moradi is another associate of al-Baqir and al-Sadiq , who was a famous Faqih and traditionist . Al-Sadiq is believed that said Moradi , Zurarah , Burayd and Muhammad ibn Mosmlem , that without them the prophetic Hadith would have been lost . Abu Hamza al-Thumali and Abu Khalid Kameli , formerly disciples of Zayn al-Abedin , was also among al-Baqir \\'s followers . According to , Abu Hamza al-Thumali is a trusty transmitter of Hadith , mainly about miracles . Fudayl ibn Yasar is another famous associates of both al-Baqir and al-Sadiq . It is said that al-Sadiq said of him what the prophet said of Salman the Persian , that Fudayl is from us , the People of the House . al-Kumayt ibn Zayd al-Asadi was a famous poet of his time . His Hashimiyyat , was in praise of Ahl al-Bayt and was considered ancient evidence of doctrine of Imamat . Abu Ja\\'far Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Nu\\'maa was a known theologist , whose debates with adversaries in the right of Imamat , is famous . Kitab al-Imamah and Kitab al_Radd alla al-Mu\\'tazila fi Imamat al-Mafdul is among his works . Basrah Basrah was considered to be a non-shi \\' i city however there are some disciple of al-Baqir , who were located there . Muhammad ibn Marwan al-Basri was born in Kufa . According to al-Kashani , he was a descendant of Abu al-Aswad al-Du\\'ali Isma\\'il ibn Fadl al-Hashemi is another prominent follower of al-Baqir , and a trusty transmitter of Hadith . He was a descendant of Abd al-Muttalib Malek ibn A\\'yan al-juhani who should not be confused with Zurara \\'s brother who has the same name . Mecca Ma\\'ruf ibn Kharbuz Makki was a faqīh and traditionist , not comparable to Zurarah , however was well known in Mecca . According to al-Kashani he was a moderate Shia scholar . Maymun ibn al-Aswad al-Qaddah is another prominent followers of al-Baqir and his son , al-Sadiq in Mecca . According to Ivanov , Maymun was a kind of merchant who was in charge of Baqir \\'s property in Mecca.He was not an educated figure , however had an impressive character . He had sons , among them Abdullah , later became the alleged ancestor of Isma\\'ili Imams . Other Prominent followers of Muhammad al-Baqir , that is not determined where they were living : Muhammad ibn Isma\\'il Bazi , and other members of Bazi \\'s family , Abu Harun and his namesake , Abu Harun Makfuf , Uqba ibn Bashir al-Asadi , Aslam al-Makki , and Najiyy ibn Abi Mu\\'adh ibn Muslim . Works Musnad al-Imam al-Baqir Musnad al-Imam al Baqir is a six-volume book attributed to Baqir , consisting of Twelver law and Shia doctrine . It was collected by Azizallah al-Utaridi , who compiled it mostly from twelver Shia works , but also from Ismaili , Zaidi , and Sunni sources . The book covers : legal issues such as divorce , manumission , testimony , inheritance , funerals , and marriage ; ritual practices such as dua ( supplications ) , prayer , fasting , alms , and pilgrimage ; and doctrinal issues such as monotheism , the Imamate , faith , and unbelief . Ma\\'athiru \\' l-Baqir In Ma\\'athiru \\' l-Baqir al-Baqir discussed a number of topics , from the nature of the soul and the qualities of the Ulama to the attributes of God and the divine nature ( explaining that it was impossible for humans to understand it ) . A man asked him , \" Should I think of anything ( to understand Allah ) ? \" al-Baqir replied : \" Yes , but you have to imagine a thing which the mind can not contain and which is without limit . He is unlike whatever comes into your mind . Nothing resembles Him nor can any thought reach Him . \" He also said , \" Talk about the creation of Allah , but do not talk about Allah Himself , for that increases the owner of the talk nothing except perplexity . \" He defined a Rasul as a prophet who hears and sees the angel in bodily form or in a dream . A Nabi is a prophet who hears but does not see the angel , and the imam is like the Nabi . Al-Baqir was frequently asked to explain teachings about the imamate , which is also explained in Ma\\'athiru \\' l-Baqir ( a summary of which is translated into English in Canon Sell \\'s Ithna ʻAsharíyya or The Twelve Shiʻah Imams . When asked about collective knowledge of the Quran , Imam al-Baqir would say that no one collected and memorized the Holy Book as Allah revealed it except Muhammad , Ali ibn Abu Talib and the Imams of Ahl al-Bayt after him . Further , no one is able to claim that they have knowledge of the entire Quran , its apparent and hidden essence , except the executors of the will of the Holy Prophet . Umm al-Kitab Umm al-Kitab , or The Archetype of the Book , is in the form of a discussion between the imam and three companions . Resembling the Infancy Gospel of Thomas , it illustrates the similarity between imamology and gnostic Christology . A major concept of this work is the description of the numinous experience . Its central motif is the psychological and philosophical explanation of spiritual symbols , with believers instructed to perform acts of self-purification and renewal . Colors are used to symbolize theories and levels of consciousness which one must recognize in oneself . Umm al-Kitab is Baqir \\'s answers to the questions of his followers . Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju\\'fi is transmitter of some Hadiths in the book . In the main part of the book , al-Baqir reveales secrets to al-Ju\\'fi , such as how cosmos been created , how human soul fell into this world and how it could get deliverance from it . Tafsir al-Baqir Tafsir al-baqir , or Tafsir Abul Jaroud is al-Baqir \\'s exegesis of the Quran . Ibn al-Nadim included this book in his list of exegeses of the Quran in his Kitab al-Fihrist , writing that Abul Jaroud Ziyad ibn Abi Ziyad ( the head of the Jarudiyya ) reported al-Baqir \\'s book . According to Sayyd Hasan al-Sadr , \" A group of the reliable Shiites reported the book from him [ Abul Jaroud ] from the days of his righteousness \" ; among them was Abu Basïr Yahya bin al-Qasim al-Asadi . Ali bin Ibrahï~m bin Hashim al-Qummi also mentioned it in his book Kitāb al-Bāqir ( “ The book of alBāqir ” ) , by the authority of Abu Basïr . Risalat al-Ju\\'fi Risalat al-Ju\\'fi consists of Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju\\'fi \\'s view on Ismaili belief . Jabir is the main narrator of Hadiths which is collected in this book . Views Sunnis In Sunni works , al-Baqir is eminent as a Faqīh ( expert in jurisprudence ) , for his knowledge of Tafsir ( Qur\\'anic exegesis ) , and theology . He is also known as Thiqa , the most trustworthy in transmitting ahadith of Prophet Muhammad . However he is occasionally blamed for transmitting Hadiths from companions whom he never met . Al-Baqir is cited by Ibn Ishaq for some Prophetic biography and by Al-Tabari for some version of Battle of Karbala story . Abd Allah ibn Ata al-Makki says he had never seen scholars feel so small in presence of anyone as they felt before al-Baqir . He adds ; even the famous traditionist , al-Hakam ibn Utayba , despite his age and eminence , behaved al-Baqir , as so he was a pupil before a teacher . Muhammad ibn al-Munkadir says that he had not seen anyone who excel Ali ibn al-Husayn , until he met Muhammd al-Baqir . Shia sources describe a meeting between al-Baqir and Abu Hanifa in a rather negative light . Sunni sources , on the other hand , describes Abu Hanifa as a prominent disciple of al-Baqir , who had prophesied that Abu Hanifa would revive the prophet \\'s Sunnah . Shi\\'as In Sunni view , a hadith , if traced back to companions of prophet , is reliable . In Shia view , however , the companions of the prophet , are capable of error , so the infallible Imams are true transmitters of hadith . Zaidiyyah Muhammad al-Baqir is not recognized by Zaidis as Imam , however he is a prominent figure among them ; as his traditions appear in some Zaidi works like Amālī al-Imām Aḥmad b . ʿĪsā . According to Kohlberg , al-Baqir appears in Zaidi works as \" acknowledging Zayd \\'s superior knowledge and so , by implication , Zayd \\'s claims to the Imamate . \" Isma\\'ilism Al-Baqir is Ismaiilie \\'s fourth Imam , and an authority in Ismaili law . According to Al-Qadi al-Nu\\'man , the reliability of al-Baqir was such that an ethnically Maqtu ( interrupted or broken ) Hadith was regarded as Mawsul ( linked ) and was mentioned as Marfu ( traceable to Prophet ) when narrated by him . Sufis Muhammad al-Baqir is a well known figure among Sufi , who frequently mentioned him in their biography books as being an expert in the intricacies of the ( esoteric ) sciences ( daqāʾiq al-ʿulūm ) , the subtle allusions of the Quran ( al-ishārāt ) , spiritual path ( al-sulūk ) , and gnosis ( maʿārif ) . Baqir is also known as performing well-known miracles ( karāmāt ) , radiant signs ( āyāt ) , and distinct proofs ( barāhīn ) among Sufies , and is said he gained the spiritual stations of the gnostics ( maqāmāt al-ʿārifīn ) . Al-Baqir has defined Sufism as \" goodness of disposition : he that has the better disposition is the better Sufi \" . Ghulats Among the extremists who claimed the got their knowledge and authority from al-Baqir , were Abu Mansur al-Idjli , and reportedly al-Mughira ibn Sa\\'id al-Idjli , who said al-Baqir was a prophet and consider themselves a designated successor to al-Baqir . Kohlberg Identifies Jabir ibn Yazid al-Ju\\'fi as an Shia extremist or ghālī .

It is often used alone , somewhat loosely , to refer to people of British descent in North America , the Caribbean , South Africa , Namibia , Australia , and New Zealand . It is used in Canada to differentiate between the French speakers ( Francophone ) of mainly Quebec and some parts of New Brunswick , and the English speakers ( Anglophone ) in the rest of Canada . It is also used in the United States to distinguish the growing Spanish-speaking Latino population from the English-speaking majority . It is also used , both in English-speaking and non-English-speaking countries , to refer to Anglophone people of other European origins . Anglo is a Late Latin prefix used to denote English- in conjunction with another toponym or demonym . The word is derived from Anglia , the Latin name for England and still used in the modern name for its eastern region , East Anglia . Anglia and England both mean land of the Angles , a Germanic people originating in the north German peninsula of Angeln , that is , the region of today \\'s Lower Saxony that joins the Jutland Peninsula . ( There are various hypotheses for the origin of the name \\'Angeln \\' . ) It is also often used to refer to British in historical and other contexts after the Acts of Union 1707 , for example such as in the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 , where in later years agreement was between the British government and the Dutch , not an English government . Typical examples of this use are also shown below , where non-English people from the British Isles are described as being Anglo . Anglo is not an easily defined term . For traditionalists , there are linguistic problems with using the word as an adjective or noun on its own . For example , the purpose of the -o ending is to enable the formation of a compound term ( for example Anglo-Saxon meaning of Angle and Saxon origin ) , so there is only an apparent parallelism between , for example , Latino and Anglo . However , a semantic change has taken place in many English-speaking regions so that in informal usage the meanings listed below are common . The definition is changed in each region which defines how it is identified . Specialized usage Africa The term Anglo-African has been used historically to self-identify by people of mixed British and African ancestry born in the United States and in Africa . The Anglo-African and The Weekly Anglo-African were the names of newspapers published by African American abolitionist Robert Hamilton ( 1819–1870 ) in New York during the American Civil War era . The Anglo-African was also the name of a newspaper published in Lagos ( now part of Nigeria ) from 1863 to 1865 . It was founded and edited by Robert Campbell ( 1829–1884 ) , a Jamaican born son of a Scottish father and Mulatto mother . The term has also been used historically to describe people living in the British Empire in Africa . The Anglo-African Who \\'s Who and Biographical Sketch-Book published in London in 1905 includes details of prominent British and Afrikaner people in Africa at that time . Australia In Australia , Anglo is used as part of the terms Anglo-Australian and Anglo-Celtic , which refer to the majority of Australians , who are of English , Scottish , Welsh and Irish descent . Canada In Canada , and especially in Canadian French , Anglophone is widely used to designate someone whose mother tongue is English , as opposed to Francophone , which describes someone whose mother tongue is French , and to Allophone , which describes someone whose mother tongue is a language other than English or French . Anglo-Métis is also sometimes used to refer to an ethnic group . Israel Immigrants from English-speaking countries are sometimes referred to as Anglos . Scotland In Scotland the term Anglo-Scot , often shortened to Anglos , is used to refer to people with mixed Scottish-English ancestry , or people with English ancestry born in Scotland . The term Anglo-Scot is more often used to describe Scottish sports players who are based in England or playing for English teams , or vice versa . This usage is especially used in football and notably in rugby union , where the Anglo Scots were a Scottish non-native select provincial District side that competed in the Scottish Inter-District Championship . United States In many parts of the United States , especially those with high Latino populations , \" Anglo-American \" is shortened to \" Anglo \" and applied to white Americans who are not of Latino origin and sometimes to those who are not of French origin , but the latter criterion is based on specific linguistic considerations and limited to Louisiana and parts of Texas . If language is taken into consideration the term \" Anglo-American \" also excludes Franco-Americans such as the Cajuns of Louisiana , but would include them when language is excluded as a criterion . In the Southwest United States , \" Anglo \" , short for \" Anglo American \" , is used as a synonym for non-Latino whites ; that is European Americans ( except people who speak Romance languages ) , most of whom speak the English language , even those who are not necessarily of English or British descent . Some non-Latino whites in the United States who speak English but are not of English or British ancestry do not identify with the term Anglo and find the term offensive . For instance , some Cajuns in south Louisiana use the term to refer to area whites who do not have Francophone backgrounds . Irish Americans , the second largest self-identified ethnic group in the United States following German-Americans , also sometimes take umbrage at being called \" Anglo \" .

The 100-episode series was quickly created by Hal Seeger , starting in 1966 , to send up the popular Batman and The Green Hornet television series , which had premiered the same year . Production and syndication The cartoon was produced at Hal Seeger Studios , in New York City , and at Bill Ackerman Productions in Midland Park , New Jersey . It was syndicated by Screen Gems and continued to air on local stations throughout the 1980s . Nickelodeon briefly aired episodes of Batfink on Weinerville as well as its Nick in the Afternoon block in 1995 and 1997 . In September 2006 , it returned to the U.S . as part of \" Cartoons Without a Clue \" , Boomerang \\'s mystery lineup on weekends . The Batfink series was very popular in the U.K. , becoming a cult series like the later Danger Mouse , and from 1967 onwards was shown at least once every year on U.K . terrestrial television until 1983 , initially on the BBC network , where it was allocated an early evening slot just before the BBC News , and latterly as part of Children \\'s ITV ; it subsequently reappeared in 1986 on the ITV Saturday morning magazine show Get Fresh . In the early 1990s it was repeated again as part of TV-am \\'s Wide Awake Club/Wacaday series ; after Wacaday finished in 1992 , Batfink was consigned to the vaults in the U.K . for the next 12 years . It was introduced to a new audience in 2004 when it was included in a number of episodes of the BBC \\'s Saturday morning show Dick and Dom in da Bungalow , and since April 2006 has been enjoying an extended , if somewhat irregular , repeat run on CBBC . Batfink was made quickly and cheaply by re-using stock sequences . Although most serial animations do this to some extent , Batfink did it more than most . Commonly repeated scenes include the intro to the initial briefings by the Chief ( the TV screen hotline buzzing into life ) , Batfink and Karate getting into the Battillac , the Battillac going round mountain bends , the Battillac going over a bridge , Batfink \\'s supersonic sonar radar and others . Sometimes the repeated scenes would be cut short so that sections could be re-used to fit the storyline more closely . Plot Batfink is a bat superhero with metal wings . With the help of his aide , Karate , he fights crime in his city , with his recurring villain being Hugo A-Go-Go . Cliffhangers Many episodes end with Batfink in a dangerous situation ; typically this is effected by trapping him in some sort of bondage , placing him in a position that renders his wings useless . At the moment the potentially fatal shot is fired , the action freezes , and the narrator asks dramatically if Batfink will survive . Then , the action continues with Batfink escaping , via a convenient but previously unseen deus ex machina or through the use of his superpowers . Characters Batfink Batfink ( voiced by Frank Buxton ) is a superpowered anthropomorphic grey bat in a yellow costume with a big red \" B \" on the chest and red gauntlets and boots . He uses his supersonic sonar radar and black metallic wings to fight crime . Batfink \\'s \" supersonic sonar radar \" is a super-powered version of a bat \\'s echolocation , used to locate prey . Batfink \\'s power takes the form of the letters of the word \" BEEP \" either once or twice emanating from his mouth . The letters are anthropomorphic and sentient and can fly wherever Batfink needs them to go – accompanied by a distinctive beeping noise . His catchphrase during that time is \" My supersonic sonar radar will help me ! \" Whenever Batfink said those words , he would say it through the open sun roof of the Battilac car , while it was not in motion . The letters can see ; feel fear ; evade capture ; and report back to Batfink on what they have seen . In one episode , the \" BEEP \" is ambushed and beaten up . The \" BEEP \" also gets confused , misdirected and lost , leaving Batfink to rely on other means to spy upon the episode \\'s villain . Once , when the \" BEEP \" is sent to investigate Queenie Bee and her swarm of villainous bees , it returns with the letters \" EEP \" swollen with bee stings . When Karate asks Batfink : \" How come they just stung the EEP ? \" Batfink replies : \" Because a bee would never harm another B . But a B will tell on another bee – Queenie Bee is in THERE ! \" The literal spelled-out appearance of an onomatopœia was a running gag not limited to the supersonic sonar radar ; in one episode , Hugo A-Go-Go invented a tickling stick that tickles its adversaries into submission , which sent out the words \" Kitchy Koo \" to do the deed on Batfink ( the episode ended with Batfink slicing the K \\'s off to create the far more irritating , but less distracting , \" Itchy Oo \" ) . Batfink \\'s main defense are his metallic wings , which he is able to fold around himself as a protective shield against most attacks , thereby spawning the most famous catchphrase of the show : \" Your bullets can not harm me – my wings are like a shield of steel ! \" He claims in some episodes that his wings are stainless steel , but in other episodes he explicitly states that they are not – since he always carries a can of spot remover to keep them polished . Batfink can also use his wings as offensive weapons . In one episode , he uses one of them as a sword during a duel . His wings can also help him fly at incredible speeds . They are often used to help him escape certain death or cut through bonds when he has been captured ( he can break out of regular ropes , but not rubber ones ) . In the episode \" Ebenezer the Freezer \" , Batfink has automatic retrorockets built into his wings , but not in any other episode . Sometimes his wings hinder him . When in water , he will sink because of the weight of his metal wings . Powerful magnets are also a problem for him . Plutonium , for reasons unexplained ( but possibly relating to his birth in a plutonium mine ) also renders the wings useless . Batfink \\'s life and wings are explained in the final episode , \" Batfink : This Is Your Life \" , which depicts his boyhood and how his real wings were replaced . Batfink rides in a customized pink car resembling a Volkswagen Beetle with scalloped rear fins and bat-winged red \" B \" emblems on the doors and hood . Called the \" Battillac \" ( rhymes with \" Cadillac \" ) , it is outfitted with a sun roof and many defensive devices . The car is resistant to collision damage and energy weapons . Batfink often says something like \" It \\'s a good thing the Battillac is equipped with a thermonuclear plutonium-insulated blast shield ! \" and Karate replies , \" It \\'s also good it was a small bomb \" . As soon as a crime is acknowledged , Batfink says \" Karate , the Battillac ! \" In the last episode of the series titled \" Batfink : This Is Your Life \" , it is revealed that he obtained his powers when he was born in an abandoned plutonium mine and that he lost his natural wings as a child while saving his mother \\'s life , after escaped convicts blew up their mountain-top cave ( plutonium in real life is too scarce in the Earth \\'s crust to be mined , it must be synthesized , usually from uranium ) . This incident is what motivated him to become a crime-fighter . Batfink lives in a split-level cave , and has a direct video link to the Chief \\'s office . Karate Kara \" Karate \" Te ( voiced by Len Maxwell ) is a gi-clad martial arts expert and Batfink \\'s oafish sidekick who drives the Battillac . He is somewhat oversized and not very bright , but is strong enough to help Batfink out of any situation . He carries a wide variety of objects and gadgets in his \" utility sleeve \" ( a parody of Batman \\'s utility belt ) , but he often has trouble finding what he needs in it . Karate tends to succeed by dumb luck rather than by skill or ingenuity , and often Karate \\'s involvement will make a bad situation worse . Karate is a direct send-up of Kato , the Green Hornet \\'s companion , but his hulking size is inspired by the James Bond villain Oddjob . Also as in The Green Hornet episodes , when both characters are in the car , Karate is the driver while Batfink rides in the back seat . In early episodes , his voice is a stereotypical Asian accent , but in later episodes , Len Maxwell adopts a clipped and nasal speech pattern . This was inspired by Don Adams , whose Get Smart character , Maxwell Smart , was popular at the time . Karate on occasion even utters the Maxwell Smart-inspired catchphrase , \" Sorry about that , Batfink \" . Karate was usually ordered to check downstairs while Batfink checked the upper floor . At the end of each episode , Karate would make a corny pun that was sometimes physical on the part of his stupidity . Karate \\'s father was the blacksmith who made Batfink \\'s metallic wings . The Chief The Chief ( voiced by Len Maxwell ) is Batfink \\'s contact on the local police force and informs Batfink of all the latest crimes via a direct video link to Batfink \\'s Split-Level Cave as Batfink answers \" The hotline — Batfink here \" . The Mayor The Mayor is the unnamed mayor of the city that Batfink protects . The Narrator The Narrator ( voiced by Len Maxwell ) narrates each episode while explaining certain information and does the cliffhanger narration . Hugo A-Go-Go The blue-smocked , wild-haired Hugo A-Go-Go ( voiced by Frank Buxton ) is the main villain of the series . He is referred to as \" the world \\'s maddest mad scientist \" and spends his time in his \" secret \" laboratory creating weird and wacky inventions ( including a robot bride , complete with robot mother-in-law ) to defeat Batfink and dominate the world . He always manages to escape jail to antagonize the hero in a later episode . Hugo A-Go-Go often breaks the fourth wall and has conversations with the narrator . Other villains Other villains that are Batfink \\'s enemies are : Ebeneezer the Freezer - a villain who collaborated with Hugo A-Go-Go in a plot to freeze the city . Mr .

Hidden political message According to Dave Mackey \\'s Batfink site , a two-part political message is concealed in two episodes , disguised as sped-up gibberish . He translates the message as follows : Part 1 ( in \" Spin the Batfink \" ) : \" The most dangerous force in America today is Walter Reuther and his political machine . It ’ s time we realized that they intend to run this country . When the smut publishers put a ... \" Part 2 ( in \" Bride and Doom \" ) : \" ... dirty cover on a clean book , let ’ s take it at face value and call it trash and dump it in the river \" .

The surgery is also called ovariectomy , but this term is mostly used in reference to animals , e.g . the surgical removal of ovaries from laboratory animals . Removal of the ovaries of females is the biological equivalent of castration of males ; the term castration is only occasionally used in the medical literature to refer to oophorectomy of women . In veterinary medicine , the removal of ovaries and uterus is called ovariohysterectomy ( spaying ) and is a form of sterilization . Partial oophorectomy or ovariotomy is a term sometimes used to describe a variety of surgeries such as ovarian cyst removal , or resection of parts of the ovaries . This kind of surgery is fertility-preserving , although ovarian failure may be relatively frequent . Most of the long-term risks and consequences of oophorectomy are not or only partially present with partial oophorectomy . In humans , oophorectomy is most often performed because of diseases such as ovarian cysts or cancer ; as prophylaxis to reduce the chances of developing ovarian cancer or breast cancer ; or in conjunction with hysterectomy ( removal of the uterus ) . In the 1890s people believed oophorectomies could cure menstrual cramps , back pain , headaches , and chronic coughing , although no evidence existed that the procedure impacted any of these ailments . The removal of an ovary together with the Fallopian tube is called salpingo-oophorectomy or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( USO ) . When both ovaries and both Fallopian tubes are removed , the term bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy ( BSO ) is used . Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy are not common forms of birth control in humans ; more usual is tubal ligation , in which the Fallopian tubes are blocked but the ovaries remain intact . In many cases , surgical removal of the ovaries is performed concurrently with a hysterectomy . The formal medical name for removal of a woman \\'s entire reproductive system ( ovaries , Fallopian tubes , uterus ) is \" total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy \" ( TAH-BSO ) ; the more casual term for such a surgery is \" ovariohysterectomy \" . \" Hysterectomy \" is removal of the uterus ( from the Greek ὑστέρα hystera \" womb \" and εκτομία ektomia \" a cutting out of \" ) without removal of the ovaries or Fallopian tubes . Technique Oophorectomy for benign causes is most often performed by abdominal laparoscopy . Abdominal laparotomy or robotic surgery is used in complicated cases or when a malignancy is suspected . Statistics According to the Centers for Disease Control , 454,000 women in the United States underwent oophorectomy in 2004 . The first successful operation of this type , account of which was published in the Eclectic Repertory and Analytic Review ( Philadelphia ) in 1817 , was performed by Ephraim McDowell ( 1771-1830 ) , a surgeon from Danville , Kentucky . McDowell was dubbed as the \" father of ovariotomy \" . It later became known as Battey \\'s Operation , after Robert Battey , a surgeon from Augusta , Georgia , who championed the procedure for a variety of conditions , most successfully for ovarian epilepsy . Indication Most bilateral oophorectomies ( 63 % ) are performed without any medical indication , and most ( 87 % ) are performed together with a hysterectomy . Conversely , unilateral oophorectomy is commonly performed for a medical indication ( 73 % ; cyst , endometriosis , benign tumor , inflammation , etc . ) and less commonly in conjunction with hysterectomy ( 61 % ) . Special indications include several groups of women with substantially increased risk of ovarian cancer , such as high-risk BRCA mutation carriers and women with endometriosis who also suffer from frequent ovarian cysts . Bilateral oophorectomy has been traditionally done in the belief that the benefit of preventing ovarian cancer would outweigh the risks associated with removal of ovaries . However , it is now clear that prophylactic oophorectomy without a reasonable medical indication decreases long-term survival rates substantially and has deleterious long-term effects on health and well-being even in post-menopausal women . The procedure has been postulated as a possible treatment method for female sex offenders . Cancer prevention Oophorectomy can significantly improve survival for women with high-risk BRCA mutations , for whom prophylactic oophorectomy around age 40 reduces the risk of ovarian and breast cancer and provides significant and substantial long-term survival advantage . On average , earlier intervention does not provide any additional benefit but increases risks and adverse effects . For women with high-risk BRCA2 mutations , oophorectomy around age 40 has a relatively modest benefit for survival ; the positive effect of reduced breast and ovarian cancer risk is nearly balanced by adverse effects . The survival advantage is more substantial when oophorectomy is performed together with prophylactic mastectomy . It is important to understand that the risks and benefits associated with oophorectomy in the BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population are different than those for the general population . Prophylactic risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy ( RRSO ) is an important option for the high-risk population to consider . Women with BRCA1/2 mutations who undergo salpingo-oophorectomy have lower all-cause mortality rates than women in the same population who do not undergo this procedure . In addition , RRSO has been shown to decrease mortality specific to breast cancer and ovarian cancer . Women who undergo RRSO are also at a lower risk for developing ovarian cancer and first occurrence breast cancer . Specifically , RRSO provides BRCA1 mutation carriers with no prior breast cancer a 70 % reduction of ovarian cancer risk . BRCA1 mutation carriers with prior breast cancer can benefit from an 85 % reduction . High-risk women who have not had prior breast cancer can benefit from a 37 % ( BRCA1 mutation ) and 64 % ( BRCA2 mutation ) reduction of breast cancer risk . These benefits are important to highlight , as they are unique to this BRCA1/2 mutation carrier population . Endometriosis In rare cases , oophorectomy can be used to treat endometriosis by eliminating the menstrual cycle , which will reduce or eliminate the spread of existing endometriosis as well as reducing pain . Since endometriosis results from an overgrowth of the uterine lining , removal of the ovaries as a treatment for endometriosis is often done in conjunction with a hysterectomy to further reduce or eliminate recurrence . Oophorectomy for endometriosis is used only as last resort , often in conjunction with a hysterectomy , as it has severe side effects for women of reproductive age . However , it has a higher success rate than retaining the ovaries . Partial oophorectomy ( i.e. , ovarian cyst removal not involving total oophorectomy ) is often used to treat milder cases of endometriosis when non-surgical hormonal treatments fail to stop cyst formation . Removal of ovarian cysts through partial oophorectomy is also used to treat extreme pelvic pain from chronic hormonal-related pelvic problems . Risks and adverse effects Surgical risks Oophorectomy is an intra-abdominal surgery and serious complications stemming directly from the surgery are rare . When performed together with hysterectomy , it has influence on choice of surgical technique as the combined surgery is much less likely to be performed by vaginal hysterectomy . Laparotomic adnexal surgeries are associated with a high rate of adhesive small bowel obstructions ( 24 % ) . An infrequent complication is injuring of the ureter at the level of the suspensory ligament of the ovary . Long-term effects Oophorectomy has serious long-term consequences stemming mostly from the hormonal effects of the surgery and extending well beyond menopause . The reported risks and adverse effects include premature death , cardiovascular disease , cognitive impairment or dementia , parkinsonism , osteoporosis and bone fractures , decline in psychological well-being , and decline in sexual function . Hormone replacement therapy does not always reduce the adverse effects . Mortality Oophorectomy is associated with significantly increased all-cause long-term mortality except when performed for cancer prevention in carriers of high-risk BRCA mutations . This effect is particularly pronounced for women who undergo oophorectomy before age 45 . The effect is not limited to women who have oophorectomy performed before menopause ; an impact on survival is expected even for surgeries performed up to the age of 65 . Surgery at age 50-54 reduces the probability of survival until age 80 by 8 % ( from 62 % to 54 % survival ) , surgery at age 55-59 by 4 % . Most of this effect is due to excess cardiovascular risk and hip fractures . Removal of ovaries causes hormonal changes and symptoms similar to , but generally more severe than , menopause . Women who have had an oophorectomy are usually encouraged to take hormone replacement drugs to prevent other conditions often associated with menopause . Women younger than 45 who have had their ovaries removed face a mortality risk 170 % higher than women who have retained their ovaries . Retaining the ovaries when a hysterectomy is performed is associated with better long-term survival . Hormone therapy for women with oophorectomies performed before age 45 improves the long-term outcome and all-cause mortality rates . Menopausal effects Women who have had bilateral oophorectomy surgeries lose most of their ability to produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone , and lose about half of their ability to produce testosterone , and subsequently enter what is known as \" surgical menopause \" ( as opposed to normal menopause , which occurs naturally in women as part of the aging process ) . In natural menopause the ovaries generally continue to produce low levels of hormones , especially androgens , long after menopause , which may explain why surgical menopause is generally accompanied by a more sudden and severe onset of symptoms than natural menopause , symptoms that may continue until the natural age of menopause . These symptoms are commonly addressed through hormone therapy , utilizing various forms of estrogen , testosterone , progesterone , or a combination . Cardiovascular risk When the ovaries are removed , a woman is at a seven times greater risk of cardiovascular disease , but the mechanisms are not precisely known . The hormone production of the ovaries currently can not be sufficiently mimicked by drug therapy . The ovaries produce hormones a woman needs throughout her entire life , in the quantity they are needed , at the time they are needed , in response to and as part of the complex endocrine system . Osteoporosis Oophorectomy is associated with an increased risk of osteoporosis and bone fractures . A potential risk for oophorectomy performed after menopause is not fully elucidated . Reduced levels of testosterone in women is predictive of height loss , which may occur as a result of reduced bone density . In women under the age of 50 who have undergone oophorectomy , hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) is often used to offset the negative effects of sudden hormonal loss such as early-onset osteoporosis as well as menopausal problems like hot flashes that are usually more severe than those experienced by women undergoing natural menopause . Adverse effect on sexuality Oophorectomy substantially impairs sexuality . Substantially more women who had both an oophorectomy and a hysterectomy reported libido loss , difficulty with sexual arousal , and vaginal dryness than those who had a less invasive procedure ( either hysterectomy alone or an alternative procedure ) , and hormone replacement therapy was not found to improve these symptoms . In addition , oophorectomy greatly reduces testosterone levels , which are associated with a greater sense of sexual desire in women . However , at least one study has shown that psychological factors , such as relationship satisfaction , are still the best predictor of sexual activity following oophorectomy . Sexual intercourse remains possible after oophorectomy and coitus can continue . Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions . Managing side effects of prophylactic oophorectomy Non-hormonal treatments The side effects of oophorectomy may be alleviated by medicines other than hormonal replacement . Non-hormonal biphosphonates ( such as Fosamax and Actonel ) increase bone strength and are available as once-a-week pills . Low-dose selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Paxil and Prozac alleviate vasomotor menopausal symptoms , i.e. , \" hot flashes \" . Hormonal treatments In general , hormone replacement therapy is somewhat controversial due to the known carcinogenic and thrombogenic properties of estrogen ; however , many physicians and patients feel the benefits outweigh the risks in women who may face serious health and quality-of-life issues as a consequence of early surgical menopause . The ovarian hormones estrogen , progesterone , and testosterone are involved in the regulation of hundreds of bodily functions ; it is believed by some doctors that hormone therapy programs mitigate surgical menopause side effects such as increased risk of cardiovascular disease , and female sexual dysfunction . Short-term hormone replacement with estrogen has negligible effect on overall mortality for high-risk BRCA mutation carriers . Based on computer simulations , overall mortality appears to be marginally higher for short-term HRT after oophorectomy or marginally lower for short-term HRT after oophorectomy in combination with mastectomy . This result can probably be generalized to other women at high risk in whom short-term ( i.e. , one- or two-year ) treatment with estrogen for hot flashes may be acceptable .

The word derives from the Latin , the past participle of , which means \\'carry before \\' , \\'be set above or over \\' or \\'prefer \\' ; hence , a prelate is one set over others . The archetypal prelate is a bishop , whose prelature is his particular church . All other prelates , including the regular prelates such as abbots and major superiors , are based upon this original model of prelacy . Related terminology In a general sense , a \" prelate \" in the Roman Catholic Church and other Christian churches is a bishop or other ecclesiastical person who possesses ordinary authority of a jurisdiction , i.e. , of a diocese or similar jurisdiction , e.g. , ordinariates , apostolic vicariates/exarchates , or territorial abbacies . It equally applies to cardinals , who enjoy a kind of \" co-governance \" of the church as the most senior ecclesiastical advisers and moral representatives of the Supreme Pontiff , and certain \" superior prelates of the offices of the Roman Curia \" who are not bishops , e.g. , the auditors ( judges ) of the Roman Rota and protonotaries apostolic . By extension , it refers to \" inferior \" or \" lesser prelates \" , that is priests who have the title and dress of prelates as a personal honorific , i.e. , Papal chaplains , prelates of honor ( formerly \" domestic prelates \" ) , and honorary protonotaries apostolic . All these enjoy the title of \" monsignor \" , which also is used in some nations for bishops and archbishops . The seven de numero protonotaries apostolic in Rome , who are special Papal notaries , are true prelates like bishops ; others are \" supernumerary \" protonotaries apostolic who enjoy this as an honorific , like Papal chaplains and prelates of honor . In the strict canonical sense , \" prelate \" denominates a priest or bishop who is ordinary of a personal prelature ( see below ) , which is a functional equivalent of a diocese that has a \" particular pastoral or missionary work for various regions or for different social groups \" ( cf . Code of Canon Law , Canon 294 ) yet no territorial jurisdiction . In the Armenian Apostolic Church , \" prelate \" ( in English ) denominates a diocesan bishop , whose jurisdiction of his diocese is denominated a \" prelacy \" . Territorial prelatures In the Catholic Church , a territorial prelate is a prelate whose geographic jurisdiction , denominated a \" territorial prelature \" , is outside of and therefore not subject to any diocese . A territorial prelate is sometimes denominated a \" prelate nullius \" , from the Latin \" nullius diœceseos \" ( prelate of no diocese ) , denoting that his territory is directly subject to the Holy See ( the Supreme Pontiff ) and is not a diocese . , there were 44 territorial prelatures , all of which were in the Latin Church . The term also is used generically , in which case it may equally refer to an apostolic prefecture , an apostolic vicariate , or a territorial abbacy . Personal prelatures In the Catholic Church , the personal prelature was conceived during the Second Vatican Council ( 1962–65 ) in no . 10 of the decree Presbyterorum ordinis and Pope St . Paul VI later enacted it into law in the motu proprio Ecclesiae sanctae . The institution was later reaffirmed in the Code of Canon Law of 1983 . Such a prelature is an institution having clergy and , possibly , lay members which would execute specific pastoral activities . The adjective \" personal \" refers to the fact that , in contrast with previous canonical use for ecclesiastical institutions , the jurisdiction of the prelate is not territorial and instead is of specific persons wherever they are located . The establishment of personal prelatures is an exercise of the theologically inherent power of self-organization which the Church has in order to pursue its mission , though a personal prelature is not a particular church , as are dioceses and military ordinariates . Personal prelatures are fundamentally secular organizations operating in the world ( members do not take vows and live normal , everyday lives ) , whereas religious institutes are religious organizations operating out of the world ( members take vows and live in accordance with the proper law of their institute ) . The first , and presently only , personal prelature is Opus Dei , which Pope John Paul II erected as such in 1982 by the Apostolic constitution Ut sit . In the case of Opus Dei , the Prelate is elected by members of the Prelature and confirmed by the Supreme Pontiff ; the laity and clergy of the Prelature remain subject to the government of the particular churches in whose territory they live , and the laity associated with the Prelature , both men and women , are organically united under the jurisdiction of the Prelate . Guidelines On 15 February 2018 , a motu proprio issued by Pope Francis ordered prelates and bishops to live simply and renounce any desire for power after they retire from senior offices of the Roman Curia . A number of such officials and bishops had been criticized in the preceding years for luxurious living , such as having large apartments and police escorts after they retired . One notable incident involved Tarcisio Bertone , an Italian prelate and former Cardinal Secretary of State removed from office in 2013 , who used an apartment that had been renovated at the cost of nearly half a million dollars in funds , which were diverted from a Vatican-owned hospital by the former president of the hospital . Even after he retired , Tarcisio Bertone used escorts of Vatican City and Italian police to move around Rome .

It commonly designates a chief of a tribe or a royal family member in Arabian countries , in some countries it is also given to those of great knowledge in religious affairs as a surname by a prestige religious leader from a chain of Sufi scholars . It is also commonly used to refer to a Muslim religious scholar . It is also used as an honorary title by people claiming to be descended from Hasan ibn Ali and Husayn ibn Ali both patrilineal and matrilineal who are grandsons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad . The term is literally translated to \" Elder \" ( is also translated to \" Lord/Master \" in a monarchical context ) . Etymology and meaning The word in Arabic stems from a triliteral root connected with age and aging : , shīn-yā\\'-khā \" \\' . The title carries the meaning leader , elder , or noble , especially in the Arabian Peninsula within the Tribes of Arabia , where shaikh became a traditional title of a Bedouin tribal leader in recent centuries . Due to the cultural impact of Arab civilization , and especially through the spread of Islam , the word has gained currency as a religious term or general honorific in many other parts of the world as well , notably in Muslim cultures in Africa and Asia . Sufi term In Sufism , the word sheikh is used to represent a spiritual guide who initiates a particular tariqa which leads to Muhammad , although many saints have this title added before their names out of respect from their followers . A couple of prominent examples are Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani , who initiated the Qadiriyya order , and Shaikh Ahmad al-Tijani , who initiated the Tijaniyyah sufi order . Regional usage Arabian Peninsula In the Arabian Peninsula , the title is used for chiefs of tribes . This also includes royalty in most of Eastern Arabia , where the royal families were traditionally considered tribal chiefs . For example , it is used by the UAE Al-Nahyan dynasty and Al Maktoum dynasty , who are considered the chiefs of the Bani Yas tribe , and by Kuwait \\'s Al Sabah dynasty and Bahrain \\'s Al Khalifa dynasty of the Bani Utbah tribal confederation . The term is used by almost every male and female ( sheikha ) member of the royal houses of the UAE , Bahrain , Qatar , and Kuwait . The title is not used by members of Al Saud of Saudi Arabia , where the title \" Prince \" ( ) is used instead . The title is also used to refer to religious leaders for both Sunni and Shia Muslims . For example , the Saudi Arabian family Al ash-Sheikh ( literally House of the Sheikh ) is named after the religious leader and eponymous founder of Wahhabism , Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab . Lebanon In Mount Lebanon , the title had the same princely and royal connotation as in the Arabian peninsula until the Ottoman invasion in 1516 , since it represented an indigenous autonomous \" sui iuris \" ruler or tribal chief . Examples of some ancient families that hold the title of \" sui iuris \" sheikh is the Al-Chemor family , ruling since 1211 CE in Koura and Zgharta until 1747 CEBook Al-Sheikh Al-Chemor Al-Hakum Al-Akoura Al-Hakum Al-Zawyia , Ignatios Tannous Al-Khoury , Beirut , 1948 , pg.123 and the Boudib Family ( descendants of the Hashemite Family ) who were Ehdenian rulers of Jebbeh since 1471 CE until 1759 CE . Descendants of this royal family now live in Miziara , Mexico and Nigeria . Even the Abu Harmoush family heads , which ruled the Chouf region until the Battle of Ain Dara in 1711 CE , were \" sui iuris \" sheikhs . After the Ottoman rule and the implementation of the Iltizam system , the title gained a noble instead of royal connotation , since it was bestowed by a higher authority ; in this case the Ottoman appointed Emir , who was nothing more than a mültezim or tax collector for the empire . Some very influential Maronite families , who had the title bestowed upon them , are ( in chronological order ) : El Hachem of Akoura ( descendants of the Hashemite Family , since 1523 ) , El-Khazen ( since 1545 ) , Hubaysh of Kisrawan and Douaihy of Zgharta . Other families who are nowadays addressed or known as \" sheikhs \" were not traditionally rulers of provinces , but instead they were high-ranking officials at the service of the Emir at that time . Maghreb In the Maghreb , during the Almohad dynasty , the caliph was also counseled by a body of shaykhs . They represented all the different tribes under their rules , including Arabs , ( Bedouins ) , Andalusians and Berbers and were also responsible for mobilizing their kinsmen in the event of war . Horn of Africa In the Muslim parts of the Horn of Africa , \" sheikh \" is often used as a noble title . In Somali society , it is reserved as an honorific for senior Muslim leaders and clerics ( wadaad ) , and is often abbreviated to \" Sh \" . Famous local sheikhs include Ishaaq bin Ahmed , an early Muslim scholar and Islamic preacher , Abdirahman bin Isma\\'il al-Jabarti , an early Muslim leader in Somaliland ; Abadir Umar Ar-Rida , the patron saint of Harar ; Abd al-Rahman al-Jabarti , Sheikh of the riwaq in Cairo who recorded the Napoleonic invasion of Egypt ; Abd Al-Rahman bin Ahmad al-Zayla \\' i , scholar who played a crucial role in the spread of the Qadiriyyah movement in Somalia and East Africa ; Shaykh Sufi , 19th century scholar , poet , reformist and astrologist ; Abdallah al-Qutbi , polemicist , theologian and philosopher best known for his five-part Al-Majmu\\'at al-mubaraka ( \" The Blessed Collection \" ) ; and Muhammad Al-Sumaalee , teacher in the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca who influenced many of the prominent Islamic scholars of today . South Asia In South Asia it is not an ethnic title but an occupational title attributed to Muslim trading families . After the advent of Islam in South Asia , many Hindu clans from different castes ( Brahmins , Rajputs , Khatris , Kayasthas , Vaishyas and Dalits ) converted to Islam and adopted the title . In the Punjab region of India ; the Hindu Brahmins , Kshatriya , Rathores , Bhattis , Chauhans , Manihars and other Rajputs converted by different Ismaili Pirs to Islam . Ismaili Pirs gave the new converts of Punjab- the hereditary title of Shaikh as well as the Muslims who immigrated from Central Asia and settled in the Punjab region of India adopted this title . Southeast Asia In Indonesia and other parts of Southeast Asia , sheikhs are respected by local Muslims . In Indonesia , the term is usually spelled \" syech \" , and this is usually attributed to elderly ulama . Higher knowledgeable people of Islamic studies in Indonesia are usually referred to as \" ustad \" or \" kyai \" . Iran From the perspective of Iran , the word or title of sheikh possesses diverse meanings , among individuals who are aged and wise , it has been an honorific title used for elders and learned scholars , such as : Sheikh al-Rayees Abu Ali Sina , Sheikh Mufid , Sheikh Morteza Ansari . In the past , Islamic scholars who were the Islamic prophet Muhammad \\'s descendants , were called Sayyid/Seyyed instead of sheikh . For women Historically , female scholars in Islam were referred to as shaykhah ( Arabic : ) ( alt . shaykhat ) . Notable shaykha include the 10th-century Shaykhah Fakhr-un-Nisa Shuhdah and 18th-century scholar Al-Shaykha Fatima al-Fudayliyya . A daughter or wife or mother of a sheikh is also called a shaykhah . Currently , the term shaykhah \" is commonly used for women of ruling families in the Arab states of the Arabian Peninsula .

Sometimes this position is held in conjunction with Reformed Christian confessions of faith in traditional Calvinist doctrine , which argues that all men are \" dead in trespasses and sins \" , and so apart from being resurrected from spiritual death to spiritual life , no-one chooses salvation alone . However , it must be distinguished from Arminianism , which also teaches that all men are \" dead in trespasses and sins \" , and could not respond to the gospel if God did not enable individuals to do so by His prevenient grace . Calvinists maintain that God selected certain individuals for salvation before the world began , before drawing them to faith in him and his son , Jesus . In support of this , they maintain the interpretation of as Jesus stating the necessity of men being drawn to him as pre-ordained by God before they believe in him , and that only those pre-ordained for belief in him by God are drawn to him . Calvinists also use their interpretation of and in the writings of the apostle Paul as indication that God chose believers in Christ before the world was created , not based upon foreseen faith , but based upon his sovereign decision to save whomever he pleased to save . The doctrine of Perseverance of the Saints is distinct from the doctrine of Assurance , which describes how a person may first be sure that they have obtained salvation and an inheritance in the promises of the Bible including eternal life . The Westminster Confession of Faith covers Perseverance of the Saints in chapter 17 , and Assurance of Grace and Salvation in chapter 18 . Perseverance of the Saints is also distinct from the doctrine of Eternal security , the former indicating security of sanctification/condition while the latter indicates security of ( forensic ) justification/salvation . History Church Father Augustine of Hippo taught that some of those whom God chooses to save by regeneration through water baptism are given , in addition to the gift of faith , a gift of perseverance ( ) which enables them to continue to believe , and precludes the possibility of falling away . He developed this doctrine in ( CE ) , explaining why some regenerated infants persevere in faith and good works , while others fall away from the faith . Perseverance of the saints also predates Calvin in the teachings of Jovinian . The traditional Calvinist doctrine is one of the five points of Calvinism that were defined at the Synod of Dort during the Quinquarticular Controversy with the Arminian Remonstrants , who objected to the general predestinarian scheme of Calvinism . Arminianism teaches that salvation is conditioned on faith , therefore perseverance of the saints is also conditioned . The traditional Calvinist doctrine of perseverance is articulated in the Canons of Dort ( chapter 5 ) , the Westminster Confession of Faith ( chapter XVII ) , the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith ( chapter 17 ) , and may also be found in other Reformed Confessions . Nonetheless , the doctrine is most often mentioned in connection with other salvific schemes and is not a major focus of Reformed systematic theology . It is , however , seen by many as the necessary consequence of Calvinism and of trusting in the promises of God . Traditional Calvinism voiced its opposition to carnal Christianity and the non-traditional Calvinist doctrine in the recent controversy over Lordship salvation . Reformed doctrine The Reformed tradition has consistently seen the doctrine of perseverance as a natural consequence to predestination . According to Calvinists , since God has drawn the elect to faith in Christ by regenerating their hearts and convincing them of their sins , and thus saving their souls by his own work and power , it naturally follows that they will be kept by the same power to the end . Since God has made satisfaction for the sins of the elect , they can no longer be condemned for them , and through the help of the Holy Spirit , they must necessarily persevere as Christians and in the end be saved . Calvinists believe this is what Peter is teaching in when he says that true believers are \" kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation \" . Outside Calvinist denominations , this doctrine is widely considered to be flawed . Calvinists also believe that all who are born again and justified before God necessarily and inexorably proceed to sanctification . Failure to proceed to sanctification in their view is considered by some as evidence that the person in question was never truly saved to begin with . Proponents of this doctrine distinguish between an action and the consequences of an action , and suggest that after God has regenerated someone , the person \\'s will has been changed , that \" old things pass away \" and \" all things are become new \" , as it is written in the Bible , and he or she will as a consequence persevere in the faith . The Westminster Confession of Faith defined perseverance as follows : This definition does not deny the possibility of failings in one \\'s Christian experience , because the Confession also says : Theologian Charles Hodge summarizes the thrust of the Calvinist doctrine : On a practical level , Calvinists do not claim to know who is elect and who is not , and the only guide they have is the verbal testimony and good works ( or \" fruit \" ) of each individual . Any who \" fall away \" are assumed not to have been truly converted to begin with , though Calvinists do not claim to know with certainty who did and who did not persevere . Essentially , Reformed doctrine believes that the same God whose power justified the Christian believer is also at work in the continued sanctification of that believer . As says , \" It is God who is at work in you , both to will and work for His good pleasure \" ; thus , all who are truly born again are kept by God the Father for Jesus Christ , and can neither totally nor finally fall from the state of grace , but will persevere in their faith to the end , and be eternally saved . While Reformed theologians acknowledge that true believers at times will fall into sin , they maintain that a real believer in Jesus Christ can not abandon one \\'s own personal faith to the dominion of sin , basing their understanding on key scriptural passages such as Christ \\'s words , \" By their fruit you will know them \" and \" He that endures to the end will be saved . \" Similarly , a passage in 1 John says , \" This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are : Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God . \" The person who has truly been made righteous in Jesus Christ did not simply have faith at some point in life , but continues to live in that faith ( ) . This view understands that the security of believers is inseparable from their perseverance in the faith . Free Grace doctrine The Free Grace or non-traditional Calvinist doctrine has been espoused by Charles Stanley , Norman Geisler , Zane C . Hodges , Bill Bright , and others . This view , like the traditional Calvinist view , emphasizes that people are saved purely by an act of divine grace that does not depend at all on the deeds of the individual , and for that reason ( in contrary to Calvinism ) insists that nothing the person can do can affect their salvation . In the Free Grace view , saints can fall away ( stop persevering ) in both conduct and faith yet remain eternally secure . Evangelical criticism Both traditional Calvinism and traditional Arminianism reject Free Grace theology . The former believes Free Grace to be a distorted form of Calvinism which maintains the permanency of salvation ( or properly speaking , justification ) while radically divorcing the ongoing work of sanctification from that justification . Reformed theology has uniformly asserted that \" no man is a Christian who does not feel some special love for righteousness \" ( Institutes ) , and therefore sees Free Grace theology , which allows for the concept of a \" carnal Christian \" or even an \" unbelieving Christian \" , as a form of radical antinomianism . Arminianism , which has always believed true believers can give themselves completely over to sin , has also rejected the Free Grace view for the opposite reason of Calvinism : namely , that the view denies the classical Arminian doctrine that true Christians can lose their salvation by denouncing their faith . Free Grace theology maintains the middle ground of the permanency of salvation seen in Calvinism with the maintained belief that a believer can still give up their faith , choosing to live a life of unbelief . Both Calvinists and Arminians appeal to Biblical passages such as ( \" By this gospel you are saved , if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you . Otherwise , you have believed in vain \" ) , ( \" We have come to share in Christ if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first \" ) , ( \" faith without works is dead \" ) , and ( \" If we endure , we will also reign with him . If we disown him , he will also disown us \" ) . Biblical evidence In addition to fitting neatly in the overarching Calvinist soteriology , Reformed and Free Grace advocates alike find specific support for the doctrine in various passages from the Bible : : \" Being born again , not of corruptible seed , but of incorruptible , by the word of God , which liveth and abideth for ever . \" : \" Truly , truly , I say to you , whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life . He does not come into judgment , but has passed from death to life . \" : Jesus said to them , \" I am the bread of life ; whoever comes to me shall not hunger , and whoever believes in me shall never thirst . But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe . All that the Father gives me will come to me , and whoever comes to me I will never cast out . \" : \" My sheep hear my voice , and I know them , and they follow me . I give them eternal life , and they will never perish , and no one will snatch them out of my hand . My Father , who has given them to me , is greater than all , and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father ’ s hand . \" : Since , therefore , we have now been justified by his blood , much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God . : There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus . : Who shall separate us from the love of Christ ? Shall tribulation , or distress , or persecution , or famine , or nakedness , or danger , or sword ? : For I am sure that neither death nor life , nor angels nor rulers , nor things present nor things to come , nor powers , nor height nor depth , nor anything else in all creation , will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord . : For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable . : For we have come to share in Christ , if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end . : They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have continued with us . But they went out , that it might become plain that they all are not of us . : But by the grace of God I am what I am , and his grace toward me was not in vain . On the contrary , I worked harder than any of them , though it was not I , but the grace of God that is with me . : ... that is , in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself , not counting their trespasses against them , and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation . : But God , being rich in mercy , because of the great love with which he loved us , even when we were dead in our trespasses , made us alive together with Christ — by grace you have been saved — and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus ... : And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God , by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption . : And I am sure of this , that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ . : ... which is why I suffer as I do . But I am not ashamed , for I know whom I have believed , and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me . : ... if we are faithless , he remains faithful — for he can not deny himself . : Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus , the great shepherd of the sheep , by the blood of the eternal covenant , equip you with everything good that you may do his will , working in us that which is pleasing in his sight , through Jesus Christ , to whom be glory forever and ever . Amen . : No one born of God makes a practice of sinning , for God ’ s seed abides in him , and he can not keep on sinning because he has been born of God . : For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world . And this is the victory that has overcome the world — our faith . Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God ? : In him you also , when you heard the word of truth , the gospel of your salvation , and believed in him , were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit , who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it , to the praise of his glory . : \" ... since you have given him authority over all flesh , to give eternal life to all whom you have given him . \" ( 12 ) \" While I was with them , I kept them in your name , which you have given me . I have guarded them , and not one of them has been lost except the son of destruction , that the Scripture might be fulfilled . \" : ... even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you — so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift , as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ , who will sustain you to the end , guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ . : Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely , and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ . He who calls you is faithful ; he will surely do it . : But the Lord is faithful . He will establish you and guard you against the evil one . : ... he entered once for all into the holy places , not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood , thus securing an eternal redemption . : Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ! According to his great mercy , he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead , to an inheritance that is imperishable , undefiled , and unfading , kept in heaven for you , who by God ’ s power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time . : And this is the testimony , that God gave us eternal life , and this life is in his Son . Whoever has the Son has life ; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life . I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life . : So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose , he guaranteed it with an oath , so that by two unchangeable things , in which it is impossible for God to lie , we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us . We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul , a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain ... : I will give them one heart and one way , that they may fear me forever , for their own good and the good of their children after them . I will make with them an everlasting covenant , that I will not turn away from doing good to them . And I will put the fear of me in their hearts , that they may not turn from me . : Listen to me , O house of Jacob , all the remnant of the house of Israel , who have been borne by me from before your birth , carried from the womb ; even to your old age I am he , and to gray hairs I will carry you . I have made , and I will bear ; I will carry and will save . : But it is not as though the word of God has failed . For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel , and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring , but \" Through Isaac shall your offspring be named . \" This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God , but the children of the promise are counted as offspring . : Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed ; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand . : Love the LORD , all you his saints ! The LORD preserves the faithful but abundantly repays the one who acts in pride . : For the LORD loves justice ; he will not forsake his saints . They are preserved forever , but the children of the wicked shall be cut off . : Cast your burden on the LORD , and he will sustain you ; he will never permit the righteous to be moved . : They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion , which can not be removed , but abideth for ever . As the mountains are round about Jerusalem , so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever . Counter evidence Calvinist interpretations Some Calvinists admit that their interpretation is not without difficulties . One apparent consequence is that not all who \" have shared in the Holy Spirit \" are necessarily regenerate . This is a consequence Calvinists are willing to accept since the Bible also says that King Saul had the \" Spirit of God \" in some sense and even prophesied by it , but was not a follower of God . Calvin says , God indeed favors none but the elect alone with the Spirit of regeneration , and that by this they are distinguished from the reprobate… But I can not admit that all this is any reason why he should not grant the reprobate also some taste of his grace , why he should not irradiate their minds with some sparks of his light , why he should not give them some perception of his goodness , and in some sort engrave his word on their hearts . Some challenge the Calvinist doctrine based on their interpretation of the admonishments in the book of Hebrews , including several passages in the Book of Hebrews , but especially and . The former passage says of those \" who have once been enlightened , who have tasted the heavenly gift , and have shared in the Holy Spirit , and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come \" that , when they \" fall away \" , they can not be \" restored to repentance . \" The latter passage says that if one continues in sin , \" no sacrifice for sins \" remains for that person but \" only a fearful expectation of judgment . \" The author of Hebrews predicts grave punishment for one who \" has trampled the Son of God under foot , who has treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him , and who has insulted the Spirit of grace . \" The debate over these passages centers around the identity of the persons in question . While opponents of perseverance identify the persons as Christian believers , Calvinists suggest several other options : These passages are not clear enough to describe a regenerate person ( or \" true Christian \" ) , and thus they do not describe the situation of a true believer . Instead , the persons in question may well have been part of the church community and had the advantages concomitant with that membership ( citing the benefits of being a member of the covenant community in the Old Testament mentioned in and ) without being truly \" saved \" —as with King Saul . In an effort to corroborate this interpretation , they also cite such passages as : \" They went out from us , but they were not of us ; for if they had been of us , they would have continued with us . But they went out , that it might become plain that they all are not of us . \" However , this interpretation also has difficulty with verse 6 which states that it is impossible \" if they shall fall away , to renew them again unto repentance . \" These passages can refer to a regenerate person , but what is described is not a loss of salvation ( because they believe other scriptural passages say that this is impossible ) , but instead a loss of eternal ( or millennial ) rewards . The author is employing hyperbole to effect positive change in his audience \\'s behavior , possibly referring to Christians leaving fellowship in . The passages refer to Jewish Christians who were reverting to Judaism . The passages refer to the rejection of the covenant community as a whole , not individual believers ( Verbrugge ) . Passages put forth against the Calvinist doctrine Some other passages put forth against the Calvinist doctrine include : : Note then the kindness and the severity of God : severity toward those who have fallen , but God ’ s kindness to you , provided you continue in his kindness . Otherwise you too will be cut off . : Every athlete exercises self-control in all things . They do it to receive a perishable wreath , but we an imperishable . So I do not run aimlessly ; I do not box as one beating the air . But I discipline my body and keep it under control , lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified . : Therefore , whoever thinks he is standing secure should take care not to fall . : You are severed from Christ , you who would be justified by the law ; you have fallen away from grace . : For if , after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ , they are again entangled in them and overcome , the last state has become worse for them than the first . : And you , who once were alienated and hostile in mind , doing evil deeds , he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death , in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him , if indeed you continue in the faith , stable and steadfast , not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard , which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven , and of which I , Paul , became a minister . : Take heed , brethren , lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief , in departing from the living God . For we are made partakers of Christ , if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end . : \" Wake up , and strengthen what remains and is about to die , for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God . Remember , then , what you received and heard . Keep it , and repent . If you will not wake up , I will come like a thief , and you will not know at what hour I will come against you . Yet you have still a few names in Sardis , people who have not soiled their garments , and they will walk with me in white , for they are worthy . The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments , and I will never blot his name out of the book of life . I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels . \" In general , proponents of the doctrine of perseverance interpret such passages , which urge the church community to persevere in the faith but seem to indicate that some members of the community might fall away , as encouragement to persevere rather than divine warnings . That is , they view the prophets and apostles as writing \" from the human perspective \" , in which the members of the elect are unknowable and all should \" work out [ their ] own salvation \" and \" make [ their ] calling and election sure , \" rather than \" from the divine perspective \" , in which those who will persevere , according to Calvinism , are well known . The primary objection to this Calvinist approach is that it might equally be said that these difficult passages are intended to be divine warnings to believers who do not persevere , rather than a revealing of God \\'s perpetual grace towards believers . Interpretations of Hebrews 6:4–6 is said by some to be one of the Bible \\'s most difficult passages to interpret , and may present the most difficulty for proponents of the Eternal Security of the Believer . The passage is understood by some to mean that \" falling away \" from an active commitment to Christ may cause one to lose their salvation , after they have attained salvation either according to the Reformed or Free Grace theology . However , numerous conservative Bible scholars do not believe the passage refers to a Christian losing genuinely attained salvation . One interpretation holds that this passage is written not about Christians but about unbelievers who are convinced of the basic truths of the gospel but who have not placed their faith in Jesus Christ as Savior . They are intellectually persuaded but spiritually uncommitted . The phrase \" once enlightened \" may refer to some level of instruction in biblical truth . \" …have tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come , and then have fallen away… \" could be a reference to those who have tasted the truth about Jesus but , not having come all the way to faith , fall away from even the revelation they have been given . The tasting of truth is not enough to keep them from falling away from it . They must come all the way to Christ in complete repentance and faith . A second interpretation holds that this passage is written about Christians , and that the phrases \" partakers of the Holy Ghost \" , \" enlightened \" , and \" tasted of the heavenly gift \" are all descriptions of true believers . Some passages , including and , are taken by some to suggest that a \\'saved \\' person can lose their salvation . Others see them as severe warnings which do not include the loss of salvation , but in many cases fiery judgment for those who were never saved and only playing at Christianity . A third interpretation maintains that Hebrews 6:4-8 describes only those who temporarily backslide in their faith , and does not address the issue of the loss of salvation . This interpretation is well presented in an exegetical outline of the book of Hebrews found on the website of Ariel Ministries , a Messianic-Jewish organization founded by Arnold Fruchtenbaum in 1971 . Some advocates of this position claim that the passage says that those who experience the five spiritual privileges mentioned in verses 4 and 5 can not lose their salvation and then be saved again later ( i.e . be \" restore [ d ] ... again to repentance \" ) because that would require a recrucifixion of Christ ( v . 6 ) , thus rendering ineffectual his initial propitiatory death , putting Him to open shame . This position maintains that the Greek word used for \" repentance \" in verse 6 refers to \" salvation repentance \" rather than \" repentance to restore fellowship . \" Supporters of this interpretation also cite the overall context of chapters 5 and 6 as evidence for their position : chapter 5 concludes with a rebuke to the recipients of the epistle for wasting time , dawdling in spiritual infancy , while chapter 6 begins with an exhortation not to continue wasting time as spiritual infants , but to \" press on to maturity . \" Biblical theologian David DeSilva writes that \" Many interpreters are driven to treat this passage as either a \\'problem passage \\' or crux for a specific theological or ideological conviction . \" DeSilva agrees that the passage can not refer to \" saved \" individuals since the author of Hebrews views salvation as the deliverance and reward that awaits the faithful at the return of Christ . Those who have trusted God \\'s promise and Jesus \\' mediation are \" those who are about to inherit salvation \\' which comes at Christ \\'s second coming . He argues that the passage refers to unbelievers who have received God \\'s gifts and have benefited from God \\'s grace , yet still remained skeptics . Biblical theologian B . J . Oropeza suggests that those who read and listened to this letter had experienced persecutions in the past , and the author of Hebrews acknowledges that some church members had become apostates . The several terms in Hebrews 6:1–6 are to stress that these former apostates had experienced conversion-initiation ; there is no place in the New Testament , for example , where unbelievers or fake Christians explicitly share in the Holy Spirit as did these former members . The author of Hebrews thus rhetorically stresses that despite all these benefits and experiences that confirmed their conversion , they fell away ; and now he warns the hearers of this message that in their present state of malaise and neglecting church gatherings , the same thing could happen to them . The consequences of apostasy without restoration are portrayed as dire ( ; ; ) . Objections The primary objection put against Perseverance of the Saints is that its teaching may lead believers to sin freely , if they know they can never lose their salvation , without fear of eternal consequences . Traditional Calvinists see this charge as being justly leveled against the Free Grace doctrine , which does not see sanctification as a necessary component of salvation , and in the controversy over Lordship salvation , traditional Calvinists argued against the proponents of the Free Grace doctrine . Traditional Calvinists , and many other non-Calvinist evangelicals , posit that a truly converted heart will necessarily follow after God and live in accordance with his precepts , though perfection is not achievable , struggles with sin will continue , and some temporary \" backsliding \" may occur . Arminian view The central tenet of the Arminian view is that although believers are preserved from all external forces that might attempt to separate them from God , they have the free will to separate themselves from God . Although God will not change his mind about a believer \\'s salvation , a believer can willingly repudiate faith ( either by express denial of faith or by continued sinful activity combined with an unwillingness to repent ) . In this manner , salvation is conditional , not unconditional as Calvinism teaches . Traditional Calvinists do not dispute that salvation requires faithfulness . However , Calvinists contend that God is sovereign and can not permit a true believer to depart from faith . Arminians argue that God is sufficiently sovereign and omnipotent to embed free will into humanity , so that true Christians may exercise free will and fall away from the saving grace they once possessed . Roman Catholic view The 22nd Canon of the Decree Concerning Justification of the Council of Trent ( Sixth Session , 13 January 1547 ) has this to say regarding perseverance : \" If anyone says that the one justified either can without the special help of God persevere in the justice received , or that with that help he can not , let him be anathema . \" In this canon , the Council reaffirmed that perseverance absolutely requires divine help—a divine help that can not fail . Respecting these parameters , Catholics can have a variety of views as regards final perseverance . On questions of predestination , Catholic scholars may be broadly characterized as either Molinists or Thomists . The views of the latter are similar to those of Calvinists , in that they understand final perseverance to be a gift applied by God to the regenerated that will assuredly lead them to ultimate salvation . They differ from Calvinists in but one respect : whether God permits men to \" fall away \" after regeneration . Thomists affirm that God can permit men to come to regeneration without giving them the special gift of divine perseverance , so that they do fall away . Calvinists , by contrast , deny that an individual can fall away if they are truly regenerate . Lutheran view Like both Calvinist camps , confessional Lutherans view the work of salvation as monergistic in that \" the natural [ that is , corrupted and divinely unrenewed ] powers of man can not do anything or help towards salvation \" , and Lutherans go further along the same lines as the Free Grace advocates to say that the recipient of saving grace need not cooperate with it . Hence , Lutherans believe that a true Christian - in this instance , a genuine recipient of saving grace - can lose his or her salvation , \" [ b ] ut the cause is not as though God were unwilling to grant grace for perseverance to those in whom He has begun the good work… [ but that these persons ] wilfully turn away… \" Free Grace view Free grace advocates criticize persevarance of the saints , because they claim that persevarance puts assurance in good works . Free grace advocates believe that believers are promised eternal security , but that God does not promise persevarance .

References External links', 'The knock-knock joke is a type of audience-participatory joke cycle , typically ending with a pun . Knock-knock jokes are primarily seen as children \\'s jokes , though there are exceptions . The scenario is of a person knocking on the front door to a house . The teller of the joke says , \" Knock , knock ! \" ; the recipient responds , \" Who \\'s there ? \" The teller gives a name ( such as \" Noah \" ) , a description ( such as \" Police \" ) , or something that purports to be a name ( such as \" Needle \" ) . The other person then responds by asking the caller \\'s surname ( \" Noah who ? \" / \" Police who ? \" / \" Needle who ? \" ) , to which the joke-teller delivers a pun involving the name ( \" place I can spend the night ? \" / \" let me in—it \\'s cold out here ! \" / \" help with the groceries ! \" ) . The formula of the joke is usually followed strictly , though there are cases where it is subverted . History A possible source of the joke is William Shakespeare \\'s Macbeth ; first performed in 1606 . In Act 2 , Scene 3 the porter is very hungover from the previous night . During his monologue he uses \" Knock , knock ! Who \\'s there \" as a refrain while he is speaking : Writing in the Oakland Tribune , Merely McEvoy recalled a style of joke from around 1900 where a person would ask a question such as \" Do you know Arthur ? \" , the unsuspecting listener responding with \" Arthur who ? \" and the joke teller answering \" Arthurmometer ! \" A variation of the format in the form of a children \\'s game was described in 1929 . In the game of Buff , a child with a stick thumps it on the ground , and the dialogue ensues : In 1936 , Bob Dunn authored the book Knock Knock : Featuring Enoch Knox , and he is regarded by some as having invented the modern knock-knock joke . In 1936 , the standard knock-knock joke format was used in a newspaper advertisement . That joke was : A 1936 Associated Press newspaper article said that \" What \\'s This ? \" had given way to \" Knock Knock ! \" as a favorite parlor game . The article also said that \" knock knock \" seemed to be an outgrowth of making up sentences with difficult words , an old parlor favorite . A popular joke of 1936 was \" Knock knock . Who \\'s there ? Edward Rex . Edward Rex who ? the Coronation . \" Fred Allen \\'s 30 December 1936 radio broadcast included a humorous wrapup of the year \\'s least important events , including a supposed interview with the man who \" invented a negative craze \" on 1 April : \" Ramrod Dank ... the first man to coin a Knock Knock . \" The format is so well known that it can be changed to humorous effect . This is shown in this circa 1980 joke : Knock , knock . Who \\'s there ? Interrupting Cow . Interrupting Cow who ? ( of course interrupted by unexpected and loud moo ! ) . Other variations feature an Interrupting pig , Interrupting duck and other equally bothersome animals . Popular culture \" Knock knock \" was the catchphrase of music hall performer Wee Georgie Wood , who was recorded in 1936 saying it in a radio play , but he simply used the words as a reference to his surname and did not use it as part of the well-known joke formula . The format was well known in the UK and US in the 1950s and 1960s before falling out of favor . It then enjoyed a renaissance after the jokes became a regular part of the badinage on Rowan & Martin \\'s Laugh-In . References Joke cycles Puns Doors', 'A gamer is a proactive hobbist who plays interactive games , especially video games , tabletop role-playing games , and skill-based card games , and who plays for usually long periods of time . Some gamers are competitive , meaning they routinely compete in some games for money , prizes , awards or the mere pleasure of competition and overcoming obstacles . In some countries such as the UK and Australia , the term \" gaming \" can refer to legalized gambling , which can take both traditional and digital forms , through online gambling . There are many different gamer communities around the world . Since the advent of the Internet , many communities take the form of Internet forums or YouTube or Twitch virtual communities , as well as in-person social clubs . Originally a hobby , it has evolved into a profession for some . In 2021 , there were an estimated 3.24 billion gamers across the globe . Etymology The term gamer originally meant gambler , and has been in use since at least 1422 , when the town laws of Walsall , England , referred to \" any dice-player , carder , tennis player , or other unlawful gamer \" . However , this description has not been adopted in the United States , where it became associated with other pastimes . In the US , they made their appearance as wargames . Wargames were originally created as a military and strategy tool . When Dungeons & Dragons was released , it was originally marketed as a wargame , but later was described by its creators as a role-playing game . They too called their players gamers and this is where the word changed definition from someone who gambles to someone who plays board games and/or video games . Categories In the United States as of 2018 , 28 % of gamers are under 18 , 29 % are 18–35 , 20 % are 36-49 and 23 % are over 50 . In the UK as of 2014 , 29 % are under 18 , 32 % are 18-35 and 39 % are over 36 . According to Pew Research Center , 49 % of adults have played a video game at some point in their life and those who have are more likely to let their children or future children play . Those who play video games regularly are split roughly equally between male and female , but men are more likely to call themselves a \\'Gamer . \\' As of 2019 , the average gamer is 33 years old . Female gamer/gamer girl A female gamer , or gamer girl or girl gamer , is any female who regularly engages in playing video games . According to a study conducted by the Entertainment Software Association in 2009 , 40 % of the game playing population is female , and women 18 or older comprise 34 % of all gamers . Also , the percentage of women playing online had risen to 43 % , up 4 % from 2004 . The same study shows that 48 % of game purchasers are female . According to a 2015 Pew survey , 6 % of women in the United States identify as gamers , compared to 15 % of men , and 48 % of women and 50 % of men play video games . Usage of the term \" girl gamer \" is controversial . Some critics have advocated use of the label as a reappropriated term , while others see it as nondescriptive or perpetuating the minority position of female gamers . Some critics of the term believe there is no singular definition of a female gamer and that they are as diverse as any other group . However it is generally understood that the term \" girl gamer \" implies that it is a girl who plays video games . Psychology Shigeru Miyamoto says that \" I think that first a game needs a sense of accomplishment . And you have to have a sense that you have done something , so that you get that sense of satisfaction of completing something . \" Gaming is a form of escapism . Hideo Kojima states that \" If the player is n\\'t tricked into believing that the world is real , then there \\'s no point in making the game . \" In April 2020 , researchers found that top gamers shared the same mental toughness as olympian athletes . Escapism in gaming is a major factor in why individuals have falling in love with gaming . This idea of being in another world while gaming has become very common with gamers , these video games create a new world where these gamers feel they fit in and can control what is going on . Types and demographics Sexes Although roughly the same number of men and women play games , the stereotype of a gamer is one that is predominantly male . A justification sometimes given for this is that while many women occasionally play games , they should not be considered \" true \" gamers because they tend to play games that are more casual and require less skill than men . This stereotype is perpetuated by the fact that at a professional level , most of the teams competing are composed of men , while female gamers of moderate skill are rendered invisible . Gaymer A gaymer , or gay gamer , is a person within the group of people who identify themselves as LGBT ( gay , bisexual , lesbian , or transgender ) and have an active interest in video games . This demographic has been the subject of two large surveys , one in 2006 , which noted the level of prejudice that gaymers endure , and another in 2009 , focusing on the content that gaymers expect in video games . The gaymer community provides a \" safe place \" for LGBT gamers apart from the isolation they feel from both the heteronormative gaming community and the gay community . They also believe that as homosexuality in video games increase , there will be an increased normalization of homosexuality in general . Hamed Hosseini stated that \" gaymers are the future of video games \" at Valve \\'s gaming convention . Dedication spectrum It is common for games media , games industry analysts , and academics to divide gamers into broad behavioral categories . These categories are sometimes separated by level of dedication to gaming , sometimes by primary type of game played , and sometimes by a combination of those and other factors . There is no general consensus on the definitions or names of these categories , though many attempts have been made to formalize them . An overview of these attempts and their common elements follows . Newbie : ( commonly shortened to \" noob \" , \" n00b \" , or \" newb \" ) A slang term for a novice or newcomer to a certain game , or to gaming in general . Casual gamer : The term often used for gamers who primarily play casual games , but can also refer to gamers who play less frequently than other gamers . Casual gamers may play games designed for ease of gameplay , or play more involved games in short sessions , or at a slower pace than hardcore gamers . The types of game that casual gamers play vary , and they are less likely to own a dedicated video game console . Notable examples of casual games include The Sims and Nintendogs . Casual gamer demographics vary greatly from those of other video gamers , as the typical casual gamer is older and more predominantly female . \" Fitness gamer \" s , who play motion-based exercise games , are also seen as casual gamers . Core gamer : ( also mid-core ) A player with a wider range of interests than a casual gamer and is more likely to enthusiastically play different types of games , but without the amount of time spent and sense of competition of a hardcore gamer . The mid-core gamer enjoys games but may not finish every game they buy and is a target consumer . Former Nintendo president Satoru Iwata stated that they designed the Wii U to cater to core gamers who are in between the casual and hardcore categories . A number of theories have been presented regarding the rise in popularity of mid-core games . James Hursthouse , the founder of Roadhouse Interactive , credits the evolution of devices towards tablets and touch-screen interfaces , whereas Jon Radoff of Disruptor Beam compares the emergence of mid-core games to similar increases in media sophistication that have occurred in media such as television . Hardcore gamer : Ernest Adams and Scott Kim have proposed classification metrics to distinguish \" hardcore gamers \" from casual gamers , emphasizing action , competition , complexity , gaming communities , and staying abreast of developments in hardware and software . Others have attempted to draw the distinction based primarily on which platforms a gamer prefers , or to decry the entire concept of delineating casual from hardcore as divisive and vague . Professional gamer Professional gamers generally play video games for prize money or salaries . Usually , such individuals deeply study the game in order to master it and usually to play in competitions like Esports . A pro gamer may also be another type of gamer , such as a hardcore gamer , if he or she meets the additional criteria for that gamer type . In countries of Asia , particularly South Korea and China , professional gamers and teams are sponsored by large companies and can earn more than 100,000 a year . In 2006 Major League Gaming contracted several Halo 2 players including Tom \" Tsquared \" Taylor and members of Team Final Boss with US $ 250,000 yearly deals . Many professional gamers find that competitions are able to provide a substantial amount of money to support themselves . However , oftentimes , these popular gamers can locate even more lucrative options . One such option is found through online live streaming of their games . These gamers who take time out of their lives to stream make money from their stream , usually through sponsorships with large companies looking for a new audience or donations from their fans just trying to support their favorite streamer . Live streaming often occurs through popular websites such as Twitch , Hitbox , Mixer and YouTube . Professional gamers with particularly large followings can often bring their fan bases to watch them play on live streams . An example of this is shown through retired professional League of Legends player , Wei Han-Dong also known as \" CaoMei \" . Han-Dong had decided to retire from Esports due to his ability to acquire substantially higher pay through live streaming . His yearly salary through the Battle Flag TV live streaming service increased his pay to roughly $ 800,000 yearly . Live streaming can be seen by many as a truly lucrative way for professional gamers to make money in a way that can also lessen the pressure in the competitive scene.We are seeing a rapid increase in the young video game players wanting to be Professional Gamers instead of the \" pro athlete \" . The career path of becoming a professional gamer is open for anyone any race , gender , and backgroundA Gamer is a person who plays video games for long periods of time , on gaming consoles ranging from PC \\'s to Xbox \\'s and Playstation \\'s . In countries like the UK and Australia , gaming stands for legalized gambling . The gaming community now has developed at a much faster rate and now is being considered \" esports \" . These more serious gamers are what you would consider \" Professional Gamers \" , these are the individuals that take the average everyday gaming much more seriously and profit from how they perform . Retrogamer A retro gamer is a gamer who prefers to play , and often enough collect , retro games—older video games and arcade games . They may also be called classic gamers or old-school gamers , which are terms that are more prevalent in the United States . The games are played on the original hardware , on modern hardware via emulation , or on modern hardware via ports or compilations ( though those \\'in the hobby \\' tend toward original hardware and emulation ) . Classification in taxonomies A number of taxonomies have been proposed which classify gamer types and the aspects they value in games . The Bartle taxonomy of player types classifies gamers according to their preferred activities within the game : Achievers , who like to gain points and overall succeed within the game parameters , collecting all rewards and game badges . Explorers , who like to discover all areas within the game , including hidden areas and glitches , and expose all game mechanics . Socializers , who prefer to play games for the social aspect , rather than the actual game itself . Beaters , who thrive on competition with other players . Completionists , who are combinations of the Achiever and Explorer types . They complete every aspect of the game ( main story , side quests , achievements ) while finding every secret within it . The MDA framework describes various aspects of the game regarding the basic rules and actions ( Mechanics ) , how they build up during game to develop the gameplay ( Dynamics ) , and what emotional response they convey to the player ( Aesthetics ) . The described esthetics are further classified as Sensation , Fantasy , Narrative , Challenge , Fellowship , Discovery , Expression and Submission . Jesse Schell extends this classification with Anticipation , Schadenfreude , Gift giving , Humour , Possibility , Pride , Purification , Surprise , Thrill , Perseverance and Wonder , and proposes a number of generalizations of differences between how males and females play . Avatar Creating an avatar sets the stage of a player becoming an avatar ; it is the first interaction that a potential player must make to identify themselves among the gaming community . An avatar , username , game name , alias , gamer tag , screen name , or handle is a name ( usually a pseudonym ) adopted by a video gamer , used as a main preferred identification to the gaming community . Usage of user names is often most prevalent in games with online multiplayer support , or at electronic sport conventions . While some well-known gamers only go by their online handle , a number have adopted to using their handle within their real name typically presented as a middle name , such as Tyler \" Ninja \" Blevins or Jay \" sinatraa \" Won . Similarly , a clan tag is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a clan . Clans are generally a group of gamers who play together as a team against other clans . They are most commonly found in online multi-player games in which one team can face off against another . Clans can also be formed to create loosely based affiliations perhaps by all being fans of the same game or merely gamers who have close personal ties to each other . A team tag is a prefix or suffix added to a name to identify that the gamer is in a team . Teams are generally sub-divisions within the same clan and are regarded within gaming circuits as being a purely competitive affiliation . These gamers are usually in an online league such as the Cyberathlete Amateur League ( C.A.L . ) and their parent company the Cyberathlete Professional League ( C.P.L . ) where all grouped players were labeled as teams and not clans . Clans and guilds A clan , squad or guild is a group of players that form , usually under an informal \\'leader \\' or administrator . Clans are often formed by gamers with similar interests ; many clans or guilds form to connect an \\'offline \\' community that might otherwise be isolated due to geographic , cultural or physical barriers . Some clans are composed of professional gamers , who enter competitive tournaments for cash or other prizes ; most , however , are simply groups of like-minded players that band together for a mutual purpose ( for example , a gaming-related interest or social group ) . Identity The identity of being a gamer is partly self-determination and partly performativity of characteristics society expects a gamer to embody . These expectations include not only a high level of dedication to playing games , but also preferences for certain types of games , as well as an interest in game-related paraphernalia like clothing and comic books . According to Graeme Kirkpatrick , the \" true gamer \" is concerned first and foremost with gameplay . Escapist founder Alexander Macris says a gamer is an enthusiast with greater dedication to games than just playing them , similar in connotation to \" cinemaphile \" . People who play may not identify as gamers because they feel they do n\\'t play \" enough \" to qualify . Social stigma against games has influenced some women and minorities to distance themselves from the term \" gamer \" , even though they may play regularly . Notably , during the Gamergate Controversy that began in August 2014 , the gaming press responded to anger from gamers with numerous articles calling the gamer identity \" dead \" due to changing demographic shifts , despite continuing to use the term to attract advertisers . Demographics Games are stereotypically associated with young males , but the diversity of the audience has been steadily increasing over time . This stereotype exists even among a majority of women who play video games regularly . Among players using the same category of device ( e.g. , console or phone ) , patterns of play are largely the same between men and women . Diversity is driven in part by new hardware platforms . Expansion of the audience was catalyzed by Nintendo \\'s efforts to reach new demographics . Market penetration of smartphones with gaming capabilities further expanded the audience , since in contrast to consoles or high-end PCs , mobile phone gaming requires only devices that non-gamers are likely to already own . While 48 % of women in the United States report having played a video game , only 6 % identify as gamers , compared to 15 % of men who identify as gamers . This rises to 9 % among women aged 18–29 , compared to 33 % of men in that age group . Half of female PC gamers in the U.S . consider themselves to be core or hardcore gamers . Connotations of \" gamer \" with sexism on the fringe of gaming culture has caused women to be less willing to adopt the label . Racial minorities responding to Pew Research were more likely to describe themselves as gamers , with 19 % of Hispanics identifying as gamers , compared to 11 % of African-Americans and 7 % of whites . The competitive fighting game scene is noted as particularly racially diverse and tolerant . This is attributed to its origin in arcades , where competitors met face to face and the barrier to entry was merely a quarter . Only 4 % of those aged 50 and over identified as gamers . Casualization Casualization is a trend in video games towards simpler games appealing to larger audiences , especially women or the elderly . Some developers , hoping to attract a broader audience , simplify or remove aspects of gameplay in established genres and franchises . Compared to seminal titles like DOOM , more recent mass-market action games like the Call of Duty series are less sensitive to player choice or skill , approaching the status of interactive movies . The trend towards casual games is decried by some self-identified gamers who emphasize gameplay , meaning the activities that one undertakes in a game . According to Brendan Keogh , these are inherently masculine activities such as fighting and exerting dominance . He further says that games women prefer are more passive experiences , and male gamers deride the lack of interactivity in these games because of this association with femininity . Belying these trends , games including The Sims or Minecraft have some of the largest audiences in the industry while also being very complex . According to Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research , girls who play Minecraft are \" just as \\'hardcore \\' as the next guy over who plays Counter-Strike \" Dreunen says being in control of a game \\'s environment appeals equally to boys and girls . Leigh Alexander argued that appealing to women does not necessarily entail reduced difficulty or complexity .

A second Halfdan the Old is the purported great-grandfather of Ragnvald Eysteinsson . Halfdan the Old , ancestor of many lineages Hyndluljód The eddic poem Hyndluljód states in verses 14–16 : \" Of old the noblest of all was Áli , Before him Halfdan , foremost of Skjöldungs [ Skjǫldungar ] ; Famed were the battles the hero fought , To the corners of heaven his deeds were carried . \" Strengthened by Eymund [ Eymundr ] , the strongest of men , Sigtrygg [ Sigtryggr ] he slew with the ice-cold sword ; His bride was Álmveig [ Álmveigr ] , the best of women , And eighteen boys did Álmveig bear him . \" Hence come the Skjöldungs , hence the Skilfings , Hence the Ödlings [ Ǫðlingar ] , hence the Ynglings , Hence come the free-born , hence the high-born , The noblest of men that in Midgard dwell : And all are thy kinsmen , Óttar , thou fool ! \" Though Halfdan is himself called a Skjöldung in verse 14 , in verse 16 the Skjöldungs are named instead as one of the families that sprang from Halfdan \\'s marriage with Álmveig . Skáldskaparmál Snorri Sturluson explains in the Skáldskaparmál : There was a king named Halfdan the Old , who was most famous of all kings . He made a great sacrificial feast at mid-winter , and sacrificed to this end , that he might live three hundred years in his kingdom ; but he received these answers : he should not live more than the full life of a man , but for three hundred years there should be in his line no woman and no man who was not of great repute . He was a great warrior , and went on forays far and wide in the Eastern Regions : there he slew in single combat the king who was called Sigtrygg . Then he took in marriage that woman named Alvig the Wise , daughter of King Eymund of Hólmgard [ Hólmgarðr ] : they had eighteen sons , nine born at one birth . These were their names : the first , Thengil [ Thengill ] , who was called Thengil of Men ; the second , Ræsir ; the third , Gram [ Gramr ] ; the fourth , Gylfi ; the fifth , Hilmir ; the sixth , Jöfur [ Jǫfurr ] ; the seventh , Tyggi ; the eighth , Skyli or Skúli ; the ninth , Harri or Herra . These nine brothers became so famous in foraying that , in all records since , their names are used as titles of rank , even as the name of King or that of Jarl . They had no children , and all fell in battle . Snorri then gives examples from skaldic verse where these names are used as general terms for \\'lord \\' or \\'ruler \\' . The promise of three hundred years of no women among Halfdan \\'s descendants is paralleled in the story of Ríg-Jarl who has sons only but no daughters . See Ríg ( Norse god ) . None of the titles given here duplicate titles such as hersir , jarl , konungr , and dróttinn which appear in the Ríg account . Snorri continues : Halfdan and his wife had nine other sons also ; these were : Hildir , from whom the Hildings are come ; Nefir , from whom the Niflungs sprang ; Audi [ Auði ] , from whom the Ödlings [ Ǫðlingar ] are come ; Yngvi , from whom the Ynglings are descended ; Dag [ Dagr ] , from whom come the Döglings [ Dǫglingar ] ; Bragi , from whom the Bragnings are sprung ( that is the race of Halfdan the Generous ( Hálfdanr inn mildi ) ; Budli [ Buðli ] , from whom the Budlungs [ Buðlungar ] are come ( from the house of the Budlungs Atli and Brynhild [ Brynhildr ] descended ) ; the eighth was Lofdi [ Lofði ] , who was a great war-king ( that host who were called Lofdar [ Lofðar ] followed him ; his kindred are called Lofdungs [ Lofðungar ] , whence sprang Eylimi , Sigurd Fáfnir\\'s-bane \\'s mother \\'s sire ) ; the ninth , Sigar [ Sigarr ] , whence come the Siklings : that is the house of Siggeir [ Siggeirr ] , who was son-in-law of Völsung [ Vǫlsungr ] , —and the house of Sigar , who hanged Hagbard [ Hagbarðr ] . From the race of Hildings sprang Harald Red-beard [ Haraldr granrauði ] , mother \\'s father of Halfdan the Black [ Hálfdanr inn svarti ] . Of the Niflung \\'s house was Gjúki . Of the house of Ödlings , Kjár [ Kjárr ] . Of the house of the Ylfings was Eirík the Eloquent [ Eiríkr inn málspaki ] . The Skjöldungs and Skilfings mentioned in the Hyndluljód are missing here . The Ylfings are suddenly introduced at the end in a reference to Eirík the Eloquent yet are also not found among the nine families . Snorri then immediately mentions what seem to be intended as four famous houses not descended from Halfdan the Old : These also are illustrious royal houses : from Yngvi , the Ynglings are descended ; from Skjöld in Denmark , the Skjöldungs are come ; from Völsung in the land of Franks , those who are called Völsungs . One war-king was named Skelfir ; and his house is called the House of Skilfings : his kindred is in the Eastern Region . But Yngvi has been previously named as a son of Halfdan the Old and the Skjöldungs and Skilfings are counted among Halfdan \\'s descendants in the Hyndluljód . Snorri continues : These houses which were named but now have been used in skaldship for titles of rank . Snorri then quotes many skaldic verses which demonstrate this . Ættartolur Halfdan and his sons The Ættartolur , the genealogies appended to the Hversu Noregr byggdist in the Flatey Book introduce Halfdan the Old as the ruler of Ringiríki ( a territory including modern Ringerike and Valdres in Oppland ) . Halfdan is here the son of King Hring ( eponym of Ringeríki ) by the daughter of a sea-king named Vífil ( Vífill ) . Hring was son of Raum the Old ( eponym of Raumaríki ) by Hild ( Hildr ) the daughter Gudröd the Old ( Guðrǫðr inn gamli ) . Raum the Old was son of Nór ( Nórr ) ( the eponym of Norway ) . See Nór for further details about Nór and his ancestry and descendants . In his sacrifice Halfdan requested a lifetime of 300 years like that of his ancestor Snær . The form Tiggi appears instead of Tyggi in the list of the first nine sons . The list of the second nine sons has Skelfir instead of Yngvi and the form Næfil ( Næfill ) instead of Nefir . The order of the names is the same and it is explained that Hildir , Sigar , and Lofdi were war-kings ; Audi , Budli , and Næfil were sea-kings , while Dag , Skelfir , and Bragi remained on their lands . Döglings Dag married Thóra Heroes-mother ( Thóra drengjamóður ) who bore him nine sons , but only four are named : Óli , Ám ( Ámr ) , Jöfur , and Arngrím ( Arngrímr ) . Óli was father of Dag , father of Óleif ( Óleifr ) , father of Hring , father of Helgi , father of Sigurd Hart ( Sigurðr Hjǫrtr ) , father of Ragnhild ( Ragnhildr ) the mother of Harald Fairhair . Arngrím married Eyfura who bore him Angantýr the Berserk ( Angantýr berserkr ) . Angantýr \\'s story is most fully treated in the Hervarar saga . It also appears in part in book five of Saxo Grammaticus \\' Gesta Danorum and an account only the deaths of Angantýr and his eleven brothers appears in Arrow-Odd \\'s saga . Stanza 18 of the Hyndluljód reads : The mate of Dag was a mother of heroes [ drengja móður ] , Thóra , who bore him the bravest of fighters , Fradmar [ Fraðmarr ] and Gyrd [ Gyrðr ] and the Frekis [ Frekar ] twain , Ám and Jöfurmar [ Jǫfurmar ] , Álf the Old ; It is much to know , — wilt thou hear yet more ? The name Ám agrees with that of a son of Dag in the Ættartolur and Jöfurmar is probably identical with Jöfur of the Ættartolur . Fradmar , Gyrd , Álf the Old , and the two Frekis bring the total to seven . Adding the names Óli and Arngrím to this list from the Ættartolur brings the tally to nine , as the Ættartolur promised . This may be coincidental . It is odd that the Hyndluljód here leaves out the only two names for which the Hversu provides descendants . It is possible that the following stanzas of the Hyndluljód down to stanza 24 cover otherwise unknown members of the Dögling lineage since stanza 23 at least returns to the Dödlings , providing the names of the twelve sons of Arngrím and the following stanza tells of their birth to Arngrím and Eyfura . Áli mentioned in stanza 14 of the Hyndluljód ( quoted near the beginning of this article ) may be identical to Óli son of Dag mentioned in the Ættartolur . Bragnings Bragi the Old [ Bragi gamli ] was king of Valdres and father of Agnar , father of Álf , father of Eirík ( Eiríkr ) , father of Hild ( Hildr ) the mother of Halfdan the Generous , the father of Gudröd ( Guðrǫðr ) the Hunter , father of Halfdan the Black , father of Harald Fairhair . Skilfings or Skjöldungs Skilfir was king of Vörs ( Vǫrs , modern Voss in northern Hordaland in southwestern Norway . Skelfir was father of Skjöld ( Skjǫldr ) , father of Eirík , father of Alrek ( Alrekr ) , father of Eirík the Eloquent , father of Alrek the Bold ( Alrekr inn frækni ) , father of Víkar ( Víkarr ) , father of Vatnar ( Vatnarr ) , father of two sons : Ímald ( Ímaldr ) and Eirík , this Eirik being father of Gyda ( Gyða ) who was one of the wives of Harald Fairhair . They were called the Skilfing lineage or Skjöldung lineage . For commentary on this lineage and variant traditions on those listed here as belonging to it see Scylfing and Víkar . Hildings Hildir was father of Hildibrand ( Hildibrandr ) , father of Vígbrand ( Vígbrandr ) , father of Hildir and Herbrand ( Herbrandr ) . Herbrand was father of Harald Red-beard , father of Ása who was the mother of Halfdan the Black , the father of Harald Fairhair . ( The text actually reads \" Harald Grenski \" ( Haraldr inn grenski ) instead of Harald Red-beard , but that must be an error . Harald Grenski was the name of a later figure , the father of King Olaf II of Norway , and the Ynglinga saga and many other sources name Harald Red-beard as Ása \\'s father . Siklings Sigar is provided with two sons Siggeir and Sigmund ( Sigmundr ) . Siggeir is prominent in Volsunga saga as the villainous husband of Signý the daughter of Völsung . Sigmund son of Sigar married Hild , daughter of King Grjótgard ( Grjótgarðr ) of Mœr . ( See Gard Agdi for Grjótgard \\'s genealogy . ) Their son was Sigar , father of Signý , that Sigar who caused Hagbard ( Hagbarðr ) to be hanged . One of the sources where the story of Hagbard appears is in Gesta Danorum , Book 7 , which relates the love between Hagbarthus son of Hamundus and Signe daughter of King Sigarus despite Hagbarthus having slain her brothers . When Sigarus discovered the affair , he had Hagbarthus hanged . Then Hagbarthus \\' brother Haco/Hako/Haki avenged Hagbarthus . In this version Sigar/Sigarus is a king of Denmark , son of Sivaldus , son of King Ungvinus who was originally king of Götaland ( see Hagbard and Signy for more ) . There are places all over Scandinavia , associated with this legend such as Asige in the former Danish ( presently Swedish ) province of Halland , which borders Götaland , where there are two large menhirs called Hagbard \\'s gallows . Hagbard and his brother Haki are mentioned as great sea-kings in the Ynglinga saga where Haki wrests the Swedish throne from king Hugleik ( this event also appears in Gesta Danorum where Haco kills the Irish king Huglethus ) only to be killed later in battle with Hugleik \\'s cousin Jorund . A third reference to Hagbard and his brother Haki appears in the Völsunga saga , chapter 25 . It is there said that Hagbard and Haki not yet avenged themselves for Sigar \\'s abduction of one sister and the slaying of another . Either the reference is garbled or it refers to a lost variant with a more extended account of Sigar \\'s feud with Hagbard and his brothers . See Hagbard and Haki for more . Lofdungs Lofdi was a great king who raided Reidgotaland ( Reiðgotaland ) and became king there . Lofdi \\'s sons were Skekkil Sea-king ( Skekkill sækonungr ) and Skyli . Skyli was father of Egdir ( Egðir ) , the father of Hjálmthér ( Hjálmþér ) , the father of Eylimi , the father of Hjördís ( Hjǫrdís ) , the mother of Sigurd Fáfnir\\'s-bane , father of Áslaug ( Áslaugr ) by Brynhild whose ancestry appears below in the Budling discussion . This Áslaug was a wife of Ragnar Lodbrok and by him the mother of Sigurd Snake-in-the-Eye ( Sigurðr ormr í auga ) who was father of a second Áslaug who was mother of Sigurd Hart . Sigurd Hart was father of Ragnhild ( Ragnhildr ) , mother of Harald Fairhair as already stated . But stanza 26 of the Hyndluljód identifies Eylimi the father of Hjördís as an Ödling . Ödlings Audi and his brother Budli were sea-kings who raided together and settled in Valland ( Gaul ) and Saxland ( Saxony ) . Audi ruled in Valland . He was father of Fródi ( Fróði ) , father of Kjár ( Kjárr ) , father of Ölrún ( Ǫlrún ) . Ölrún , daughter of King Kjár of Valland , appears in the prose introduction to the Völundarkvida , as a Valkyrie swan-maiden who became the wife of Völund \\'s brother Egil . The name Kjárr can be etymologically derived from Latin Caesar . But here the connection with France suggests it might be an adaptation of French Charles . Budlungs Budli the sea-king settled down in Saxland . He was father of Attil ( Attill ) , father of Vífil ( Vífill ) , father of Læfi , father of Budli . This second Budli was father of Sörli ( Sǫrli ) or Serli , of Atli , and of Brynhild . Brynhild was mother of Áslaug , ancestress of Harald Fairhair as described in the previous Lofdungs discussion . Atli is a legendary version of Attila the Hun and the name Budli comes from Bleda who was the historical Attila \\'s elder brother . The name Sörli is given to a brother of Atli only in this text . But in the eddic poem Atlamál hin grœnlenzku ( stanza 50 ) , Atli declares that he was one of four living brothers when his father Budli died and that half of them are now dead , slain by his wife Gudrún . In the German Nibelungenlied Attila is called Etzel and said to be son of Botelung , obviously Budlung interpreted as a name . In this account Etzel has a younger brother named Bloedelin who was slain by Dancwart , Hagen \\'s brother . Blowdelin is probably another memory of the historical Bleda . The eddic poem Oddrúnargrátr tells of Atli \\'s sister Oddrún and her forbidden love affair with Gunnar , which was , according to this poem , one of the motivations for Atli \\'s later treachery . Oddrún is also mentioned in Sigurðarkviða hin skamma ( stanza 57 ) , in the prose introduction to Dráp Niflunga , and in the Völsunga saga . Niflungs King Næfil was father of Heimar , father of Eynef ( Eynefr ) , father of Rakni , father of Gjúki . GJúki was father of two sons named Gunnar ( Gunnarr ) and Högni ( Hǫgni ) and of two daughters named Gudrún ( Guðrún ) and Gudný ( Guðný ) . For commentary and variant traditions see Nibelung . Halfdan the Old of Gór \\'s lineage The Orkneying saga does not speak at all of Nór \\'s descendants , but introduces instead a figure named Halfdan the Old as the son of Sveidi ( Sveiði ) the Sea-king , who is called Svadi ( Svaði ) in the Ættartolur . Sveidi/Svadi in both texts was son of Heiti , son of Gór who was Nór \\'s brother . This second Halfdan the Old is father of Jarl Ívar of the Uplands who became father of Eystein the Clatterer ( Eysteinn Glumra ) , in turn father of Jarl Rögnvald of Møre . The Orkneyinga saga derives both the Jarls of Orkney and the Dukes of Normandy from Rögnvald .

It was first seen as a television film on May 12 , 1980 , and as a series on January 6 , 1981 , after a rebroadcast of the pilot on December 30 , 1980 . The show was based on a 1942 Robert Wilder novel of the same name and the 1949 movie scripted by Wilder and starring Joan Crawford . Flamingo Road was created to compete against CBS \\'s Dallas and Knots Landing , nighttime dramas that were inspired by the daily afternoon soap operas that had been a staple of TV for years . The character of Constance Weldon ranked at # 16 on E ! \\'s list of The 50 Most Wicked Women in Primetime . Synopsis The series took place in the fictional town of Truro , Florida , which was situated on the inside corner of the panhandle . Action revolved around the various characters of the show , most of whom had ties to the very wealthy Weldon family , who resided on ritzy Flamingo Road : Claude , who gained his fortune through the paper industry ; Eudora , his naive wife ; Constance , their believed to be adopted daughter , and Skipper , their son who was in his early 20s . Fielding Carlyle was Constance \\'s husband , while Lane Ballou was his frequent mistress . Lane worked for bar owner Lute-Mae Sanders , Constance \\'s biological mother ( Claude was her biological father , but no one knew it ) . At Lute-Mae \\'s , Lane became good friends with Sam Curtis , a construction magnate , whom she later married . Other important members in the cast were Titus Semple , the ruthless sheriff , and Elmo Tyson , editor of the Truro Clarion and Eudora \\'s high school sweetheart . Reception Though the show was initially popular , it soon succumbed to being scheduled against ABC \\'s romance/mystery Hart to Hart . NBC pulled the plug on the show in Spring 1982 , though reruns aired in the timeslot until mid summer of that year . Several of its stars later became better known for other works , including Morgan Fairchild , Mark Harmon , John Beck , and Woody Brown . Others were already relatively known when the series debuted , such as Howard Duff , Stella Stevens , Cristina Raines , and Barbara Rush . As the 1981–82 season ranked No . 68 out of 105 shows , NBC executives planned a daytime version of the primetime series to debut in September 1982 , but this never came to pass despite the fact a bible for a third season had been drafted by producer Jeff Freilich . Plot summary Pilot ( May 12 , 1980 , 2 hrs ) In the first part of the TV movie , we learn about how Lane Ballou , a singer with Coyne \\'s Traveling Circus , was left behind when the circus was run out of Truro , Florida . She is found by Deputy Fielding Carlyle , and they begin to bond over time . The sheriff , Titus Semple , is dismayed at this , because he wants Fielding to someday become a Senator , and he believes that he must marry the rich bitch socialite Constance Weldon . Lane stays in town and she and Field embark on a secret affair . Lane also takes a job at the Eagle Cafe , alongside Annabelle Troy , a middle-class young woman who is dating Constance \\'s brother Skipper . Constance starts planning her wedding , and begins to worry about Field \\'s whereabouts when he would be with Lane . Lute-Mae Sanders , a local bordello owner , starts worrying about Constance , who does not know that Lute-Mae is her biological mother . At the end of the hour , Lane is falsely picked up for solicitation . In the second hour , Lane comes back to town and gets a job at Lute-Mae \\'s , angering Titus , who thought he had finally gotten rid of her . Lute-Mae is confronted by the sheriff , but has the upper hand in the situation and Lane stays . Field and Constance are married in the Weldons \\' backyard , and much of the town is in attendance . Those who are not , though , are partying at Lute-Mae \\'s , where Lane is miserable over Field \\'s nuptials .

When they return , however , the drama continues . Field keeps his relationship up with Lane , including taking her with him on a business trip to Tallahassee .

Meanwhile , Mary Troy , Annabelle \\'s mother , comes to town upon learning of her daughter \\'s violent death . She , Skipper , and Lane , come to the conclusion that the Weldon fire was an arson , though they are never quite sure who set it up . It is discovered that Annabelle was Sheriff Titus Semple \\'s illegitimate daughter from years before after he forced himself on her mother Mary.Field goes back to drinking and is drunk on the day of an important campaign function , resulting in Constance blabbing unconfirmed information about his opponent . In the end , however , Field wins the election is made a Senator of Florida . After various fights and arguments , the Carlyles separate . Skipper , on the other hand , begins a relationship with new girl in town Christie Kovacs , who moved to Truro to live with her overbearing sister Alice who worked at the Weldon Paper Mill and who was secretly in love with Claude.Christie leaves Truro for good after being paid off for having a brief affair and then surviving a car accident with Field . Not long after Alice resigns and also leaves Truro after realizing Claude would never return her feelings . Skipper also prepares to leave town to accept a job in New Orleans , but decides to stay after Claude is seriously injured in an accident at the mill . Lane becomes frightened when she realizes that a murderer is after her , because she has inside information about a killing that went on several years earlier . Her friend from the circus , Beth McDonald , is killed , and within weeks , Lane is secretly kidnapped . While she is gone , Field and Constance finally divorce . Hurricane Michelle storms towards town and leaves most of the main cast stuck at Lute-Mae \\'s , with the exception of Elmo and Eudora who have dinner at the Clarion \\'s headquarters .

Soon , though , hell breaks loose and one of the men is shot , while they are all arrested . Field comforts Lane , but Constance breaks them up , claiming that the divorce papers she had drawn were fakes and that she and Field were still married . In a rage , Field sent Constance over the railing at the top of the stairs and onto the floor . Season two ( November 3 , 1981 – May 4 , 1982 , 22 episodes ) Constance survives her fall , but is paralyzed indefinitely from the waist down as a result . Claude is ready to press charges on ( and kill ) Field for pushing down his little girl , but Constance agrees to keep him quiet if Field continues their farce of a marriage . He agrees to her terms . While in the hospital , Lute-Mae and Claude have a candid talk about Constance , not knowing that Eudora is in the chapel with them . She soon learns that Lute-Mae and Claude are Constance \\'s biological parents . Lute-Mae faces her own problems , though , when she is raped by a delivery boy who works for the grocery store she shops at . Since the boy is part of an affluent Flamingo Road family , Titus refuses to press charges against him , but Lane and Lute-Mae soon get their justice . Field , acting as Senator , tries to fix a Cuban barrio in town , but then discovers that Claude Weldon owns it , though it is signed in Eudora \\'s name . Michael Tyronne makes his first appearance in town , bidding against Sam for a piece of waterfront property . Sam also becomes closer to Lane as the two slowly start to fall in love . After winning the bidding war with Sam , Michael also wants to buy the Cuban barrio , but Eudora does not want to sell , despite Claude \\'s efforts to make her think otherwise . Eudora becomes addicted to painkillers and is sent to live in a mental sanitarium eventually to recover and return to Flamingo Road . Constance regains the use of her legs , but realizes that while she was in her wheelchair , Field felt softer to her and that a reconciliation might happen . She pretends to still be paralyzed , but the truth comes out when Eudora has a fit for pills and Constance hops out of her chair to help her . Field happens to pass by the open door to Eudora \\'s room and sees Constance out of her chair , running frantically around Eudora . While Eudora is away , Claude forges her signature to sign over the barrio property to Tyronne . Tyronne has Titus evict the Cubans who live there , which includes two early 20 somethings who have ties to the Weldon family : Julio Sanchez , who starts a sexual relationship with Constance , and his sister Alicia , who falls in love with Skipper . Skipper and Alicia \\'s relationship seemed doomed . They were working late at the Clarion office one night when an explosion went off . They both survived , but Skipper lost his sight in the accident . Soon they eloped and moved into the Weldon mansion together . Michael Tyronne finally gets the barrio property and wants to build a casino resort on it . The problem is that gambling is illegal in Florida . He tries all he can to make Field rock the vote in the Senate to legalize gambling . Tyronne buys the bank that Claude has the Weldon Mill \\'s trust at and forecloses on it , making Field the new owner . As much as this pleases Field , he still goes against Tyronne \\'s plans . Tyronne loses the barrio , however , when Eudora gets wind of her name being forged . Fielding begins to stray away from Constance again , but not with Lane ( who had married Sam in a beautiful ceremony ) . He meets a reporter named Sandy Swanson and they fell in love . Unknown to Field , though , Sandy was Michael Tyronne \\'s sister . Tyronne had vengeance on his mind when he came to Truro . Over 20 years ago , Tyronne \\'s father had lived in Truro . He was convicted of a murder and Fielding \\'s father , Judge Andrew Carlyle , and Titus , who was still the sheriff back then , had him receive the death penalty . Tyronne firmly believed that his father was innocent , despite the endless evidence that pointed to his guilt . Still , Tyronne wanted everyone connected to Titus and Judge Carlyle to suffer . His method of destruction was voodoo . He kills Sandy by having her car go off a cliff , because she was sleeping with Field . After Tyronne beds most of the women on the show , and Constance beds most of the men , they find each other , but only for a while . Tyronne leaves her for a few rendezvous with Lute-Mae , after finding out that she is Constance \\'s mother . Lane is shocked that Lute-Mae would date a man like Tyronne , and it drives a wedge between the longtime friends . Lane also has good news . She and Sam are expecting a baby . Field finally cuts his ties with Tyronne when he decides to resign from the Senate , making him useless in Tyronne \\'s urge to make gambling legal in Florida . This angers Tyronne much more , and leads him to get his job done faster . He plots to drive Titus insane and reveals to Constance her true parentage . Soon after , though , someone gets the guts to kill him . After he dies , many people are suspected in the crime , everyone from Lute-Mae to Constance to Eudora to Claude .

The book presents opinions on what qualities men and women should have to be attractive and gives advice on sexual technique , warnings about sexual health , and recipes to remedy sexual maladies . It gives lists of names for the penis and vagina , has a section on the interpretation of dreams , and briefly describes sex among animals . Interspersed with these there are a number of stories which are intended to give context and amusement . History According to the introduction of Colville \\'s English translation , Muḥammad ibn Muḥammad al-Nafzawi probably wrote The Perfumed Garden sometime during the fifteenth century . Sheikh Nefzawi , full name Abu Abdullah Muhammad ben Umar Nafzawi , was born in the south of present-day Tunisia . He compiled at the request of the Hafsid ruler of Tunis , Abū Fāris ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz al-Mutawakkil , the present work . The reputation acquired by this work in the Arab world was similar to that of the Arabian Nights . Content of the book The Perfumed Garden is composed of an introduction followed by 21 chapters . Neither the first French translator nor Sir Richard Burton ( who translated the text from the French version ) give the 21st chapter . In these two translations , the book is about 100 pages long . Introduction The author praises God for having given us the pleasures of love-making . He says that God endowed women with beauty to inspire men to make love to them . He says that men have a natural weakness for the love of women . He says that he is a Muslim , that there is only one God and that Mohammed is his prophet . He says that he is the servant of God . He says that he wrote this book in Tunis for the Grand Vizir . He says that he had divided his work into different chapters to make it easier to read and understand . Chapter 1 : Men worthy of praise A man worthy of praise can easily get an erection , he is not quick to discharge and , once he has lost his sperm , his member is soon stiff again . His member is long enough to reach the end of his partner \\'s vagina and large enough to fill it . A man whose penis is too small can not please women . Nefzawi carries on with the fact that perfumes can excite women and that it is clever to use them . He tells the story of a man called Mocailma who used perfumes to possess a woman called Chedja , and it made wonders : she lost all her presence of mind and gave herself to him . It is at this point that three sexual positions are described for the first time : the man on top of the woman , who is lying on her back ; the woman on all fours ; the woman in prayer position , with her forehead on the ground and her buttocks in the air , elevated . After the story , the author adds that a man worthy of praise is anxious to please women . He takes care of his appearance ; he is truthful and sincere ; he is brave and generous ; he can be trusted ; he is a good conversationalist . However , he does not boast about his relationship with other women . To illustrate all this , the author tells the story of Bahloul , a buffoon who managed to make love to Hamdonna , the daughter of the King and the wife of the Grand Vizir . He first seduced her with his words . He then showed her his erected penis , which was strong and large . Upon doing this , she desired him and they made love . After they had climaxed , he kissed her lips and her breasts and then gave her cunnilingus . By that time , Bahloul was stiff again . They made love a second time ; and then , when they had both climaxed , a third time . Chapter 2 : Women worthy of praise A woman worthy of praise , according to Nefzawi has a perfect waist and is plump and lusty . She has black hair , large black eyes , an elegant nose , and vermilion lips . Her breath is of pleasant odour . Her breasts are full and firm . Her vulva does not emit a bad smell . Her hips are large . Her hands and her feet are of striking elegance . Furthermore , she speaks and laughs rarely . Nefzawi adds that she never leaves the house and that she is not treacherous . If her husband shows his intention to make love , she complies with it . She assists him in his affairs . She does not complain or cry much . When her husband is downhearted , she shares his troubles . In public , she hides her secret parts and does not let anyone see them . She always dresses well and avoids showing her husband what might be repugnant to him . At this point , the author tells the story of Dorerame , a slave who enjoyed making love with the most beautiful and well-born young women of his time , even if they belonged to other men . It is the longest story of the Perfumed Garden . We learn various things . For example , a woman says that a well-born lady could remain as long as six months without sex . We also learn that women can be very dangerous : he concludes this second chapter by saying that the moral of this tale is that \" a man who falls in love with a woman imperils himself , and exposes himself to the greatest troubles . \" Chapter 3 : Men who are to be held in contempt Men who are misshapen , whose member is short , who do not make love with vigour or in a manner that gives women enjoyment , who skip foreplay , who are quick to discharge their sperm and leave their partner right after the ejaculation , are men who are held in contempt by women . Men who lie , who can not be trusted , who conceal to their wives what they have been doing , except their adulterous affairs , are also men worthy of contempt .

Translations 1886 : Burton English translation The Perfumed Garden first became widely known in the English-speaking world through a translation from the French in 1886 by Sir Richard Francis Burton . Burton mentions that he considers that the work can be compared to those of Aretin and Rabelais , and the French book Conjugal Love by Nicolas Venette but what Burton believes makes The Perfumed Garden unique in the genre is \" the seriousness with which the most lascivious and obscene matters are presented . \" Burton points out that not all of the ideas in The Perfumed Garden are original : \" For instance , all the record of Moçama and of Chedja is taken from the work of Mohammed ben Djerir el Taberi ; the description of the different positions for coition , as well as the movements applicable to them , are borrowed from Indian works ; finally , the book Birds and Flowers by Azeddine el Mocadecci ( Izz al-Din al-Mosadeqi ) seems to have been consulted with respect to the interpretation of dreams . \" The French manuscript that Burton translated from was one printed by Isidore Liseux in 1886 . This manuscript \\'s last chapter — Chapter 21 — was incomplete , apparently because it contained material on homosexuality and pederasty which had been removed . When Burton died in late 1890 , he was working on a new translation of the original manuscript , including this missing chapter . The revised translation , due to be retitled The Scented Garden , was never published as Burton \\'s wife Isabel burned the manuscript soon after his death . 1976 : Khawam French translation A new French translation by René R . Khawam was published in 1976 . 1999 : Colville English translation In 1999 , Jim Colville published the first English Perfumed Garden translated directly from the Arabic original . Of the Burton translation , he says , \" details were expanded , episodes introduced and whole sections incorporated from other , non-Arabic , sources . The text is dressed up in a florid prose alien to the style of the original and many of the notes are sheer speculation . The result is a consistently exaggerated and bizarre misrepresentation of the original \" . Exaggeration on the part of Burton is vividly illustrated in Chapter 6 , titled \" Sexual Technique \" in Colville \\'s translation and \" Concerning Everything That Is Favourable to the Act of Coition \" in Burton \\'s . Burton \\'s translation is perhaps 25 pages long , lists 39 sex positions as well as 6 types of sexual movement , and gives creative names to many of these . Colville \\'s translation is 2½ pages long , and lists 12 unnamed sex positions . Inspiration for musical works In 1923 the English composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote Le jardin parfumé : Poem for Piano Solo . RAH Band released a single entitled “ Perfumed Garden ” in 1982 . Omnium Gatherum , a Finnish melodic death metal band , also wrote a song called \" The Perfumed Garden \" , released on their \" Spirits and August Light \" album in 2003 . Ray Manzarek , inspired by this , recorded a track called Perfumed Garden for his solo album The Whole Thing Started With Rock & Roll , Now It \\'s Out Of Control .

Among the operatives is a Hong Kong national identified as \" Jackie Chan \" . The CIA assigns Morgan Stollman to investigate the incident , unaware that he and newly retired General Sherman orchestrated the abduction for their personal profit . At the same time , the CIA assigns another operative in South Africa for a more covert operation . Jackie wakes up in a tribal village somewhere in the African veldt , still recovering from injuries sustained in an accident he can not remember ; as a result , when asked for his name by the natives , he responds by asking himself , \" Who Am I ? \" , and is referred to as that by the natives . The tribesmen show him the remains of a crashed helicopter and graves of those who perished aboard . He spends weeks recuperating from his wounds and learning about the tribe \\'s culture . After spotting rally cars from several miles away , \" Who Am I ? \" bids the village farewell and ventures on a journey back to civilization . He befriends Japanese rally co-driver Yuki after saving her brother from a snake bite and offering to help them finish the race . When they reach Johannesburg , \" Who Am I ? \" meets Christine Stark , a journalist sent to interview him about his rally adventure . However , Morgan hears of \" Who Am I ? \" and sends a hitman team to kill him . Morgan also pretends to be his ally , telling him to contact him if he is in danger . After escaping from the hitmen , Christine cracks a secret code written on a matchbook found on one of the dead operatives , which leads them to Rotterdam , in the Netherlands . \" Who Am I ? \" and Christine bid Yuki farewell and head for Rotterdam to find more answers to his identity .

It is revealed that Morgan and General Sherman are about to sell the extraterrestrial compound to a powerful arms dealer named Armano . While waiting for the online transaction to finish , the three men leave the conference room for a coffee break – giving \" Who Am I ? \" time to sneak in and steal the disc containing the compound information .

The film features several landmarks such as Sun City in South Africa , Erasmus Bridge in Rotterdam , the Beurstraverse ( which was portrayed by the film makers as being in Johannesburg ) , the Cube houses and the Willemswerf building ( which served as the headquarters of the villains and from the side of which , \" Who Am I ? \" escaped by sliding to the ground ) .

DVD release is cut by 9 minutes with the following changes and omissions : Unlike the original HK version of the film , the scene where Jackie Chan and his unit are double-crossed in the helicopter is shown immediately after the helicopters take off . This takes away the \" big reveal \" effect of what actually happened with Jackie and his men . \" Who Am I ? \" \\'s interaction with the African tribe has been reduced dramatically . Cuts include a scene in which he asks the tribal boy , Baba , how many days it takes to walk to civilization ; a scene where he and Baba run away from a lioness after he picks up a lion cub ; a scene showing the tribe \\'s farewell ceremony for \" Who Am I ? \" \\'s journey ; and a scene in which he performs an interpretation of the tribal dance . The rally race scene has been shortened . A scene where \" Who Am I ? \" recovers feeling in his mouth ( as he chewed herbal leaves into an anesthetic to cure Yuki \\'s brother \\'s snake bite ) and explains his situation to Yuki has been cut . All but two instant replay shots ( where Yuki , \" Who Am I ? \" and Christine drive through a fruit stand , and where \" Who Am I ? \" narrowly misses falling furniture in Rotterdam ) have been deleted . Unlike other domestic releases of Jackie Chan \\'s films , this version of Who Am I ? retains the film \\'s original musical score . Also , the U.S . release is the only cut which contains Jackie Chan \\'s original spoken English during his time with the African tribe . The uncut HK releases have dubbed it in Cantonese . Hong Kong The Hong Kong Universe Laser DVD ( now out of print ) contains the film as it was originally intended . The \" double-cross \" scene is not shown until during the interrogation scene as a \" revelation flashback . \" It is meant to be a mystery as to what happened until the viewer sees these flashbacks . It also contains \" Who Am I ? \" \\'s full interaction with the African tribe . However , his English dialogue during this interaction is dubbed into Cantonese during this part . There are English subtitles provided for the whole film . The presentation is not anamorphic , however . Japan Warner Bros . Japan has released two DVD editions of the film : the single-disc DVD contains the original Hong Kong cut of the film with an anamorphic presentation , but with no English subtitles , and it retains the Cantonese dub of Chan during the African tribe scenes .

Heinlein , published in 1985 . Like many of his later novels , it features Lazarus Long and Jubal Harshaw as supporting characters . Plot summary A writer seated at the best restaurant of the space habitat \" Golden Rule \" is approached by a man who urges him that \" Tolliver must die \" and is himself shot before the writer \\'s eyes . The writer—Colonel Colin Campbell , living under a number of aliases including his pen name \" Richard Ames \" —is joined by a beautiful and sophisticated lady , Gwendolyn Novak , who helps him flee to Luna with a bonsai maple and a would-be murderer ( \" Bill \" ) . After escaping to the Moon , Gwen claims to have been present during the revolt described in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . Still pursued by assassins , Campbell and Novak are rescued by an organization known as the Time Corps under the leadership of Lazarus Long . After giving Campbell a new foot to replace one lost in combat years before , the Time Corps attempts to recruit Campbell for a special mission . Accepting only on Gwen \\'s account , Campbell agrees to assist a team to retrieve the decommissioned Mike , a sentient computer introduced in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . Engaged in frequent time-travel , the Time Corps has been responsible for changing various events in the past , creating an alternate universe with every time-line they disrupt . Mike \\'s assistance is needed in order to accurately predict the conditions and following events in each of the new universes created . Campbell \\'s frequent would-be assassins are revealed to be members of contemporary agencies also engaged in time manipulation who , for unknown reasons , do not want to see Mike rescued by the Time Corps . During the mission , Gwen is grievously wounded and Campbell loses his foot again , though the Time Corps succeed in retrieving Mike . The story ends with Campbell talking into a recorder ( presumably the source of the first-person narrative ) reflecting on the mission and his relationship with Gwen . Background The Cat Who Walks Through Walls may be regarded as part of Heinlein \\'s multiverse series , or as a sequel to both The Number of the Beast and The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress . During a meeting of the Council of the Time Scouts , representatives from every major time line and setting written by Heinlein appear , including Glory Road and Starship Troopers , and references are made to other authors \\' works as well .

Heinlein Novels set in the 22nd century', 'Sedevacantism is a doctrinal position within traditionalist Catholicism which holds that the present occupier of the Holy See is not a valid pope due to the pope \\'s espousal of one or more heresies and that therefore , for lack of a valid pope , the See of Rome is vacant . The term sedevacantism is derived from the Latin phrase sede vacante , which means \" with the chair [ i.e . of the Bishop of Rome ] being vacant \" . The phrase is commonly used to refer specifically to a vacancy of the Holy See from the death , the resignation , the falling into insanity , or the public heresy of a pope to the election of his successor . Among those who maintain that the see of Rome , occupied by what they declare to be an illegitimate pope , was really vacant , some have chosen an alternative pope of their own , and thus in their view ended the vacancy of the see , and are known sometimes as conclavists . The number of sedevacantists is unknown and difficult to measure ; estimates range from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands . Positions Origin Sedevacantism owes its origins to the rejection of the theological and disciplinary changes implemented following the Second Vatican Council ( 1962–65 ) . Sedevacantists reject this Council , on the basis of their interpretation of its documents on ecumenism and religious liberty , among others , which they see as contradicting the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church and as denying the unique mission of Catholicism as the one true religion , outside of which there is no salvation . They also say that new disciplinary norms , such as the Mass of Paul VI , promulgated on 3 April 1969 , undermine or conflict with the historical Catholic faith and are deemed blasphemous , while post-Vatican II teachings , particularly those related to ecumenism , are labelled heresies . They conclude , on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and of postconciliar Church teaching as false , that the popes involved are also false . Among even traditionalist Catholics , this is a quite divisive question . Traditionalist Catholics other than sedevacantists recognize as legitimate the line of popes leading to and including Pope Francis . Sedevacantists , however , claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council , and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church . Accordingly , they hold that Pope John XXIII and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church . A formal heretic , they say , can not be the Catholic pope . Justification While Sedevacantists \\' arguments often hinge on their interpretation of modernism as being a heresy , this is also debated . Positions within sedevacantism On clergy , Mass , and sacraments Some sedevacantists accept the consecrations and ordinations of sedevacantist bishops and priests , and the offering of Masses and the administration of sacraments by the said bishops and priests , to be licit because of epikea , i.e . \" the interpretation of the mind and will of him who made the law \" . In this case , the ecclesiastical laws ( e.g . prohibition of consecrations of bishops without papal mandate ; prohibition of administration of sacraments without ecclesiastical authorization ) are interpreted to cease when to follow them would be impossible , harmful , or unreasonable , or would mean transgressing divine laws ( e.g . the Church must have bishops and priests ; Catholics must attend Mass and receive the sacraments ) , and because of a historical precedent for consecrating Catholic bishops during a long vacancy of the Holy See . On liturgy Another divisive question among sedevacantists is whether it is permissible to go to \" una cum \" masses ( Traditional Latin Masses where the name of the person considered by mainstream Catholics as Pope \\' is said in the Roman Canon , specifically in the \" Te igitur \" prayer , where the priest says \" una cum famulo tuo Papa nostro N . \" [ \" together with Thy Servant N. , our Pope \" ] ) . Such \" una cum \" masses are offered by the priests of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter . Some argue that it is , or may be , permissible , while others argue that is it not permissible , and that such masses are illicit and forbidden to Catholics . Relationship to Sedeprivationism A sizeable portion of sedevacantists affirm the Thesis of Cassiciacum of the Dominican theologian Bishop Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers as being a valid position , which states that John XXIII and his successors are popes materialiter sed non formaliter , that is , \" materially but not formally , \" and that the post-Vatican II popes will become pope if they recant their heresies . Demography There are estimated to be between several tens of thousands and more than two hundred thousand sedevacantists worldwide , mostly concentrated in the United States , Canada , France , the United Kingdom , Italy , and Australia , but the actual size of the sedevacantist movement has never been accurately assessed . It remains extremely difficult to establish the size of the movement for a wide range of reasons , such as the fact that not all sedevacantists identify themselves as such , nor do they necessarily adhere to sedevacantist groups or societies . Early proponents Early proponents of sedevacantism include : Patrick Henry Omlor , an American author who , in 1965 , expressed the view that Paul VI was not the pope . Francis Schuckardt , an American who gained considerable fame as a charismatic speaker for the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima , who served as its international secretary , and who although still working within the mainstream Catholic Church in 1967 , publicly took the position in 1968 that the Holy See was vacant and that the Church that had emerged from the Second Vatican Council was no longer the Catholic Church . He founded the Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen ( CMRI ) . Bishop Daniel Q . Brown , an American former Old Catholic bishop who converted to sedevacantism and an associate of Schuckardt . Yukio Nemoto , a Japanese who created the sedevacantist group Seibo No Mikuni ( Kingdom of Our Lady , 聖母の御国 ) . Father Joaquín Sáenz y Arriaga , a Mexican Jesuit priest and theologian who put forward sedevacantist ideas in his books The New Montinian Church ( August 1971 ) and Sede Vacante ( 1973 ) . His writings gave rise to the sedevacantist movement in Mexico , led by Father Sáenz , Father Moisés Carmona , and Father Adolfo Zamora. , priests who formed the Unión Católica Trento ( Tridentine Catholic Union ) . Father Francis E . Fenton , an American priest who was inspired by Sáenz \\'s writings and founded the Orthodox Roman Catholic Movement as an American parallel to the Mexican Unión Católica Trento . Father ( later Bishop ) Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers , a French Dominican priest and theologian who developed the Thesis of Cassiciacum in the 1970s . Several American priests of the Society of Saint Pius X ( SSPX ) : Father Daniel Dolan , Father Anthony Cekada , and Father Donald Sanborn , reportedly sedevacantists in the 1970s , who were expelled , along with several other priests , by Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre for holding this view . Nine of these priests later founded the Society of Saint Pius V ( SSPV ) in 1983 . Father Gommar DePauw , an American priest and canonist who founded the organization he named Catholic Traditionalist Movement . Father Oswald Baker , an English priest who was a sedevacantist by at least 1982 , and reportedly some time prior to that . Father Lucian Pulvermacher , an American missionary priest who left the Roman Catholic Church in 1976 and in 1998 was elected pope of the conclavist \" True Catholic Church \" with the name of \" Pius XIII \" . Bishops and holy orders Catholic theology holds that any bishop can validly ordain any baptized male to the priesthood , and any priest to the episcopacy , provided that , with the intention to do what the Church does , he uses a rite of ordination or consecration considered valid by the Catholic Church . Sedevacantist bishops Consecrated pre-Vatican II who became sedevacantists The only known Catholic bishop consecrated before the Second Vatican Council who publicly became sedevacantist was Vietnamese Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục ( consecrated in 1938 ) , former Vicar Apostolic of Vĩnh Long , Vietnam and former Archbishop of Huế , Vietnam . Bishop Alfredo Méndez-Gonzalez ( consecrated in 1960 ) , former Bishop of Arecibo , Puerto Rico , though not a sedevacantist , at least not a public one , associated himself with sedevacantist priests and consecrated a bishop for them . Thục line bishops The \" Thục line \" bishops designates bishops who derive their episcopacy from Archbishop Thục or from bishops of Thục \\'s lineage . Many bishops in the \" Thục line \" are part of the non-sedevacantist Palmarian Catholic Church ; this is due to Thục having consecrated Bishop Clemente Domínguez y Gómez , future head of the Palmarian Church , and the very numerous episcopal consecrations within this organization . On 7 May 1981 , Thục consecrated the sedeprivationist French priest Michel-Louis Guérard des Lauriers as a bishop . Des Lauriers was a French Dominican theologian and a papal advisor . On 17 October 1981 , Thục consecrated the sedevacantist Mexican priests Moisés Carmona and Adolfo Zamora as bishops . Carmona and Zamora had been sedevacantist leaders and propagators in Mexico for many years , and were among the priests who formed the Tridentine Catholic Union . The Vatican declared Thục ipso facto excommunicated for these consecrations and for his declaration of sedevacantism . There are many sedevacantist bishops today whose episcopal lineages descend from Archbishop Thuc , either or both through Bishop Guerard des Lauriers and Bishop Moises Carmona . Méndez-line bishops On 19 October 1993 , in Carlsbad , California , United States , Bishop Méndez-Gonzalez consecrated the sedevacantist Father Clarence Kelly of the Society of Saint Pius V ( SSPV ) to the episcopacy . By Méndez \\' wish , the consecration was kept secret until his death in 1995 . There are two sedevacantist bishops who descend from Bishop Méndez through Bishop Kelly . Both are bishops of the Congregation of Saint Pius V . Whose lineages derive from earlier movements A considerable number of sedevacantist bishops are thought to derive their holy orders from Bishop Carlos Duarte Costa , who in 1945 set up his own independent Brazilian Catholic Apostolic Church . Carlos Duarte Costa was not a sedevacantist , and instead questioned the papacy as an institution : he denied Papal Infallibility and rejected the pope \\'s universal jurisdiction . In further contrast to most Catholic traditionalism , Duarte Costa was left-wing . Groups Sedevacantist groups include : Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen ( CMRI ) , formed in 1967 . It operates in North America , South America , Europe , and Asia ; is based in Omaha , Nebraska , United States ; and is headed by Bishop Mark Pivarunas . Society of Saint Pius V ( SSPV ) , formed in 1983 when nine American priests of the Society of Saint Pius X split from the organization over a number of issues including using the liturgical reforms implemented under Pope John XXIII . It operates in North America , is based in Oyster Bay Cove , New York , United States , and is headed by Bishop Clarence Kelly . Istituto Mater Boni Consilii ( Institute of the Mother of Good Counsel ; IMBC ) , formed in 1985 when four Italian priests of the Society of Saint Pius X split from the organization . It holds to the position of sedeprivationism . It operates in Europe and Argentina , and is based in Verrua Savoia , Turin , Italy . Its bishop is Bishop Geert Stuyver . Sociedad Sacerdotal Trento ( Priestly Society of Trent ; SST ) , formed in 1993 by the priests of the deceased Bishop Moisés Carmona . It operates in North America , South America , and Europe , and is based in Acapulco , Guerrero , Mexico . Its bishop is Bishop Martín Dávila Gandara . Roman Catholic Institute ( RCI ) , founded in 1993 by Bishop Donald Sanborn . It consists of Sanborn , his priests , and some of his seminarians , and is based in Brooksville , Florida , United States .

( concerning strict sedevacantists as well as conclavists ) 20th-century Christianity 21st-century Christianity Christian terminology Independent Catholicism', 'Kamadhenu ( , , ) , also known as Surabhi ( , ) , is a divine bovine-goddess described in Hinduism as the mother of all cows . She is a miraculous cow of plenty who provides her owner whatever he desires and is often portrayed as the mother of other cattle . In iconography , she is generally depicted as a white cow with a female head and breasts , the wings of a bird , and the tail of a peafowl or as a white cow containing various deities within her body . Kamadhenu is not worshipped independently as a goddess . Rather , she is honored by the Hindu veneration of cows , who are regarded her earthly embodiments . Hindu scriptures provide diverse accounts of the birth of Kamadhenu . While some narrate that she emerged from the churning of the cosmic ocean , others describe her as the daughter of the creator god Daksha , and as the wife of the sage Kashyapa . Still other scriptures narrate that Kamadhenu was in the possession of either Jamadagni or Vashista ( both ancient sages ) , and that kings who tried to steal her from the sage ultimately faced dire consequences for their actions . Kamadhenu plays the important role of providing milk and milk products to be used in her sage-master \\'s oblations ; she is also capable of producing fierce warriors to protect him . In addition to dwelling in the sage \\'s hermitage , she is also described as dwelling in Goloka - the realm of the cows - and Patala , the netherworld . Etymology Kamadhenu is often addressed by the proper name Surabhi or Shurbhi , which is also used as a synonym for an ordinary cow . Professor Jacobi considers the name Surabhi— \" the fragrant one \" —to have originated from the peculiar smell of cows . According to the Monier Williams Sanskrit–English Dictionary ( 1899 ) , Surabhi means fragrant , charming , pleasing , as well as cow and earth . It can specifically refer to the divine cow Kamadhenu , the mother of cattle who is also sometimes described as a Matrika ( \" mother \" ) goddess . Other proper names attributed to Kamadhenu are Sabala ( \" the spotted one \" ) and Kapila ( \" the red one \" ) . The epithets \" Kamadhenu \" ( कामधेनु ) , \" Kamaduh \" ( कामदुह् ) and \" Kamaduha \" ( कामदुहा ) literally mean the cow \" from whom all that is desired is drawn \" — \" the cow of plenty \" . In the Mahabharata and Devi Bhagavata Purana , in the context of the birth of Bhishma , the cow Nandini is given the epithet Kamadhenu . In other instances , Nandini is described as the cow-daughter of Surabhi-Kamadhenu . The scholar Vettam Mani considers Nandini and Surabhi to be synonyms of Kamadhenu . Iconography and symbolism According to Indologist Madeleine Biardeau , Kamadhenu or Kamaduh is the generic name of the sacred cow , who is regarded as the source of all prosperity in Hinduism . Kamadhenu is regarded as a form of Devi ( the Hindu Divine Mother ) and is closely related to the fertile Mother Earth ( Prithvi ) , who is often described as a cow in Sanskrit . The sacred cow denotes \" purity and non-erotic fertility , ... sacrificing and motherly nature , [ and ] sustenance of human life \" . Frederick M . Smith describes Kamadhenu as a \" popular and enduring image in Indian art \" . All the gods are believed to reside in the body of Kamadhenu—the generic cow . Her four legs are the scriptural Vedas ; her horns are the triune gods Brahma ( tip ) , Vishnu ( middle ) and Shiva ( base ) ; her eyes are the sun and moon gods , her shoulders the fire-god Agni and the wind-god Vayu and her legs the Himalayas . Kamadhenu is often depicted in this form in poster art . Another representation of Kamadhenu shows her with the body of a white Zebu cow , crowned woman \\'s head , colourful eagle wings and a peacock \\'s tail . According to the Philadelphia Museum of Art , this form is influenced by the iconography of the Islamic Buraq , who is portrayed with a horse \\'s body , wings , and a woman \\'s face . Contemporary poster art also portrays Kamadhenu in this form . A cow , identified with Kamadhenu , is often depicted accompanying the god Dattatreya . In relation to the deity \\'s iconography , she denotes the Brahminical aspect and Vaishnava connection of the deity contrasting with the accompanying dogs—symbolizing a non-Brahminical aspect . She also symbolizes the Panch Bhuta ( the five classical elements ) in the icon . Dattatreya is sometimes depicted holding the divine cow in one of his hands . Birth and children The Mahabharata ( Adi Parva book ) records that Kamadhenu-Surabhi rose from the churning of the cosmic ocean ( Samudra manthan ) by the gods and demons to acquire Amrita ( ambrosia , elixir of life ) . As such , she is regarded the offspring of the gods and demons , created when they churned the cosmic milk ocean and then given to the Saptarishi , the seven great seers . She was ordered by the creator-god Brahma to give milk , and supply it and ghee ( \" clarified butter \" ) for ritual fire-sacrifices . The Anushasana Parva book of the epic narrates that Surabhi was born from the belch of \" the creator \" ( Prajapati ) Daksha after he drank the Amrita that rose from the Samudra manthan . Further , Surabhi gave birth to many golden cows called Kapila cows , who were called the mothers of the world . The Satapatha Brahmana also tells a similar tale : Prajapati created Surabhi from his breath . The Udyoga Parva Book of the Mahabharata narrates that the creator-god Brahma drank so much Amrita that he vomited some of it , from which emerged Surabhi . According to the Ramayana , Surabhi is the daughter of sage Kashyapa and his wife Krodhavasha , the daughter of Daksha . Her daughters Rohini and Gandharvi are the mothers of cattle and horses respectively . Still , it is Surabhi who is described as the mother of all cows in the text . However , in the Puranas , such as Vishnu Purana and Bhagavata Purana , Surabhi is described as the daughter of Daksha and the wife of Kashyapa , as well as the mother of cows and buffaloes . The Matsya Purana notes two conflicting descriptions of Surabhi . In one chapter , it describes Surabhi as the consort of Brahma and their union produced the cow Yogishvari , She is then described as the mother of cows and quadrupeds . In another instance , she is described as a daughter of Daksha , wife of Kashyapa and the mother of cows . The Harivamsa , an appendix of the Mahabharata , calls Surabhi the mother of Amrita ( ambrosia ) , Brahmins , cows and Rudras . The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates that Krishna and his lover Radha were enjoying dalliance , when they thirsted for milk . So , Krishna created a cow called Surabhi and a calf called Manoratha from the left side of his body , and milked the cow . When drinking the milk , the milk pot fell on the ground and broke , spilling the milk , which became the Kshirasagara , the cosmic milk ocean . Numerous cows then emerged from the pores of Surabhi \\'s skin and were presented to the cowherd-companions ( Gopas ) of Krishna by him . Then Krishna worshipped Surabhi and decreed that she—a cow , the giver of milk and prosperity—be worshipped at Diwali on Bali Pratipada day . Various other scriptural references describe Surabhi as the mother of the Rudras including Nirrti ( Kashyapa being the father ) , the cow Nandini and even the serpent-people nāgas . The Mahabharata also makes a passing reference to Surabhi as the mother of Nandini ( literally \" daughter \" ) in the context of the birth of Bhishma , an incarnation of a Vasu deity . Nandini , like her mother , is a \" cow of plenty \" or Kamadhenu , and resides with sage Vashista . Nandini is stolen by the divine Vasus and thus cursed by the sage to be born on the earth . The Raghuvamsa of Kalidasa mentions that king Dilip—an ancestor of god Rama—once passed by Kamadhenu-Surabhi , but failed to pay respects to her , thus incurring the wrath of the divine cow , who cursed the king to go childless . So , since Kamadhenu had gone to Patala , the guru of Dilip , Vasistha advised the king to serve Nandini , Kamadhenu \\'s daughter who was in the hermitage . The king and his wife propitiated Nandini , who neutralized her mother \\'s curse and blessed the king to have a son , who was named Raghu . In the Ramayana , Surabhi is described to be distressed by the treatment of her sons—the oxen—in fields . Her tears are considered a bad omen for the gods by Indra , the god-king of heaven . The Vana Parva book of the Mahbharata also narrates a similar instance : Surabhi cries about the plight of her son—a bullock , who is overworked and beaten by his peasant-master . Indra , moved by Surabhi \\'s tears , rains to stop the ploughing of the tormented bullock . Wealth and protector of the Brahmin In Hindu Religion , Kamadhenu is often associated with the Brahmin ( \" priest class \" including sages ) , whose wealth she symbolizes . Cow \\'s milk and its derivatives such as ghee ( clarified butter ) are integral parts of Vedic fire sacrifices , which are conducted by Brahmin priests ; thus the ancient Kamadhenu is sometimes also referred to the Homadhenu—the cow from whom oblations are drawn . Moreover , the cow also offers the Brahmin—who is prohibited to fight—protection against abusive kings who try to harm them . As a goddess , she becomes a warrior , creating armies to protect her master and herself . Jamadagni \\'s cow A legend narrates that the sacred cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni . The earliest version of the legend , which appears in the epic Mahabharata , narrates that the thousand-armed Haihaya king , Kartavirya Arjuna , destroyed Jamadagni \\'s hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu . To retrieve the calf , Jamadagni \\'s son Parashurama slew the king , whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni . Parashurama then destroyed the kshatriya ( \" warrior \" ) race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace . Similar accounts of the abduction of the celestial cow or her calf , the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna , and the revenge of Parashurama resulting in the death of Kartavirya Arjuna , exist in other texts . The Bhagavata Purana mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king and returned the kine to his father . The Padma Purana mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her , Kamadhenu , by her own power , defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven ; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni . In the Brahmanda Purana , Kamadhenu creates a great city by her power to accommodate Kartavirya Arjuna \\'s army , when they visit Jamadagni \\'s hermitage . On returning to his kingdom , Kartavirya Arjuna \\'s minister , Chandragupta , persuades him to capture the divine cow . The minister returns to the hermitage and tries to convince the sage to give away the cow , but to no avail , so he tries to snatch Kamadhenu with force . In the ensuing fight , the sage is killed , but Kamadhenu escapes to the sky and Chandragupta takes her calf with him instead . The Brahmanda Purana narrates this Kamadhenu Sushila was given to Jamadagni by the Kamadhenu-Surabhi , who governs in Goloka . The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates that the celestial cow – called Kapila here – produces various weapons and an army to aid Jamadagni defeat the king \\'s army , who had come to seize her . When the king himself challenged Jamadagni for battle , Kapila instructed her master in martial arts . Jamadagni led the army created by Kapila and defeated the king and his army several times ; each time sparing the life of the king . Finally , with the aid of a divine spear granted to him by the god Dattatreya , the king killed Jamadagni . Vashista \\'s cow The Ramayana presents a similar account about Kamadhenu , however , here the sage is Vashista and the king is Vishwamitra . Once , king Vishwamitra with his army arrived at the hermitage of sage Vashista . The sage welcomed him and offered a huge banquet – to the army – that was produced by Sabala – as Kamadhenu is called in the text . The astonished king asked the sage to part with Sabala and instead offered thousand of ordinary cows , elephants , horses and jewels in return . However , the sage refused to part with Sabala , who was necessary for the performance of the sacred rituals and charity by the sage . Agitated , Vishwamitra seized Sabala by force , but she returned to her master , fighting the king \\'s men . She hinted Vashista to order her to destroy the king \\'s army and the sage followed her wish . Intensely , she produced Pahlava warriors , who were slain by Vishwamitra \\'s army . So she produced warriors of Shaka-Yavana lineage . From her mouth , emerged the Kambhojas , from her udder Barvaras , from her hind Yavanas and Shakas , and from pores on her skin , Haritas , Kiratas and other foreign warriors . Together , the army of Sabala killed Vishwamitra \\'s army and all his sons . This event led to a great rivalry between Vashista and Vishwamitra , who renounced his kingdom and became a great sage to defeat Vashista . Abodes Kamadhenu-Surabhi \\'s residence varies depending on different scriptures . The Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata tells how she was given the ownership of Goloka , the cow-heaven located above the three worlds ( heaven , earth and netherworld ) : the daughter of Daksha , Surabhi went to Mount Kailash and worshipped Brahma for 10,000 years . The pleased god conferred goddess-hood on the cow and decreed that all people would worship her and her children – cows . He also gave her a world called Goloka , while her daughters would reside on earth among humans . In one instance in the Ramayana , Surabhi is described to live in the city of Varuna – the Lord of oceans – which is situated below the earth in Patala ( the netherworld ) . Her flowing sweet milk is said to form Kshiroda or the Kshirasagara , the cosmic milk ocean . In the Udyoga Parva book of the Mahabharata , this milk is said to be of six flavours and has the essence of all the best things of the earth . The Udyoga Parva specifies that Surabhi inhabits the lowest realm of Patala , known as Rasatala , and has four daughters – the Dikpalis – the guardian cow goddesses of the heavenly quarters : Saurabhi in the east , Harhsika in the south , Subhadra in the west and Dhenu in the north . Apart from Goloka and Patala , Kamadhenu is also described as residing in the hermitages of the sages Jamadagni and Vashista . Scholar Mani explains the contradicting stories of Kamadhenu \\'s birth and presence in the processions of many gods and sages by stating that while there could be more than one Kamadhenu , all of them are incarnations of the original Kamadhenu , the mother of cows . Other scriptural references The Bhagavad Gita , a discourse by the god Krishna in the Mahabharata , twice refers to Kamadhenu as Kamadhuk . In verse 3.10 , Krishna makes a reference to Kamadhuk while conveying that for doing one \\'s duty , one would get the milk of one \\'s desires . In verse 10.28 , when Krishna declares to the source of the universe , he proclaims that among cows , he is Kamadhuk . In the Anushasana Parva of the Mahabharata , the god Shiva is described as having cast a curse on Surabhi . This curse is interpreted as a reference to the following legend : Once , when the gods Brahma and Vishnu were fighting over who was superior , a fiery pillar—linga ( symbol of Shiva ) —emerged before them . It was that decided whoever found the end of this pillar was superior . Brahma flew to the skies to try to find the top of the pillar , but failed . So Brahma forced Surabhi ( in some versions , Surabhi instead suggested that Brahma should lie ) to falsely testify to Vishnu that Brahma had seen the top of the linga ; Shiva punished Surabhi by putting a curse on her so that her bovine offspring would have to eat unholy substances . This tale appears in the Skanda Purana . Worship Some temples and houses have images of Kamadhenu , which are worshipped . However , she has never had a worship cult dedicated to her and does not have any temples where she is worshipped as the chief deity . In Monier-Williams \\'s words : \" It is rather the living animal [ the cow ] which is the perpetual object of adoration \" . Cows are often fed outside temples and worshipped regularly on all Fridays and on special occasions . Every cow to \" a pious Hindu \" is regarded as an avatar ( earthly embodiment ) of the divine Kamadhenu .

It has been awarded since 1956 , although between 2010 and 2015 , an agreement was made with FIFA , and the award was temporarily merged with the FIFA World Player of the Year ( founded in 1991 ) and known as the FIFA Ballon d'Or . However , the partnership ended in 2016 , and the award reverted to the Ballon d'Or , while FIFA also reverted to its own separate annual award The Best FIFA Men 's Player . The recipients of the joint FIFA Ballon d'Or are considered as winners by both award organisations . Conceived by sports writer Gabriel Hanot , the Ballon d'Or award honours the male player deemed to have performed the best over the previous year , based on voting by football journalists , from 1956 to 2006 . After 2007 , coaches and captains of national teams were also given the right to vote . Originally , it was awarded only to players from Europe and widely known as the European Footballer of the Year award . In 1995 , the Ballon d'Or was expanded to include all players from any origin that have been active at European clubs . The award became a global prize in 2007 with all professional footballers from around the world being eligible . History Stanley Matthews of England was the inaugural winner of the Ballon d'Or . Prior to 2007 , the award was generally known as the continental European Footballer of the Year award in English language and much international media . Even after 2007 , it was usually identified with and referred to by that name because of its origin as a European award , until it was merged with FIFA 's World Player award cementing its new worldwide claim . Liberia 's George Weah , the only African recipient , became the first non-European to win the award in 1995 , the year that rules of eligibility were changed for the first time . Ronaldo of Brazil became the first South American winner two years later . The second rule change in 2007 to include players from all continents did not bring up new winners , as all recipients since then have still exclusively been active in Europe during their win . Lionel Messi has won the award a record seven times , followed by Cristiano Ronaldo with five . Three players have won the award three times each : Johan Cruyff , Michel Platini , and Marco van Basten . With seven awards each , Dutch , German , Argentine and Portuguese players have won the most Ballons d'Or . Players from Germany ( 1972 , 1981 ) and the Netherlands ( 1988 ) were the only to take all three top spots in one year , with German ( 1972 ) and especially Italian clubs ( 1988–1990 ) achieving the same feat , including two years solely made up of AC Milan players ( 1988 , 1989 ) , a unique record until Spanish clubs experienced an unforeseen dominance ( 2009–2012 , 2015 , 2016 ) and Barcelona ( 2010 ) became the second club with three top players . Two Spanish clubs , Barcelona and Real Madrid , also lead the ranking for employing the most winners , with twelve and eleven wins . Between 2010 and 2015 inclusive , the award was merged with a similar one , the FIFA World Player of the Year award , to create the FIFA Ballon d'Or , which was awarded to the world 's best male player before FIFA and France Football decided not to continue the merging agreement . After 2011 , UEFA created the UEFA Best Player in Europe Award to maintain the tradition of the original Ballon d'Or of specifically honouring a football player from Europe . Eight players ( Bobby Charlton , Franz Beckenbauer , Gerd Müller , Paolo Rossi , Zinedine Zidane , Rivaldo , Ronaldinho , and Kaká ) have won the FIFA World Cup , the European Cup/UEFA Champions League , and the Ballon d'Or during their careers . The award shows a bias in favor of attacking players , which has increased in recent decades . Over time , the award has gone to a more exclusive set of leagues and clubs . Prior to 1995 , 10 leagues supplied Ballon d'Or winners , whereas only England , France , Germany , Italy , and Spain have supplied winners since 1995 . Spain 's La Liga has the most Ballon d'Or winners . Barcelona and Real Madrid have supplied the most Ballon d'Or winners since 1995 . In 2020 , the Group L'Équipe , to which France Football belongs , decided that no award would be given for the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic cutting short the seasons of football clubs worldwide . Winners Wins by player Wins by country Wins by club Additional awards An honorary award , under the name Super Ballon d'Or , was awarded to Alfredo Di Stéfano in 1989 , after he surpassed Johan Cruyff and Michel Platini in France Footballs voting . A decade later , France Football elected Pelé the Football Player of the Century after consulting their former Ballon d'Or recipients . Among the 34 previous winners , 30 cast their votes , while Stanley Matthews , Omar Sívori and George Best abstained , and Lev Yashin had died . Each voter was allotted five votes worth up to five points ; however , Di Stéfano only chose a first place , Platini a first and second place , and George Weah two players for fifth place . Pelé was named the greatest by 17 voters , receiving almost double the number of points earned by the runner-up , Diego Maradona . To coincide with the 60th anniversary of the Ballon d'Or in 2016 , France Football published a reevaluation of the awards presented before 1995 , when only European players were eligible to win the award . 12 out of the 39 Ballons d'Or presented during this time period would have been awarded to South American players ; in addition to Pelé and Diego Maradona , Garrincha , Mario Kempes , and Romário were retrospectively recognized as worthy winners . The original recipients , however , remain unchanged . Maradona and Pelé also received honorary Ballons d'Ors for their services to football in 1995 and 2013 , respectively .

They date from between 1598 and 1602 . They were performed in London by students for an audience of students as part of the Christmas festivities of St John \\'s College at Cambridge University . It is not known who wrote them . The titles of the three plays are The Pilgrimage to Parnassus The Return from Parnassus The Return from Parnassus : Or the Scourge of Simony The second and third plays are sometimes referred to as Part One and Part Two of The Return from Parnassus . For the most part , the plays follow the experiences of two students , Philomusus and Studioso . The first play tells the story of two pilgrims on a journey to Parnassus . The plot is an allegory understood to represent the story of two students progressing through the traditional course of education known as the trivium . The accomplishment of their education is represented by Mount Parnassus . The second play drops the allegory and describes the two graduates \\' unsuccessful attempts to make a living , as does the third play , which is the only one that was contemporaneously published . New in the third play is the serious treatment of issues regarding censorship . It has been said that this trilogy of plays \" in originality and breadth of execution , and in complex relationship to the academic , literary , theatrical and social life of the period , ranks supreme among the extant memorials of the university stage \" , and that they are \" among the most inexplicably neglected key documents of Shakespeare \\'s age \" . Overview of the three plays The first play , The Pilgrimage to Parnassus , describes allegorically the progress of the two students through the university courses of logic , rhetoric , etc. , and the temptations that are set before them by their meeting with Madido , a drunkard , Stupido , a puritan who hates learning , Amoretto , a lover , and Ingenioso , a disappointed student . The first play was certainly intended to stand alone , but the favour with which it was received led to the writing of a sequel , The Return from Parnassus , which deals with the struggles of the two students after the completion of their studies at the university , and shows them discovering by bitter experience of how little pecuniary value their learning is . A further sequel , The Return from Parnassus , Or the Scourge of Simony , is more ambitious than the two earlier plays . Knowledge of what occurs in the first two plays is not essential to understand the third play , but it is helpful to illuminate a few of the allusions that occur . The trilogy of the Parnassus plays can be seen as a sustained questioning of the worth of a humanist education , and as a consideration of the employment crisis that faced graduates at the end of the Elizabethan period . The plays are lively and amusing , and contain a sense of taking stock of the writer \\'s place in society at the turn of the century . They are neglected by academic scholarship , and not greatly appreciated as plays in their own right , but they are known as a source for references to Shakespeare and Jonson , and for other allusions they contain . Synopsis of The Pilgrimage to Parnassus Cast Studioso Philomusus Consiliodorus Madido Stupido Amoretto Ingenioso Clowne Dromo An old farmer , Consiliodorus , gives advice to his son , Philomusus , and his nephew , Studioso , as the two young men are about to begin their journey to Parnassus . He advises them not to consort with wastrels and to eschew alcohol and sex , which will distract them . The first place the two young men travel through is the mountainous land of Logique on their way to the island of Dialectica , where they meet a poet , Madido . Madido does n\\'t believe in Parnassus and thinks inspiration is only to be found in drink . Madido urges them not to bother with their journey , but to stay and drink with him . They decline and continue on . Next , in the land of Rhetorique , Philomusus and Studioso overtake a character named Stupido , who set out on the same pilgrimage ten years ago , but has given up and now follows trivial pursuits . He disguises his lack of talent with a pose of not appreciating scholarship . Philomusus and Studioso then encounter the lover , Amaretto , who encourages them to leave their pilgrimage , and instead linger in the land of Poetry and dally with wenches . This time Philomusus and Studioso are persuaded and abandon , at least for a while , the path to Parnassus . Before it \\'s too late , Philomusus and Studioso have come to their senses , have decided to leave the amorous land of poetry . They continue on , and meet a character who is former student , Ingenioso . He tries to discourage Philomusus and Studioso from their pilgrimage by telling them that there is nothing but poverty on Mount Parnassus . Dromo enters drawing on a clown by a rope , because he feels that every play needs a clown . They finally arrive at the foothills of Mount Parnassus , and take a moment to gaze up at it in a spirit of celebration . Studioso invites the audience to applaud . Synopsis of The Return from Parnassus Cast Studioso Philomusus Consiliodorus Ingenioso Luxurioso Gullio Leonarde Draper Tayler Simson Parcevall Boy to Luxurioso Boy to Studioso Stage Keeper Consiliodorus , father to Philomusus and uncle to Studioso is meeting with a messenger , Leonarde , who will deliver a letter to Philomusus and Studioso . He sent those two young men to on a journey seven years ago , and now expects results . Consiliodorus exits as Philomusus and Studioso enter , both bemoaning that since leaving Parnassus fate has n\\'t been kind , and the world is not a fruitful place for scholars . They meet a former student , Ingenioso , who tells them he has been living by the printing house and selling pamphlets . Now he is pursuing the support of a patron . The patron appears , and Ingenioso offers him immortality through his verse . Ingenioso then offers the patron a pamphlet that is dedicated to him . The patron glances at it , gives Ingenioso two small coins , and exits . Ingenioso , alone , is furious with the patron \\'s miserliness . Philomusus and Studioso reenter to hear how it went . Ingenioso now plans to go to London and live by the printers trade . Philomusus and Studioso decide to go along , and include Luxuioso , who has also left Parnassus to go to London . The four , now former students , take a moment to bid farewell to Parnassus . The Draper and the Tayler , local businessmen both complain that they trusted Philomusus and Studioso , did some draping and tailoring , and Philomusus and Studioso ran away owing them money . The tapsters has a similar problem with another former student , Luxuioso . Philomusus and Studioso meet up , both complain of the lowly jobs they have taken , Philomusus is a sexton/gravedigger , and Studioso is a household servant , farmhand , waiter and tutor . Percevall enters with a grave-digging job for Philomusus . Percevall wants Philomusus to quickly dig a grave for his father , who may not be dead yet , but will be very soon . He also wants Philomusus to write out the soon-to-be-dead father \\'s will so that Percevall will inherit his fortune . Next Studioso enters with the boy he is tutoring , and attempts to give a lesson in Latin grammar . Then Luxurio and a boy enter , on the way to a fair . Luxurio has written some poems and plans to sell them at the fair by having the boy recite them . They give a demonstration . Ingenioso has found a kind of patron in Gullio , a character that is partly based on Thomas Nashe \\'s portrait of \" an upstart \" in his pamphlet Pierce Penniless . Gullio \" maintains \" Ingenioso very neglectfully . Foppishly dressed Gullio falsely boasts of being a valiant , noble and romantic character . Ingenioso offers himself as a poet to memorialize Gullio in sonnets . Gullio then persuades Ingenioso to impersonate his mistress , Lesbia , while Gullio rehearses love poetry that Gullio himself has written and derived from Shakespeare \\'s Romeo and Juliet and Venus and Adonis . Gullio plans to eventually recite these verses as part of his wooing of Lesbia . In the next scene , Consiliodorus , father to Philomusus , uncle to Studioso , who funded their journey to Parnassus meets with the carrier and horse-back messenger Leonarde . Leonarde reports that he scolded Philomusus and Studioso and reminded them that their nurturing was costly . Leonarde thinks they may have found jobs as clerks . Consiliodorus is disappointed they are not doing as well as they should be doing . Ingenioso composes amorous verses in the styles of Chaucer , Spenser , and William Shakespeare , the last alone being to the patron \\'s satisfaction . Gullio , a great admirer of \" sweet Mr . Shakespeare \" , says he will obtain a picture of him for his study and will \" worship sweet Mr Shakespeare and to honour him will lay his Venus and Adonis under my pillow , as we read of one – I do not well remember his name , but I \\'m sure he was a king – slept with Homer under his bed \\'s head \" . Percevall enters . He has a new position as the church warden and is now referred to as Mr . Warden . He \\'s looking for the Sexton , who is Philomusus . Philomusus has n\\'t been doing a good job as Sexton , and Perceval informs him he is no longer the Sexton . Studioso then enters , he has also lost his position , which was to be tutor to a young boy and perform other household tasks . These two protagonists have reached a depth of hopeless misery ill-equipped for a world that does not appreciate scholars . At least they have each other , as they dejectedly agree to go wandering off in poverty together . Ingenioso \\'s foolish patron , Gullio , had asked Ingenioso to write and deliver poetic messages to a young woman . This goes badly , Gullio blames Ingenioso , and yet another former scholar , Ingenioso , loses his position . Rather than go wandering off like Studioso and Philomusus , Ingenioso resorts , once again , to pamphleteering for the popular press . Luxurio appears along with the boy . Luxurio \\'s attempt to sell his poems has not been fruitful , and he is now broke . He bids farewell to poetry . He intends to go away , drink the world dry , as he accepts his status as a beggar . Synopsis of The Return from Parnassus ; Or the Scourge of Simony Cast Ingenioso Judicio Danter Philomusus Studioso Furur Poeticus Phantasma Patient Richardetto Theodore Burgess Jaques Academico Amoretto Page Signor Immerito Stercutio Sir Raderick Recorder Page Prodigo Burbage Kempe Fiddlers Patient \\'s Man ( and others in the prologue ) Before the play begins , Studioso and Philomusus travelled to Rome with the expectation of becoming rich , but they discovered that expatriate Englishmen do n\\'t live as well as they had hoped . They then travelled around , and tried various honest jobs , but now they have run out of such opportunities , and must therefore turn to dishonest work . They establish a medical practice in London , with Philomusus masquerading as a fashionable French doctor , but they end that charade in time to avoid arrest . Ingenioso has now become a satirist . On the excuse of discussing a recently published collection of extracts from contemporary poetry , John Bodenham \\'s Belvedere , he briefly criticises a number of writers of the day , including Edmund Spenser , Henry Constable , Michael Drayton , John Davies , John Marston , Christopher Marlowe , Ben Jonson , Shakespeare , and Thomas Nashe ; the last of whom is referred to as dead . Ingenioso attempts to sell a book to Danter , who is a printer . ( He is based on an actual person , John Danter . ) Ingenioso \\'s last book lost money , but his new one is more promising , it \\'s about cuckolds in Cambridge . Needing employment , Academico finds his old friend from college , Amaretto , whose father , Sir Raderick , has a position as a parson to offer . But Amoretto has just accepted a bribe to give it to Immerito . Amoretto pretends not to recognize Academico , and gets rid of him by an off-putting and lengthy discourse regarding technicalities of hunting . Immerito is examined by Sir Radeerick and the Recorder , who find him educated and pliable enough for the job . This practice of selling church positions is \" simony \" , which is referred to in the subtitle of this play . Sir Raderick is worried about certain libels written about his family , which are going around in London . They are being written in verse by Furor Poeticus at the encouragement of Ingenioso . A confrontation occurs between the poets and sir Raderick , after he has taken possession of Prodigo \\'s forfeited land . Studioso and Philomusus attempt other jobs . They apply to Richard Burbage \\'s theatre hoping to becoming actors , but they realize that actors do n\\'t get paid enough . They are engaged by a company of fiddlers , but their first performance is at the front door of Sir Raderick \\'s house . The pages of Sir Raderick and Amoretto pretend to be their masters , and dismiss the fiddlers with out payment . At last , Studioso and Philomusus decide to work as shepherds in Kent , while Ingenioso and Furor have to escape to the Isle of Dogs . Academico goes back to Cambridge . Authorship It is not known who wrote them or if they were all the work of one person . John Day was suggested as a possible author by Bolton Corney in 1868 , based on a copy of the 1606 quarto , on which was hand-written , \" To my Lovinge Smallocke J : D : \" , and also based on Corney \\'s comparison of the handwriting , and on personal connections that Day had as a Cambridge man . But the suggestion has had little support . Some clues to the author \\'s identity are offered in the prologue to the second play , The Return from Parnassus , but they are not enough to make an identification . Who ever the author was , the plays indicate that he was intelligent , observant and well read . The author appears to have included a self-portrait in the guise of the character \" Judicio \" , who appears in third play and comments on a number of contemporary poets . Dating The three pieces were evidently performed at Christmas of different years , not later than Christmas 1602 , because of the references to Queen Elizabeth I , who died in March 1603 . The first play , Pilgrimage to Parnassus can not have been written earlier than 1598 , because it mentions books that were not printed until that year . The prologue of the third play , The Return from Parnassus : Or the Scourge of Simony , states that that play had been written for the preceding year , so the year 1601 seems credible for the writing of the last play of the trilogy . Shakespeare in the text of the Parnassus plays William Shakespeare is alluded to often , and his works are quoted by one count at least 95 times in the three Parnassus plays . He is explicitly mentioned by name in the last two plays . At almost every turn he is satirized or mocked , which is to be expected in a satire , and also when the target of the satire has become very successful and well known . The Parnassus plays are seen , at least in part , as extending the war of words that had been occurring between the university men and those who were not part of that group . The university men would include Cambridge alumni Thomas Nashe and Robert Greene , who both had attacked Shakespeare in print : Nashe in his pamphlet , Pierce Penniless , and Greene in Greene \\'s Groats-Worth of Wit . Shakespeare had replied in turn with some mockery of Nashe in his play Loves Labours Lost . Shakespeare and his theatre company , were on tour probably in 1601 , and visited Oxford and Cambridge , sometime between the performances of parts two and three of the trilogy . This is indicated on the title-page of the first quarto of Hamlet ( 1603 ) , where the play is said to have been acted \" in the two Universities . \" Just such a troupe of low-born actors is described in The Return to Parnassus ; the Scourge of Simony , as they might be seen from the point-of-view of competitive and envious young scholars : England affords those glorious vagabonds That carried earst their fardels on their backes , Coursers to ride on through the gazing streetes , Sooping it in their glaring Satten sutes , And Pages to attend their Maisterships : With mouthing words that better wits have framed , They purchase lands , and now Esquiers are namde . A tone of bitter mockery is established as Philomusus and Studiosus , out of desperation , audition for the professional stage , and are judged by Richard Burbage and Will Kemp , two important members of Shakespeare \\'s company , the Lord Chamberlain \\'s Men , who find humor in the deficiencies of scholars not only as actors but also as dramatists : KEMPE : The slaves are somewhat proud , and besides it is a good sport in a part to see them never speak in their walk , but at the end of the stage , just as though in walking with a fellow we should never speak but at a stile , a gate , or a ditch , where a man can go no further… . BURBAGE : A little teaching will mend these faults , and it may be besides they will be able to pen a part . KEMPE : Few of the University [ men ] plaies well , they smell too much of that writer Ovid , and that writer Metamorphosis , and talk too much of Proserpina and Jupiter . Why heres our fellow Shakespeare puts them all downe , I and Ben Jonson too . O that Ben Jonson is a pestilent fellow , he brought up Horace giving the poets a pill , but our fellow Shakespeare hath given him a purge that made him bewray his credit . This well-known passage is bitterly ironic : The author of the Parnassus plays is holding up to scorn — for an academic audience — the opinions of two illiterate fools , Burbage and Kempe , who think that Metamorphosis is a writer , and that their colleague , Shakespeare , puts the university playwrights to shame . The audition piece Philomusus is asked to perform is taken from Shakespeare \\'s play , Richard III : \" Now is the winter of our discontent , made glorious summer by this son of York . \" In this part of the trilogy , Shakespeare is seen as a poet , and also as a dramatist and actor . In the second play , The Return from Parnasus , the character named Gullio , who is lovesick and a fool , is mocked for his worshipful devotion to \" pure Shakspeare and shreds of poetry that he hath gathered at the theaters . \" When Gullio later cries out , \" O sweet Mr . Shakspeare ! I \\'ll have his picture in my study at the court , \" it suggests that young scholars who appreciated Shakespeare \\'s writing , also had a regard for his person . The author of the Parnassus plays has the character Judico comment on a number of poets , and he considers Shakespeare : Who loves not Adons love , or Lucrece rape ? His sweeter verse contaynes hart throbbing line , Could but a graver subject him content Without loves foolish lazy languishment . Apparently he admires the language and verse in Shakespeare \\'s early poems , but suggests that Shakespeare may have been wasting his talent by writing love poetry . This faint praise of Shakespeare the actor-poet contrasts with the greater praise he gives to Drayton , Nashe and others . Identifying allusions The question of whether or not the characters are meant to represent actual persons , and if so to what extent , has been much discussed . Much of the speculation centering around the London literary scene . However , sustained reference to the London scene , is not a part of the first play , but enters into the trilogy only for the second and third parts . It is thought that by the time the final part was written the author may have more or less identified Ingenioso with Nashe , though the character was not originally conceived with this intention . Ingenioso does speak in praise of Nashe , who died in 1601 . The author of the plays was evidently very familiar with Nashe \\'s works , and all three parts are full of reminiscences of Nashe \\'s writings . In the third play Ingenioso announces that he is in trouble for the plays he has written , and he exits saying , \" now I am bound for the Ile of doggs … Fare well . \" A notorious dramatic satire titled The Isle of Dogs , written by Nashe and Ben Jonson , and performed in 1597 , was considered so slanderous that the Privy Council gave in to pressure from the City government and demanded theatrical performances be stopped and that London \\'s playhouses be torn down . It is thought that the two students , Studioso and Philomusus are in part portrayals of Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd . Of course Shakespeare never attended university , but for the students there might be some satiric pleasure in imagining such a character attempting Cambridge , meeting failure , and in the end being forced to return to the country life from whence he came , as occurs in the plays . It is thought that \" Furor Poeticus \" represents John Marston , and \" Luxurio \" represents Gabriel Harvey . The courtier Gullio is not only a character in the play but is used to satirize Shakespeare \\'s patron the Earl of Southampton , who also attended St . John \\'s . Southampton would not have attended the performance in 1601 , he was at the time under sentence of death for his part in the Essex conspiracy . The printer Danter , who appears in the third play , is based on a real printer named John Danter , who is noted for printing the piratical first quarto of Romeo and Juliet , as well as other plays and texts . The college recorder , Francis Brackyn was an actual person , who is harshly satirized in The Return from Parnassus : Or the Scourge of Simony as the character \" Recorder \" . Brackyn had been ridiculed in another university play , Club Rules , and would be yet again as the title character in Ignoramus . Printing history The third play , The Return from Parnassus ; the Scourge of Simony , was published twice in 1606 — four years after its original performance— with many textual variations between the two editions . It was reprinted in the 18th Century , and again in 1879 . The third play was the only part that was published , and for many years the first two plays were considered lost . Then in 1886 W . D . Macray , the librarian of the Bodleian Library at Oxford , discovered the lost plays , while he was doing research among the manuscripts collected by Thomas Hearne , which are part of the Richard Rawlinson collection at the Bodleian Library . Macray immediately edited and published all three plays together . The handwritten manuscripts of the first two plays consist of twenty folio leaves , and were written imperfectly by a copyist who may have had trouble at times reading his original . A handwritten manuscript of the third play , The Return from Parnassus , or the Scourge of Simony , also exists . It was found in an old family library , according to Macray . The handwriting indicates that it is contemporary with the play \\'s first performances . It is a small quarto volume , bound in parchment . The manuscript is housed in the Folger Shakespeare Library . Study of the handwritten manuscript of the third play , owned by James Halliwell-Phillipps , has helped to correct a number of errors that exist in the early printed editions . A reading A rehearsed reading of the Return from Parnassus , or The Scourge of Simony was performed 6 December 2009 as part of Shakespeare \\'s Globe Theatre \\'s Read Not Dead series . The cast included David Oakes as Ingenious and Kevin Quarmby as Burbage . References External links Text of the Parnassus plays on-line . Oxford Clarendon Press .

It details his very early childhood in Brooklyn , New York , US but focuses primarily on his life in Limerick , Ireland . It also includes his struggles with poverty and his father \\'s alcoholism . The book was published in 1996 and won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography . A sequel , \\'T is , was published in 1999 , followed by Teacher Man in 2005 . Synopsis The narrative is told from the point of view of Frank McCourt as a child . Born in Brooklyn , New York , on 19 August 1930 , Frank ( Francis ) McCourt is the oldest son of Malachy McCourt and Angela Sheehan McCourt . Both of his parents immigrated from Ireland and married in a shotgun wedding over Angela \\'s pregnancy with Frankie . Angela is from Limerick , Ireland , and is fond of music , singing , and dancing . Malachy , from Northern Ireland , is an alcoholic known for his \" odd manner \" and for telling the stories about Irish heroes . Frankie is said to resemble his father , having a hang-dog face and the same \" odd manner . \" In Brooklyn , the McCourts live in modern tenement housing next to a park and share a floor , and an indoor lavatory , with other immigrant families . Frankie has four younger siblings in Brooklyn : Malachy , born in 1931 ; twins Oliver and Eugene , born in 1932 ; and an infant sister , Margaret , in 1935 . The family struggles with poverty because Malachy Sr. \\'s efforts to find work are complicated by his alcoholism . The family \\'s prospects , and Angela \\'s spirits , lift whenever he finds a new job and brings home his wages , but soon he finds himself spending all of his pay packet in pubs , despite Angela \\'s efforts to prevent him from doing so . He loses each job after a few weeks as a result of his heavy drinking . Margaret \\'s birth instills new life into the family : the whole family falls in love with her , Malachy Sr most of all . He stops drinking and finds steady work to support the family . Due to her parents \\' ignorance of childhood disease , Margaret lives for only seven weeks . With her death , Malachy Sr goes on an alcoholic binge , while Angela suffers severe depression . Frank , age four , feeds and cares for his younger siblings , until the neighbours help out . The neighbours contact Angela \\'s cousins , who in turn recommend the family return to Ireland . Angela is pregnant as they return to Ireland from America , though she loses the child shortly after moving to Limerick . The Great Depression strikes Ireland even harder than it does the United States . The family first goes to Malachy \\'s family home in Toome in County Antrim , where his parents tell them there is no work . He tries Dublin , hoping for a pension from his fighting days , but that does not materialise . They settle in Angela \\'s original hometown , Limerick . Conditions for poor families are miserable . Malachy Sr finds it difficult to find work because of his Northern Irish accent and mannerisms , and the boys are mocked for their American accents . The family is forced to rely on the dole and charity from the local Society of Saint Vincent de Paul , which requires a humiliating application process . Angela and Malachy Sr argue about this as Malachy drinks the welfare money meant to feed the family , and views Angela \\'s asking for charity as degrading . The young family subsists on little more than bread and tea . Within a year of the family \\'s arrival , Oliver and Eugene also die . Oliver dies first , and then Eugene , a few months later , from grieving the loss of his twin and pneumonia . After each death , Angela is depressed , and the family moves to another house . Each move is a slide into worse circumstances . They settle in a slum house . The entire ground floor floods for half the year , requiring the family to live in the upstairs rooms , called Italy , until the rains cease , when they again have access to the ground floor , Ireland . Their house is next to the only lavatory on the street . The traffic of families dumping chamber pots in the lavatory is offensive . Two more baby brothers , Michael ( born 1936 ) , and Alphie ( Alphonsus Joseph , b . 1940 ) , are born in Limerick . Frankie grows up in Limerick as an intelligent boy , if always hungry . He makes unique observations about those around him . His strict Catholic upbringing in the local public school preys on him ; will he be going to hell , this plagues his mind as soon as he has been taught to make confession aged seven . He sees his father as three people ; the man who rises early in the morning and talks with Frank ; the man who tells stories to his sons in the evening ; and the man who drinks too much , sings old songs and asks his young sons promise to die for Ireland . Frank gets typhoid fever at age ten and is taken to the hospital for months , where for the first time he has adequate food , warmth , and clean sheets , and access to books with the time to read them . Frankie contracts chronic conjunctivitis the next year , which does not heal , requiring treatments . When the US joins World War II , many Limerick men , including Malachy Sr , find work at defence plants in Coventry , England , and send money home . The first payment from Malachy Sr . allows the family to buy food and pay the rent . But soon , the money stops coming , and at age 11 , Frank is the man of the house . When their mother is ill , Frank and his brothers steal leftover food from restaurants and grocery deliveries from doorsteps of wealthier homes , until they are sent to stay with their aunt while their mother recuperates in the hospital . After a humorous few weeks of burning the second floor wall for the cooking fire , the family is evicted and homeless . At her mother \\'s suggestion , Angela and her children move in with her bachelor cousin , Laman Griffin ; who is a petty tyrant , not pleasant company . Frank endures this treatment until the day after his schooling ends in June and he is promised the loan of Laman \\'s bicycle to join his friends ; Laman reneges on his promise . Added to this disappointment , Laman \\'s deal to provide housing includes a sexual relationship with Angela . Frankie fights with Laman and is thrown out of the house . Shortly after , Malachy Jr leaves Laman Griffin \\'s to join the British military as a bugle boy . Frankie moves in with his maternal uncle , a simple man who was \" dropped on his head as a child \" and lives alone in the house . Frank gets a job as a telegram delivery boy on his fourteenth birthday in August and enjoys his first real wages . He meets many unexpected situations while delivering telegrams , including his first girlfriend , who dies of tuberculosis . He meets Mrs Finucane who buys clothes for people at a discount , and then they pay her back over time for the full price ; she asks Frank to write threatening letters to encourage them to repay those loans . He tells no one about this job , which he has until she dies . A few months after he moves , the rest of the family follows him to the house . Frank now turns over the majority of his wages to his mother . He works for the post office until he is sixteen , when he finds a job with Eason \\'s , a company that supplies magazines and newspapers to Limerick stores . On his sixteenth birthday , Frank \\'s uncle takes him to the pub to buy him his first beer . Frank gets drunk and heads home . When his mother shames him for drinking like his father , Frank hits her , accusing her of being a whore for Laman Griffin , and is immediately ashamed of himself . Shortly before he turns nineteen , Frank returns to Mrs . Finucane ’ s home to find she has died . Frank takes some of the money from her purse and throws her ledger of debtors into the river to free the neighborhood of their debts . This gives him enough money to sail to New York . Frank arrives in Poughkeepsie , New York where the ship docks , and he agrees with a ship \\'s crew man that it is a great country , \\'t is .

Literary significance and reception Michiko Kakutani concluded her review in The New York Times of Angela \\'s Ashes by saying that \" The reader of this stunning memoir can only hope that Mr . McCourt will set down the story of his subsequent adventures in America in another book . Angela \\'s Ashes is so good it deserves a sequel . \" McCourt \" has used the storytelling gifts he inherited from his father to write a book that redeems the pain of his early years with wit and compassion and grace . \" The book is compared \" with The Liars Club by Mary Karr and Andre Aciman \\'s Out of Egypt as a classic modern memoir . \" McCourt writes without bitterness about his epic tale of woe , though \" there is plenty a less generous writer might well be judgmental about . \" The review is peppered with quotations from the book showing the author \\'s style . Kakutani remarks that \" Writing in prose that \\'s pictorial and tactile , lyrical but streetwise , Mr . McCourt does for the town of Limerick what the young Joyce did for Dublin : he conjures the place for us with such intimacy that we feel we \\'ve walked its streets and crawled its pubs . \" This review is strong in its analysis of the book as well-written and modern , comparable with great writers . The scope of the \" memoir is not just the story of his family \\'s struggles , but the story of his own sentimental education : his discovery of poetry and girls , and his efforts to come to terms with God and death and faith . By 11 , he \\'s the chief breadwinner for the family . By 15 , he \\'s lost his first girlfriend to tuberculosis . By 19 , he \\'s saved enough money to make his escape to the States . \" In its review , Kirkus Reviews has strong praise : \" An extraordinary work in every way . McCourt magically retrieves love , dignity , and humor from a childhood of hunger , loss and pain . \" This is the first book by McCourt . It is \" a powerful , exquisitely written debut , a recollection of the author \\'s miserable childhood in the slums of Limerick , Ireland , during the Depression and World War II . \" Nina King wrote in the Washington Post that \" This memoir is an instant classic of the genre -- all the more remarkable for being the 66-year-old McCourt \\'s first book . \" She summarized her review by saying that \" Angela \\'s Ashes confirms the worst old stereotypes about the Irish , portraying them as drunken , sentimental , bigoted , bloody-minded dreamers , repressed sexually and oppressed politically , nursing ancient grievances while their children ( their far-too-many children ) go hungry . ... at the same time that it transcends them through the sharpness and precision of McCourt \\'s observation and the wit and beauty of his prose . \" Reviewing the book at its publication in 1996 , John Blades wrote in the Chicago Tribune that \" Like McCourt himself , Angela \\'s Ashes is a bundle of contradictions , as uproarious as they are grievous , whether the young Frankie is pushing his baby brother around Limerick , dumping loose coal and turf into his pram ; his \" pious , defeated \" mother is begging a sheep \\'s head for their Christmas dinner ; or his soused father is rousing the boys in the middle of the night to sing \" Kevin Barry \" and other patriotic Irish songs . \" The book event was held in at the Mercury Theater and the adjoining Chicago bar ; the book is a debut for McCourt but he had \" been a familiar figure on local stages during the \\'80s . Billing themselves as \" A Couple of Blaguards , \" he and his younger brother , Malachy , re-enacted their Limerick boyhood in story , song and verse for audiences at the Royal George and other theaters . \" McCourt \\'s book places \" McCourt \\'s mother , Angela , [ as ] the nominal heroine of his memoir , eternally on the dole , pathetically trying to clothe and feed her sons . But it \\'s the blackguard father , also named Malachy , who obsesses McCourt , and who commandeers center stage in his memoir , long after he \\'s abandoned his wife and family . \" At the book event , McCourt notes that most of the reviews of his memoir call it \" lyrical and charming , \" but he says that \" what gives Irish writing its distinctive flavor is not the charming stuff but the darkness . \" In a review of the book and its audio book version released in 1997 , Gayle Sims wrote that it is \" only book that I unequivocally recommend listening to instead of reading . \" She explains why the narration makes a better experience than reading on paper , as the author \" reads the narrative in his everyday dialect , yet he is able to give it the voice of a child . This works particularly well because Angela \\'s Ashes is written from a child \\'s unjudging perspective . \" Although the tough , challenging and sad events of his childhood might present a negative story to the reader or listener , \" The book is full of tears and laughter . McCourt is forgiving of his family \\'s tragic life . When he reads , there is no rancor in his voice . \" Writing a review in 2020 , Ashley Nelson said that \" This story is challenging to the emotions ; it deals with many elements and situations that make people uncomfortable . However , it has you holding back laughter , as Frank McCourt has this magical ability to make light of being starving in the pouring rain walking through the streets of Limerick . This book has you feel love , loss , fear , hunger , and the will to overcome uncertainty . \" This book is a \" quintessential coming of age story viewed through the grimy , unyielding , and sometimes downright heartbreaking lens of poverty . It follows Frank McCourt as he comically explains the dire circumstances of his conception , birth , and life . \" Background After traveling to America ( where the book ends ) , Frank ended up working at the Biltmore Hotel in New York City , where he remained until 1951 . Frank was drafted during the Korean War to be stationed in Bavaria , Germany . After being discharged , Frank returned to New York and dabbled with several different jobs until he was accepted into NYU . After graduating in 1957 with a bachelor \\'s degree in English , McCourt turned to teaching in New York schools . He then obtained his master \\'s degree and traveled to Dublin in pursuit of his PhD , which he never completed . Awards Angela \\'s Ashes won several awards , including the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography , the 1996 National Book Critics Circle Award ( Biography ) , and the 1997 Boeke Prize . Frank McCourt was elected Irish American of the Year in 1998 . Disputed memories McCourt was accused of exaggerating his family \\'s impoverished upbringing by many Limerick natives , including Richard Harris . McCourt \\'s mother denied the accuracy of his stories shortly before her death in 1981 , walking out of a stage performance by her two elder sons ; Malachy \\'s recollection is that she said it was \" all a pack of lies . \" Local writer and filmmaker Gerry Hannan has compiled a list of 204 inaccuracies in Angela \\'s Ashes , most notably that McCourt claims that Willie Harrold charged people to watch his sisters undressing , but Harrold had no sisters ; that McCourt \\'s claim to have had a sexual relationship with Teresa Carmody tarnishes the name of a girl who died young ; that McCourt never worked as a telegraph boy ; and that the McCourts never lived with Laman ( Gerry ) Griffin . McCourt is accused of hating the \" pillars \" of Limerick city , especially the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul , the Catholic Church and Munster Rugby . Hannan confronted McCourt on The Late Late Show in 1999 . McCourt was a member of the Boy Scouts , a middle-class pursuit the poor could not afford , and family photographs show the children and Angela as well-fed . American journalist John Meyer visited Limerick and took the tour of the city sparked by publication of the book . He realized how much the city had changed since McCourt \\'s childhood years , including destruction of the slum area where his family lived when Frank was in school . McCourt described the book as \" a memoir , not an exact history \" , and admitted to fabricating the story about Willie Harrold \\'s sisters . Similarly , Alan Parker , who directed the film version , said that Angela \\'s Ashes \" was a work of art which met Gore Vidal \\'s definition of autobiography , being an \\'impression \\' of a life , rather than a memoir . \" Adaptations Film In 1999 a film version was released . It was co-written and directed by Alan Parker starring Joe Breen , Ciaran Owens , and Michael Legge , as the Young , Middle and Older Frank McCourt respectively and Emily Watson as McCourt \\'s mother Angela , Robert Carlyle as the father . The film begins when the McCourt family move back to Ireland after experiencing hardship in America . Many of the Street scenes were filmed in Cork , Ireland . The film soundtrack was composed and conducted by John Williams , and features songs by Billie Holiday and Sinéad O\\'Connor . Musical A stage musical adaptation of Angela \\'s Ashes by Adam Howell ( Music & Lyrics ) and Paul Hurt ( Book ) received its world premiere at the Lime Tree Theatre , Limerick on July 6 , 2017 with following performances at the Bord Gáis Energy Theatre , Dublin and the Grand Opera House , Belfast . McCourt \\'s wife , Ellen Frey McCourt , remarked about making a musical from that memoir , before it opened in Limerick , that \" “ The movie does not have the humour of the book , or that this musical has . ” Moreover , she adds , “ if you think about it , was Sweeney Todd a good example of a musical subject ? Or Oliver ! , or Annie ? There ’ s a silver lining in each of these shows , and Angela ’ s Ashes is really a story about a family triumphing over adversity . ” \" See also Misery lit References Further reading Hagan , Edward A . “ Really an Alley Cat ?

It is a term used in early 20th century continental philosophy , especially in the works of Martin Heidegger , Jean-Paul Sartre , Simone de Beauvoir , and the existentialists . Being-in-itself for Heidegger In the philosophy of Martin Heidegger , Being-in-itself is contrasted with the being of persons , which he terms Dasein . \" Dasein means : care of the Being of beings as such that is ecstatically disclosed in care , not only of human Being ... Dasein is itself by virtue of its essential relation to Being in general . \" Heidegger recognized the dangers inherent to talking about Being in general and particular beings , and thus devoted space in Being and Time and the Introduction to Metaphysics to an explication of the differences ; often noted by translators who distinguish Being ( Sein ) , from a being ( das Seiende ) . His attention to the complication is helpful for those who are looking for detailed explanation , but rarely clears the air of confusions . Dasein is Being that is aware of , and interested in , its own Being . Dasein is , by its nature , invested in social interaction and society . This is because in Heidegger \\'s metaphysical system , one of the most fundamental ways to understand Being is through relationships . All things stand in a relation to all other things — and by virtue of his stress on Dasein \\'s ontological distinction , things may also stand in relation to Dasein . The argument for this claim draws heavily on Hegel \\'s great work , the Phenomenology of Spirit . Essentially , Being in itself is one of Heidegger \\'s main concerns throughout his authorship . Despite Heidegger \\'s interest in it , he returns — more often than not indirectly — to the subject by interrogating other concepts that simply invoke Being without explicitly acknowledging it . In other words , whereas Heidegger calls the being of persons \\'Dasein \\' , he determines \\'Being in itself \\' to be at the same time the most vague and general concept possible to contemplate , but also the topic of greatest interest to him as a philosopher . Being-in-itself for Sartre In Sartrean existentialism , being-in-itself ( être-en-soi ) is also contrasted with the being of persons , which he describes as a combination of , or vacillation or tension between , being-for-itself ( être-pour-soi ) and being-for-others ( I\\'être-pour-autrui ) . Being-in-itself refers to objects in the external world — a mode of existence that simply is . It is not conscious so it is neither active nor passive and harbors no potentiality for transcendence . This mode of being is relevant to inanimate objects , but not to humans , who Sartre says must always make a choice . One of the problems of human existence for Sartre is the desire to attain being-in-itself , which he describes as the desire to be God — this is a longing for full control over one \\'s destiny and for absolute identity , only attainable by achieving full control over the destiny of all existence . The desire to be God is one of the ways people fall into bad faith . Sartre \\'s famous depiction of a man in a café who has applied himself to a portrayal of his role as a waiter illustrates this . The waiter thinks of himself as being a waiter ( as in being-in-itself ) , which Sartre says is impossible since he can not be a waiter in the sense that an inkwell is an inkwell . He is primarily a man ( being-for-itself ) , just one who happens to be functioning as a waiter – with no fixed nature or essence , who is constantly recreating himself . He is guilty of focusing on himself as being-in-itself and not being-for-itself . Sartre would say that as a human , a being-for-itself by nature , the waiter is \" a being that is not what it is and it is what it is not . \" Therefore , the waiter who acts as if he is at his very core a waiter \" is not what [ he ] is \" - which is to say , he is not solely a waiter- and \" is what [ he ] is not \" - meaning that he is many things other than a waiter . In simply playing the part of a waiter , the man in this example is reducing himself to a \" being-in-itself \" and is therefore in bad faith .

Creator Ron Koslow \\'s updated version of the fairy tale has a double focus : the relationship between Vincent ( Ron Perlman ) , a mythic , noble man-beast , and Catherine ( Linda Hamilton ) , a savvy Assistant District Attorney in New York , and a secret utopian community of social outcasts living in a subterranean sanctuary . Through an empathetic bond , Vincent senses Catherine \\'s emotions , and becomes her guardian . Premise The series follows the developing relationship between the characters and the division between New York and the hidden world beneath it . In a twist from the original tale , however , this \" beast \" does not transform into society \\'s idea of beauty after gaining the love of Catherine . Rather , Vincent \\'s inner beauty is allowed to remain the focus of who he is , and it is Catherine \\'s life that transforms from her relationship to Vincent . In the third season after the death of the character Catherine , Jo Anderson became the new female lead playing Diana Bennett , a criminal profiler investigating Catherine \\'s murder . Production As the title indicates , the premise of the series is inspired by the fairy tale \" Beauty and the Beast \" ; in particular , there is some connection to the Jean Cocteau \\'s 1946 French film , La Belle et la Bête . George R . R . Martin , who would later write the A Song of Ice and Fire book series which were later adapted into the acclaimed television series Game of Thrones , was a writer and producer on the show . In 2004 and 2007 , Beauty and the Beast was ranked # 14 and # 17 , respectively , on TV Guides Top Cult Shows Ever . Series synopsis Season 1 Catherine Chandler ( played by Linda Hamilton ) is abducted , beaten , slashed and left to die in Central Park because she was inadvertently mistaken for somebody else . She is rescued and cared for by Vincent ( played by Ron Perlman ) who has taken her to Father ( played by Roy Dotrice ) , head of a hidden community of people dwelling in tunnels below the city of New York . Ten days later , Catherine returns to the surface with the promise of keeping Vincent \\'s secret and the challenge to go on after her terrible attack . After completing her recovery , her life begins a serious transition : she takes self-defense lessons , leaves her comfortable job at her father \\'s law firm and joins the Manhattan District Attorney \\'s office as an assistant district attorney . Her first action involves her asking Carol Stabler about those men who attacked her , where she states that they were part of an illegal escort service run by Martin Belmont . When Catherine is attacked by Martin Belmont \\'s men , she is saved by Vincent , who mauls the men . During the course of the first season , the production team fashioned a blend of romance and crime drama , which used both Catherine \\'s position as an ADA and her will to help Vincent and his world to place her in moments of physical danger that would bring the idealized romantic figure of Vincent to the surface world as her guardian angel . Season 2 During its second season , the series shifted its focus slightly to add more character development , as the central characters spent considerable time exploring their relationships with the inhabitants of the Tunnel World , where Catherine had finally been accepted as a friend and \" Helper \" ( someone who assists the Tunnel community with what they need to survive and by keeping their secret ) . More people from the World Above turned up for emotional support and healing in the secure environment of the World Below . Near the end of the season , however , in an effort to boost faltering ratings , the action orientation returned as a result of the misleadings of the recurrent villain Paracelsus ( played by Tony Jay ) . In a cliffhanger final episode , Catherine is seen walking down a tunnel into a chamber , where Vincent is suffering from a violent madness . Season 3 When the series returned for its abbreviated third season late in 1989 , Linda Hamilton had announced her decision to leave the series as she was pregnant at the time . It was a decision that , along with the network \\'s desire to attract more male viewers , would have serious repercussions for the show \\'s continued survival . In the resolution to the previous season \\'s cliffhanger , Catherine rescued Vincent from his inner demons but was kidnapped by a man named Gabriel ( played by Stephen McHattie ) , the ruthless head of a huge criminal empire she had been investigating , which was trying to corrupt the D.A . \\'s office . She was killed , but not before giving birth to Vincent \\'s son , who was held hostage by the evil Gabriel . Catherine \\'s boss and close friend Joe Maxwell ( Jay Acovone ) hired Diana Bennett ( Jo Anderson ) , a criminal profiler with the police department , to track down Catherine \\'s killer . Quite naturally , her investigation ultimately led her to the now darkly obsessed and grieving Vincent . Although still popular with its dedicated fans , the darker , more resolutely violent aspects of the reworked concept , coupled with the fatal loss of the all-important central relationship between Catherine and Vincent , led to further declining ratings and , ultimately , cancellation . Characters Main cast Catherine Chandler ( portrayed by Linda Hamilton ) – A corporate attorney in her father \\'s law firm . After she \\'s abducted , beaten , and her face slashed upon being mistaken for Carol Stabler , Catherine was rescued and tended to by Vincent . After that experience , Catherine changes her life completely and becomes an investigator for the Manhattan District Attorney \\'s Office . In Season Three , Catherine becomes pregnant with Vincent \\'s child and is captured by Gabriel . She is later murdered by Gabriel who overdoses her with morphine . Vincent ( portrayed by Ron Perlman ) – A man of extremely large build with the facial characteristics of a lion ( fanged teeth , a flattened nose and a feline muzzle ) and fingers tipped with claw-like nails . He is also much stronger than ordinary humans and , when enraged , growls and roars like a lion . He wears a hooded cloak to hide his appearance from strangers while walking the city streets at night . His parentage is unknown as he was found as a baby near St Vincent \\'s Hospital and brought to Father by Paracelsus \\' wife Anna . Vincent has empathic abilities that let him know when Catherine is in danger . Following the death of Catherine , his baby son was captive in the clutches of Gabriel prompting him to take down Gabriel \\'s operations . He does end up surrendering to Gabriel when he hears that his son is ill . This leads up to a rescue mission by Diana and the rest of the \" World Below \" . Following the death of Gabriel , Vincent saves his son and names him after Father \\'s real name ; Jacob . Vincent \\'s makeup was devised by veteran Hollywood makeup artist Rick Baker . It was Baker who brought up Perlman based on his previous experiences in prosthetics and fought hard for his casting which ultimately started a long-lasting friendship between the two . Matt McColm was a stunt double for Perlman . Diana Bennett ( portrayed by Jo Anderson ) – Diana is a criminal profiler with the \" 210 Division \" of the New York Police Department , which investigates unusual cases beyond the scope of the normal police .

Elliot is presumably killed by the boat explosion which wounded Vincent . Charles Chandler ( portrayed by John McMartin ) – Catherine \\'s father who is seen in Season 1 and 2 where he runs a law firm that Catherine used to work at .

In the final battle , Vincent \\'s son is rescued as Vincent wounds Gabriel . After Gabriel mentions that no court would be able to convict him , Gabriel is then shot by Diana who avenges Catherine \\'s death using Catherine \\'s gun . Jonathan Pope ( portrayed by John Lehne ) – Gabriel \\'s right-hand man who issues out Gabriel \\'s orders . Doctor ( portrayed by Kenneth Kimmins ) – An unnamed doctor who works for Gabriel . He had the Doctor overdose Catherine with morphine following her giving birth to Vincent \\'s baby . When Gabriel revealed this to Vincent at the time when he was his prisoner , he offered Vincent revenge on the Doctor even though the Doctor stated to Vincent that Gabriel made him do it .

The \" World Below \" Jacob Wells/Father ( portrayed by Roy Dotrice ) – The patriarch of the \" World Below \" and Vincent \\'s foster father . A physician who left the \" World Above \" after being unjustly blacklisted , fired from his job , and having his license to practice medicine stripped from him , Jacob found sanctuary in an early tunnel community and became its leader .

Mouse ( portrayed by David Greenlee ) – Apparently having no other name , at least none that he remembers , he is young tunnel dweller who originally hid from the \" World Below \" community until Vincent caught him stealing some food and invited him into their family . He is infamous for stealing from the \" World Above \" , which , in his opinion , exists for no other reason than to be stolen from where he once commented \" Everyone takes things from Up Top . It \\'s what Up Top is there for \" . Mouse loves tinkering with machinery and has invented several \" gizmos \" to help his fellow tunnel dwellers . He owns a pet raccoon named Arthur . Pascal ( portrayed by Armin Shimerman ) – The shy and gentle \" pipe master \" who is the supervisor of the tunnels \\' communication system that involves the inhabitants of \" The World Below \" speaking through banging on the pipes .

Narcissa ( portrayed by Beah Richards ) – An elderly and nearly blind inhabitant of \" The World Below \" , she has resided there at least as far back as Vincent \\'s childhood . Narcissa eventually moved far from the other inhabitants into the furthest tunnels where few others venture and even Vincent \\'s knowledge of these areas does not surpass her own . She pretends to be nothing more than a senile old woman , but she is actually a skilled magician and fortune-teller . Rebecca ( portrayed Kathryn Spitz ) – A female inhabitant of \" The World Below \" and an expert candlestick maker . William ( portrayed by Ritch Brinkley ) – A heavyset man and inhabitant of \" The World Below \" who serves as their cook . His experiences in \" The World Above \" left him bitter and suspicious of almost everyone . William \\'s role as cook makes him feel needed and appreciated as \" The World Above \" never did and he is usually the first to suggest a violent response to any threat to \" The World Below \" . John Pater/Paracelsus ( portrayed by Tony Jay ) – An inhabitant of \" The World Below \" who was featured in Season 1 and 2 as a recurring antagonist . John Pater was a scientist and a former friend of Jacob Wells \\' who helped organize \" The World Below \" . But when he eventually desired power for himself , the community was forced to exile him . Father describes him as a \" philosopher , scientist , magician \" like the real Paracelsus , the name John Pater eventually takes for himself . When Jacob tries to reason with Paracelsus by calling him by his real name , he commented \" John is dead \" . Paracelsus \\' late wife Anna was the one who discovered the infant Vincent near St . Vincent \\'s Hospital and brought him to Jacob . Paracelsus tried to lead Vincent to siding with him while disguised as Jacob , but was ultimately killed by Vincent during a fit of rage . In his dying breath , Paracelsus quotes \" At last , you are my son . \" Episodes Nielsen ratings 1987–88 : # 50 ( 13.31 rating ) 1988–89 : # 69 ( 10.38 rating ) 1989–90 : # 93 ( 8.82 rating ) Note : Ratings data from TVTango.com Novelizations Avon Books published three books novelizing various episodes from the series : Beauty and the Beast by Barbara Hambly – October 1989 – , a novelization and expanding of the pilot episode Masques by Ru Emerson – September 1990 – , a novelization of the episodes \" Arabesque \" , \" Masques \" and \" The Watcher \" Song of Orpheus by Barbara Hambly – November 1990 – , a novelization of the episodes \" Fever \" , \" Song of Orpheus \" and \" Shades of Grey \" Image Pub of New York published another book based on episodes and characters from the series : Beyond Words , Beyond Silence by Nan Dibble – January 1993 – First Comics published two graphic novels based on the series written and illustrated by Wendy Pini : \" Portrait of Love \" – June 1989 – \" Night of Beauty \" – April 1990 – Home media CBS DVD ( distributed by Paramount ) has released all three seasons of Beauty and the Beast on DVD in region 1 .

Etymology and terminology Early societies relied on a gift economy based on favours . Later , as commerce developed , less permanent human relations were formed , depending more on transitory needs rather than enduring social desires . Customers are generally said to be the purchasers of goods and services , while clients are those who receive personalized advice and solutions . Although such distinctions have no contemporary semantic weight , agencies such as law firms , film studios , and health care providers tend to prefer client , while grocery stores , banks , and restaurants tend to prefer customer instead . Clients The term client is derived from Latin clients or care meaning \" to incline \" or \" to bend \" , and is related to the emotive idea of closure . It is widely believed that people only change their habits when motivated by greed and fear . Winning a client is , therefore , a singular event , which is why professional specialists who deal with particular problems tend to attract long-term clients rather than regular customers . Unlike regular customers , who buy merely on price and value , long-term clients buy on experience and trust . Customers Clients who habitually return to a seller develop customs that allow for regular , sustained commerce that allows the seller to develop statistical models to optimize production processes ( which change the nature or form of goods or services ) and supply chains ( which changes the location or formalizes the changes of ownership or entitlement transactions ) . Customer segmentation In the 21st century customers are generally categorized into two types : an entrepreneur or trader ( sometimes a commercial Intermediary ) - a dealer who purchases goods for re-sale . an end user or ultimate customer who does not re-sell the things bought but is the actual consumer or an agent such as a Purchasing officer for the consumer . A customer may or may not also be a consumer , but the two notions are distinct . A customer purchases goods ; a consumer uses them . An ultimate customer may be a consumer as well , but just as equally may have purchased items for someone else to consume . An intermediate customer is not a consumer at all . The situation is somewhat complicated in that ultimate customers of so-called industrial goods and services ( who are entities such as government bodies , manufacturers , and educational and medical institutions ) either themselves use up the goods and services that they buy , or incorporate them into other finished products , and so are technically consumers , too . However , they are rarely called that , but are rather called industrial customers or business-to-business customers . Similarly , customers who buy services rather than goods are rarely called consumers . Six Sigma doctrine places ( active ) customers in opposition to two other classes of people : not-customers and non-customers : Customers of a given business have actively dealt with that business within a particular recent period that depends on the product sold . Not-customers are either past customers who are no longer customers or potential customers who choose to interact with the competition . Non-customers are people who are active in a different market segment entirely . Geoff Tennant , a Six Sigma consultant from the United Kingdom , uses the following analogy to explain the difference : A supermarket \\'s customer is the person buying milk at that supermarket ; a not-customer buys milk from a competing supermarket , whereas a non-customer does n\\'t buy milk from supermarkets at all but rather \" has milk delivered to the door in the traditional British way \" . Tennant also categorizes customers in another way that is employed outwith the fields of marketing . While marketers , market regulation , and economists use the intermediate/ultimate categorization , the field of customer service more often categorizes customers into two classes : An external customer of an organization is a customer who is not directly connected to that organization . An internal customer is a customer who is directly connected to an organization , and is usually ( but not necessarily ) internal to the organization . Internal customers are usually stakeholders , employees , or shareholders , but the definition also encompasses creditors and external regulators . Before the introduction of the notion of an internal customer , external customers were , simply , customers . Quality-management writer Joseph M . Juran popularized the concept , introducing it in 1988 in the fourth edition of his Quality Control Handbook . The idea has since gained wide acceptance in the literature on total quality management and service marketing ; and many organizations recognize the customer satisfaction of internal customers as a precursor to , and a prerequisite for , external customer satisfaction , with authors such as regarding service organizations which design products for internal customer satisfaction as better able to satisfy the needs of external customers . Research on the theory and practice of managing the internal customer continues in a variety of service-sector industries . Arguments against use of the term \" internal customers \" Leading authors in management and marketing , like Peter Drucker , Philip Kotler , W . Edwards Deming , etc. , have not used the term \" internal customer \" in their works . They consider the \" customer \" as a very specific role in society which represents a crucial part in the relationship between the demand and the supply . Some of the most important characteristics of any customer are that : any customer is never in a subordination line with any supplier ; any customer has equal positions with the supplier within negotiations , and any customer can accept or reject any offer for a service or a product . Peter Drucker wrote , \" They are all people who can say no , people who have the choice to accept or reject what you offer . \" In opposition to the stated customer \\'s characteristics , relationships between colleagues in a company are always based on subordination – direct or indirect . Company employees are obliged to follow the processes of their companies . Company employees do not have the authority to choose a unit/colleague to fulfill any task . Company employees are obliged to use an existing unit/colleague by using the company \\'s structure and approved processes , therefore these internal relationships are not considered as an option . Many authors in ITIL and Six Sigma methodologies define \" internal customer \" as an internal part of a company that uses the output of another part of a company as its input . But actually , this definition describes better a classical internal process rather than a relationship between a customer and a supplier . Peter Drucker considers that there are no customers inside organizations . He wrote \" Inside an organization , there are only cost centers . The only profit center is a customer whose check has not bounced . \" In addition , William Deming advises managers , in his 9th point , to \" Break down barriers between departments . They must work as a team \" , which means that there have to be teamwork in a company rather than a supplier/customer relationship . One more argument , even the ITIL methodology admits that \" the term \\'colleague \\' may be more accurate in describing how two internal groups are related to one another . \" .

It won a British Science Fiction Association Award in 1994 . The novel is sometimes referred to as Banks \\' second science fiction novel not set within the Culture universe , the first being Against a Dark Background . Setting The book is set on a far future Earth where the uploading of mindstates into a world-spanning computer network ( known as \" Cryptosphere \" , \" the Data Corpus \" , or simply \" Crypt \" ) is commonplace , allowing the dead to be easily reincarnated , a set number of times , first physically and then virtually within the crypt . The crypt has become increasingly chaotic , causing much concern within society . Much of the story takes place within a giant , decaying megastructure known as the \" Fastness \" or \" Serehfa \" built to resemble a medieval castle , in which each \" room \" spans several kilometers horizontally and vertically , and the king \\'s palace occupies one room \\'s chandelier . The structure used to be a space elevator , left behind by the ancestors of those who remained on Earth , with the circuitry of the crypt built into its structure . The world is in crisis as the Solar System is slowly drifting into an interstellar molecular cloud ( \" the Encroachment \" ) , which will eventually dim and then destroy the Sun , ending life on Earth . Plot summary The narrative switches between four main characters . Count Sessine is a high-ranking member of the court who is assassinated , ending his last life . Reborn inside the crypt he comes under repeated attack and is almost permanently killed . On his last virtual life , he makes contact with a copy of himself who assists him . He spends many subjective years wandering the wider reaches of the crypt before being contacted by its representative who requests his aid in relation to the encroachment . Gadfium , the Chief Scientist of the ruling class , is engaged in a conspiracy with like-minded nobles who believe that the elite are not acting in the best interests of the population , and who question the real motive of the ongoing war with the rival clan of Engineers . She learns of a message apparently sent from the fast tower , the highest and previously inaccessible part of the castle , which stresses the danger of the Encroachment and tells of an attempt by the crypt to activate a long forgotten subsystem which may prevent disaster . The message also warns that this will be opposed by those in power as it will threaten their interests . She and her fellow conspirators are considering how to respond when the security forces attempt to arrest them , although Gadfium manages to escape into the depths of the castle . Bascule the Teller is a young man who contacts the dead personalities within the crypt on behalf of their relatives or other interested parties . Whilst searching for a lost friend , he attracts the attention of the Security forces and takes refuge with various chimeric animals whose implants have taken on personalities from within the crypt . He is eventually tasked with ascending the central shaft of the highest tower in a vacuum balloon in order to reach its control room . Asura is a young woman who awakens in a re-incarnation facility with no memory . She is compelled to travel towards the castle , rapidly gathering knowledge about the world before being captured by the security forces . She is interrogated within the crypt , but is able to resist the questioning , becoming stronger at understanding and manipulating her virtual environments . As she escapes her virtual prison , she is physically freed by Gadfium , assisted by the copy of Count Sessine who guided her to Asura \\'s location . Asura broadcasts to the world the truth regarding the encroachment and the attempts of the monarchy to prevent the activation of the crypt sub-systems . She explains her origin , being an emissary of the crypt that was combined with the mind of Count Sessine who sacrificed himself in the process . She was created by the crypt because the relevant systems were kept separate by their designers to prevent infection by chaos . The so-called chaotic elements of the crypt are a burgeoning ecology of Artificial Intelligences . Asura states that both the humans and chaos will have to learn to live with each other . Asura and Gadfium depart , reaching an elevator which is activated for them by Bascule after reaching the control room at the summit of the tower . Asura is able to activate the \" Fearsome Engine \" of the title , which begins the slow process of relocating the solar system out of reach of the cloud . Writing style A quarter of the book is told by Bascule the Teller and is written phonetically in the first person using phonetic transcription and shorthand ( also evinced in the novel \\'s title ) . No dialect words are used , but there are ( inconsistent ) hints of a Scottish and a Cockney accent . Literary significance and criticism Feersum Endjinn was generally well-received , the completeness of the plot and the detailed description of the mega-architecture and the crypt were praised by critics . Literary critic and historian Ian Duncan has argued that Banks \\'s ‘ fearsome engine ’ , like his bridge , “ is another allegory of the state , except that this apparatus is not just sublime in its dissociation from human accountability – it is omniscient , providential , and even organic . ” Kirkus Reviews described it as \" Dazzling stuff : a shame it does n\\'t add up . \" See also Simulated reality References Sources External links Challenging Destiny review Links to reviews of Banks \\' works , including Feersum Endjinn 1994 British novels 1994 science fiction novels Fiction about Earth Fiction about the afterlife Novels by Iain M . Banks Scottish novels', 'The Infancy Gospel of Thomas is a biographical gospel about the childhood of Jesus , believed to date at the latest to the second century . The Infancy Gospel of Thomas was thought to be Gnostic in origin because of references ( by Hippolytus of Rome and Origen of Alexandria ) to a \" Gospel of Thomas \" , but those works are not referencing this Infancy Gospel , as many scholars had thought , but rather to the wholly different Gospel of Thomas . Proto-orthodox Christians regarded the Infancy Gospel of Thomas as inauthentic and heretical . Eusebius rejected it as a heretical \" fiction \" in the third book of his fourth-century Church History , and Pope Gelasius I included it in his list of heretical books in the fifth century . Dating The first known quotation of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas is from Irenaeus of Lyon around AD 180 , who calls it spurious and apocryphal . Scholars generally agree on a date in the mid-to-late-2nd century AD . There are two 2nd-century documents , the Epistula Apostolorum and Irenaeus \\' Adversus haereses , that refers to a story of Jesus \\'s tutor telling him , \" Say alpha , \" and Jesus replied , \" First tell me what is beta , and I can tell you what alpha is . \" At least some period of oral transmission of the source material is generally believed to have occurred , either wholly or as several different stories before it was first transcribed and over time redacted . Thus , both of these documents and the Infancy Gospel of Thomas possibly all refer to the oral versions of this story . The area of origin for the work is unknown and many proposed locations of origin have been put forward . Besides the difficulty in its name , given that the work is not related to the Gospel of Thomas , the work is not a gospel but possibly an appendage to the Gospel of Luke or a stand-alone work that has a dependent association to the canonical Gospel texts . This infancy story ends with Jesus in the temple at age 12 quoting parts of the gospel of Luke . ( see Infancy 19:1–12 and ) . Authorship The author of the gospel is unknown . In the earliest Syriac manuscripts , no author is indicated at all , indicating either a truncated introduction , an author who wished to remain anonymous , or a compilation of existing stories by an editor . In later manuscripts dating from the Middle Ages , the Gospel opens with a prologue where \" Thomas the Israelite \" introduces himself , but with no further explanation . It is possible that this was meant to hint that the author was Judas Thomas , better known as Thomas the Apostle , thought by some Christians to be a brother of Jesus and thus familiar with young Jesus \\'s activities . Manuscript tradition Whether the original language of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas was Greek or Syriac is unknown . The few surviving Greek manuscripts provide no clues themselves because none predates the 13th century , whereas the earliest authorities , according to the editor and translator Montague Rhodes James , are a much abbreviated sixth-century Syriac version , and a Latin palimpsest of the fifth or sixth century , which has never been fully translated and can be found in Vienna . Many manuscripts , translations , shortened versions , alternates , and parallels have slight , nuanced differences . James found that their large number makes the compilation of an urtext very difficult . This number of texts and versions reflects the great popularity of the work during the High Middle Ages . Of the many different versions and alternate forms ( e.g . Greek , Syriac , Latin , Slavonic , etc . ) , the three principal forms are commonly referred to as given by Constantin von Tischendorf . Two of those are Greek texts which are called Greek Text A ( Greek A ) ; Greek Text B ( Greek B ) ; and the third is Latin . The first known publication of the Infancy Gospel of Thomas was by J Fabricius and has come to be known as Greek A . The Greek A is the most well-known form often used and in its full form is the longer of the two Greeks , based on at least 2 manuscripts it consists of nineteen chapters with several alternate other manuscripts with abbreviated forms . The Greek B was found by Tischendorf on a trip to Mount Sinai in 1844 , which is not only shorter ( 11 chapters ) , but is a different version of the well-known A text . It has some chapters abbreviated , other entire chapters left out completely , and few new lines . The Latin translations has two distinct form of versions from the Old Latin with the Late Latin . The Latin was notable as it was the first discovered with an Egyptian prologue . Parts of the Latin version was translated into Old Irish poetry , probably around 700 CE according to James Carney , making this translation one of the earliest of this gospel . Content The text describes the life of the child Jesus from the age of five to age twelve , with fanciful , and sometimes malevolent , supernatural events . He is presented as a precocious child who starts his education early . The stories cover how the young Incarnation of God matures and learns to use his powers for good and how those around him first respond in fear and later with admiration . One of the episodes involves Jesus making clay birds , which he then proceeds to bring to life , an act also attributed to Jesus in , and in a medieval work known as Toledot Yeshu , although Jesus \\'s age at the time of the event is not specified in either account . In another episode , a child disperses water that Jesus has collected . Jesus kills this first child , when at age one he curses a boy , which causes the child \\'s body to wither into a corpse . Later , Jesus kills another child via curse when the child apparently accidentally bumps into Jesus , throws a stone at Jesus , or punches Jesus ( depending on the translation ) . When Joseph and Mary \\'s neighbours complain , they are miraculously struck blind by Jesus . Jesus then starts receiving lessons , but arrogantly tries to teach the teacher , instead , upsetting the teacher who suspects supernatural origins . Jesus is amused by this suspicion , which he confirms , and revokes all his earlier apparent cruelty . Subsequently , he resurrects a friend who is killed when he falls from a roof , and heals another who cuts his foot with an axe . After various other demonstrations of supernatural ability , new teachers try to teach Jesus , but he proceeds to explain the law to them instead . Another set of miracles is mentioned in which Jesus heals his brother , who is bitten by a snake , and two others , who have died from different causes . Finally , the text recounts the episode in Luke in which Jesus , aged 12 , teaches in the temple . Although the miracles seem quite randomly inserted into the text , three miracles are before and three are after each of the sets of lessons . The structure of the story is essentially : Bringing life to a dried fish ( this is only present in later texts ) ( First group ) 3 Miracles - Breathes life into birds fashioned from clay , curses a boy , who then becomes a corpse ( not present in Greek B ) , curses a boy who falls dead and his parents become blind Attempt to teach Jesus which fails , with Jesus doing the teaching 3 Miracles - Reverses his earlier acts ( this would include resurrecting the two boys and healing the blind parents ) , resurrects a friend who fell from a roof , heals a man who chopped his foot with an axe . ( Second group ) Three Miracles - carries water on cloth , produces a feast from a single grain , stretches a beam of wood to help his father finish constructing a bed Attempts to teach Jesus , which fail , with Jesus doing the teaching Three Miracles - heals James from snake poison , resurrects a child who died of illness , resurrects a man who died in a construction accident Incident in the temple paralleling Luke Episodes from Jesus \\'s childhood as depicted in the Klosterneuburger Evangelienwerk , a 14th-century gospel translation : Syriac Infancy Gospel The Syriac Infancy Gospel ( Injilu \\'t Tufuliyyah ) , translated from a Coptic original , gives some parallels to the episodes \" recorded in the book of Josephus the Chief Priest , who was in the time of Christ . \" See also Acts of Thomas List of Gospels Unknown years of Jesus Further reading Barnstone , Willis ( ed . ) .

Bogeymen have no specific appearance and conceptions vary drastically by household and culture , but they are most commonly depicted as masculine or androgynous monsters that punish children for misbehavior . The Bogeyman or conceptually similar monsters can be found in many cultures around the world . Bogeymen may target a specific act or general misbehaviour , depending on what purpose needs serving , often based on a warning from the child \\'s authority figure . The term \" Bogeyman \" is sometimes used as a non-specific personification or metonym for terror , and in some cases , the Devil . Etymology The word bogey originated in the mid-19th century , originally as a quasi-proper name for the devil . It may derive from the Middle English bogge or bugge , meaning a terror or scarecrow . It relates to bugbear , from bug , meaning goblin or scarecrow , and bear , an imaginary demon in the form of a bear that ate small children . It was also used to mean a general object of dread . The word bugaboo , with a similar pair of meanings , may have arisen as an alteration of bugbear . The word is known in Indo-European languages as puck ( English ) , bogle ( Scots ) , púca , pooka or pookha ( Irish ) , pwca , bwga or bwgan ( Welsh ) , bucca ( Cornish ) , buse or busemann ( Norwegian ) , puki ( Old Norse ) , bøhmand or bussemand ( Danish ) , bûzeman ( Western Frisian ) , boeman ( Dutch ) , Butzemann ( German ) , bòcan , bogu ( Slavonic ) , buka or Babay/Babayka ( Russian , бука ) , bauk ( Serbian ) , bubulis ( Latvian ) , baubas ( Lithuanian ) , bobo ( Polish ) , bubák ( Czech ) , bubák ( Slovak ) , bebok ( Silesian ) , papão ( Portuguese ) , babulas ( ) , bua ( Georgian , ბუა ) , babau ( Italian ) , Бабай ( Ukrainian ) , baubau ( Romanian ) , and papu ( Catalan ) . Physical description and personality While the description of the Bogeyman differs on a cultural level , there are often some shared similarities to the creatures . Many of the Bogeymen are depicted as having claws , talons , and sharp teeth . Along with that , the majority of Bogeymen are of the spirit variety , while the minority are demons , witches , and other legendary creatures . Some are even described to have certain animal features such as horns , hooves , and bug like appearances . When looking at the personality traits of the Bogeymen , they are most easily divided into three categories ; the kind that punishes misbehaved children , the kind that are more prone to violence , and the kind that protect the innocent . They all relate in the same way , being that they all exist to teach young children lessons . The large majority of Bogeymen are there to just frighten children with punishments , and not actually inflict much damage . The more vicious Bogeyman is said to steal the children at night , and even eat them . The last category is the Bogeyman who protects people and only punishes those guilty , regardless of age . Other putative origins Because of the myth ’ s worldwide prevalence , it is difficult to find the original source of the legends . The first reference to the Bogeyman would be considered the hobgoblins described in England , in the 16th century . Many believed that they were made to torment humans , and while some only played simple pranks , others were more foul in nature . Analogues in other cultures Bogeyman-like beings are almost universal , common to the folklore of many countries . Sack Man In many countries , a bogeyman variant is portrayed as a man with a sack on his back who carries naughty children away . This is true for many Latin countries , such as Argentina , Uruguay , Chile , Paraguay , Brazil , Portugal , Spain , and the countries of Spanish America , where he is referred to as , , or in Portuguese , ( all of which mean \" the sack/bag man \" ) , or , meaning child-stealer . Similar legends are also very common in Eastern Europe ( e.g . Bulgarian , \" sack man \" ) , as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia . El Coco El Coco ( also and , sometimes called ) is a monster common to many Spanish-speaking countries . The ( or Cucafera ) monster is the equivalent in certain parts of Catalonia . In Spain , parents will sing lullabies or tell rhymes to children , warning them that if they do not sleep , will come to get them . The rhyme originated in the 17th century and has evolved over the years , but still retains its original meaning . Coconuts ( ) received that name because the hairy , brown \" face \" created by the coconut shell \\'s three indentations reminded the Portuguese sailers of \" Coco \" . Latin America also has , although its folklore is usually quite different , commonly mixed with native beliefs , and , because of cultural contacts , sometimes more related to the boogeyman of the United States . However , the term is also used in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries , such as Bolivia , Colombia , Guatemala , Peru , Mexico , El Salvador , Honduras , and Venezuela , although there it is more usually called , as in Puerto Rico , the Dominican Republic , Chile , Uruguay and Argentina . Among Mexican-Americans , is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children \\'s beds at night and kidnaps or eats the child that does not obey his/her parents or go to sleep when it is time to do so . However , the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain : social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed . \" Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence ... and now he \\'s alive , but he \\'s not , \" Medrano said , citing Xavier Garza \\'s 2004 book Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys . \" A Cuca In Brazil folklore , a similar character called Cuca is depicted as a female humanoid alligator , or an old lady with a sack . There is a famous lullaby sung by many parents to their children that says that The Cuca will come to get them and make a soup or soap out of them if they do not sleep , just as in Spain . The Cuca is also a character of Monteiro Lobato \\'s Sítio do Picapau Amarelo ( \" Yellow Woodpecker \\'s Farm \" ) , an acclaimed and creative series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of famous characters from Brazilian folklore . Babau In the countries of central and Eastern Mediterranean , children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as \" babau \" ( or \" baubau \" , \" baobao \" , \" bavbav \" , or \" بعبع ( Bu\\'Bu \\' \" or similar ) . In Italy , the Babau is also called l\\'uomo nero or \" black man \" . In Italy , he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat , with a black hood or hat which hides his face . Sometimes , parents will knock loudly under the table , pretending that someone is knocking at the door , and say something like : \" Here comes l\\'uomo nero ! He must know that there \\'s a child here who does n\\'t want to drink his soup ! \" . It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy : \" Ninna nanna ninna oh , questo bimbo a chi lo do ? Lo darò all \\' uomo nero , che lo tiene un anno intero . \" ( English : \" Lullaby Lulla Oh , who do I give this child to ? I will give him to the Boogeyman , who \\'s going to keep him for a whole year \" ) L\\'uomo nero is not supposed to eat or harm children , but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place . Butzemann Germanic folklore has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman . These have various appearances ( such as of a gnome , man , animal , monster , ghost or devil ) . They are sometimes said to appear at very specific places ( such as in forests , at water bodies , cliffs , cornfields or vineyards ) . These figures are called by many different names which are often only regionally known . One of these , possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman , is the Butzemann , which can be of gnome-like or other demonic or ghostly appearance . Other examples include the Buhmann ( who is mostly proverbial ) and der schwarze Mann ( \" The Black Man \" ) , an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away . The figure is part of the children \\'s game Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann ? \" ( \" Who is afraid of the bogeyman ? \" ) . Other examples Afghanistan – The Madar-i-Al is a nocturnal hag that slaughters infants in their cribs and is invoked to frighten children into obedience . Burning wild rue seeds and fumigating the area around the baby will offer protection against her . Albania : The Buba is a serpentine monster . Mothers would tell their children to be quiet or the Buba would get them . The Gogol is a terrible giant that frightens children into being good . The Lubia is a female demon with an insatiable appetite for the flesh of children , especially girls . She has many heads , from seven to a hundred , and like the Greek hydra if one head is severed then others will grow in its place . Azerbaijan – The Div is a hairy giant that eats children . It was outsmarted and defeated by a clever young boy named Jirtdan , a popular hero in Azerbaijani fairy tales . Belize – Tata Duende is a mythical goblin described as being of small stature , with a beard , wrinkles , backwards feet , a large brimmed hat , and lacking thumbs . It is a protector of the forests and animals and was used to scare children from going out to play at night or going into the jungle . Bosnia and Herzegovina , Croatia , Serbia and North Macedonia – Babaroga ( a South Slavic variant of Baba Yaga ; baba meaning hag and rog meaning horn , thus literally meaning horned hag ) is commonly attributed the characteristics of the bogeyman . The details vary regionally and by household due to oral tradition , but it always manifests as a menacing hag who hunts irreverent children . It is described as fond of trapping and eating caught children . Brazil and Portugal – A monster more akin to the Bogeyman is called Bicho Papão ( \" Eating Beast \" ) or Sarronco ( \" Deep-Voiced Man \" ) . A notable difference between it and the homem do saco is that the latter is a daytime menace and \" Bicho Papão \" is a nighttime menace . Another important difference is that \" Homem do Saco \" ( \" Sack Man \" ) usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization , while \" Bicho Papão \" scares naughty children and hides under their beds , closets or roofs . In Inuit mythology , there is a shapeshifting creature called the Ijiraq , that kidnaps children , to hide them away and abandon them . If the children can convince the Ijiraq to let them go , they can use inukshuk of stone to find their way home . Also from Inuit Mythology there is the Qalupalik , which are human-like creatures with long fingernails , green skin , and long hair that live in the sea . They carry babies and children away in their Amauti , if they disobey their parents and wander off alone . The Qalupalik adopt the children and bring them to live with them underwater . Canada – In Quebec and French Canada the Bogeyman is called \\'The Seven o\\'Clock Man \\' . Children are warned to go to bed by 7 o\\'clock ( 7 heure ) , lest Mister Seven O\\'Clock will come to catch them . Cyprus – In the Cypriot dialect , the Bogeyman is called Kkullas ( Κκουλλάς ) ; a man ( vaguely described as hooded and/or deformed ) who will put misbehaving children in a bag and take them away from their homes . Czech Republic – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in the Czech Republic is bubák ( ≈ imp ) or strašidlo ( ≈ ghost ) , but these are not typically connected with abducting children nor with discriminating between well and bad behaved ones . This is more often attributed to polednice and klekánice ( Lady midday , or Lady evening ) , or to the čert ( Krampus , or lit . devil ) who , along with st . Nicholas and angel , traditionally visits families on December 5 . Egypt – The \" Abu Rigl Maslukha \" ( ابو رجل مسلوخة ) , which translates to the \" Man With Burnt/Skinned Leg \" . It is a very scary story that parents tell their children when they misbehave . The \" Abu Rigl Maslukha \" is a monster that got burnt when he was a child because he did not listen to his parents .

Dilbert Bogeyman – Dilbert strip of November 18 , 2011 American legendary creatures English legendary creatures European folklore characters Legendary creatures in popular culture Supernatural legends Mythological monsters Devils', 'The Woman Who Did ( 1895 ) is a novel by Grant Allen about a young , self-assured middle-class woman who defies convention as a matter of principle and who is fully prepared to suffer the consequences of her actions . It was first published in London by John Lane in a series intended to promote the ideal of the \" New Woman \" . It was adapted into a British silent film in 1915 , The Woman Who Did , which was directed by Walter West , and later into a 1925 German film , Die Frau mit dem schlechten Ruf . Plot summary Herminia Barton , the Cambridge-educated daughter of a clergyman , frees herself from her parents \\' influence , moves to London and starts living alone . As she is not a woman of independent means , she starts working as a teacher . When she meets and falls in love with Alan Merrick , a lawyer , she suggests they live together without getting married . Reluctantly , he agrees , and the couple move to Italy . There , in Florence , Merrick dies of typhoid before their daughter Dolores is born . Legal technicalities and the fact that the couple were not married prevent Herminia from inheriting any of Merrick \\'s money . Dreaming of being a role model for Dolores and her friends , Herminia returns to England and raises her daughter as a single mother . She wants to show the younger generation that even as a woman there is something one can do about the unfair position of women in society—a small step maybe , but with more and larger steps to follow soon . However , Dolores turns out to be ashamed of her mother \\'s unmarried state and gradually turns against her . Eventually , Herminia chooses to make a huge sacrifice for her daughter \\'s benefit and commits suicide . Reception Allen was sympathetic to the feminist cause and saw his novel as a way to promote women \\'s rights . It certainly created an immediate popular sensation - Flora Thompson for instance describing how , in small-town Hampshire , \" copies were bought and handed round until practically everyone of mature age in the village had read and passed judgement on it \" . However , the novel was also controversial right from the start , with conservative readers as well as feminists criticizing Allen for the heroine he had invented . For example , Victoria Crosse wrote her novel The Woman Who Did n\\'t ( 1895 ) as a response to Allen \\'s book and Mrs . Lovett Cameron wrote The Man Who Did n\\'t . Whereas Herminia Barton questions the institution of marriage by refusing to get married herself , Victoria Crosse \\'s heroine Eurydice Williamson— \" the woman who did n\\'t \" —remains faithful to her impossible husband although , during a passage from India , she meets a man who falls in love with her . Similarly , Lovett Cameron \\'s hero is a married man who resists the temptation to stray . Another novel written in reply to Allen \\'s work , Lucas Cleeve \\'s The Woman Who Would n\\'t , ( 1895 ) sold well and received hostile reviews . The author said of this : \" If one young girl is kept from a loveless , mistaken marriage , if one frivolous nature is checked in her career of flirtation by remembrance of Lady Morris , I shall perhaps be forgiven by the public for raising my feeble voice in answer to The Woman Who Did \" . The campaigner Emma Brooke saw this novel and her own novel \" The Superfluous Woman \" as important in trying to resolve the \" Sex Question \" which she thought dominated intellectual debate in the 1880s . She was annoyed when H . G . Wells reinvented the question when he spoke to the Fabian Society in 1906 . Sarah Grand , the feminist writer who coined the term \" New Woman , \" considered the novel to have and important social purity moral : Mr . Grant Allen is a large-minded , liberal man , and he argues that if men are permitted to practice polygamy then women should be equally free to indulge in polyandry . I do not know that he approves of polygamy , only he is liberal enough to say that if men are to claim sexual freedom then it should be accorded to women also . The story answers the question when followed to its logical conclusions , and shows very clearly that women have nothing to gain and everything to lose by renouncing the protection which legal marriage gives.Thomas Hardy approved more of Allen \\'s progressive aims in the novel , than of their artistic realisation .

Notes and references External links Populated places on Lake Geneva Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Vaud\", 'Forgiveness , in a psychological sense , is the intentional and voluntary process by which one who may initially feel victimized , undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding a given offense , and overcomes negative emotions such as resentment and vengeance ( however justified it might be ) . Theorists differ , however , in the extent to which they believe forgiveness also implies replacing the negative emotions with positive attitudes ( i.e . an increased ability to wish the offender well ) . In certain legal contexts , forgiveness is a term for absolving or giving up all claims on account of debt , loan , obligation , or other claims . On the psychological level , forgiveness is different from simple condoning ( viewing an action as harmful , yet to be “ forgiven ” or overlooked for certain reasons of “ charity ” ) , excusing or pardoning ( merely releasing the offender from responsibility for an action ) , or forgetting ( attempting to somehow remove from one \\'s conscious mind , the memory of a given “ offense \" ) . In some schools of thought , it involves a personal and \" voluntary \" effort at the self-transformation of one \\'s own half of a relationship with another , such that one \\'s own self is restored to peace and ideally to what psychologist Carl Rogers has referred to as “ unconditional positive regard ” towards the other . As a psychological concept and virtue , the benefits of forgiveness have been explored in religious thought , social sciences and medicine . Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the person who forgives including forgiving themselves , in terms of the person forgiven or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven . In most contexts , forgiveness is granted without any expectation of restorative justice , and without any response on the part of the offender ( for example , one may forgive a person who is incommunicado or dead ) . In practical terms , it may be necessary for the offender to offer some form of acknowledgment , an apology , or even just ask for forgiveness , in order for the wronged person to believe themselves able to forgive as well . Social and political dimensions of forgiveness involves the strictly private and religious sphere of \" forgiveness \" . The notion of \" forgiveness \" is generally considered unusual in the political field . However , Hannah Arendt considers that the \" faculty of forgiveness \" has its place in public affairs . The philosopher believes that forgiveness can liberate resources both individually and collectively in the face of the irreparable . During an investigation in Rwanda on the discourses and practices of forgiveness after the 1994 genocide , sociologist Benoit Guillou illustrated the extreme polysemy ( multiple meanings ) of the word \" forgiveness \" but also the eminently political character of the notion . By way of conclusion of his work , the author proposes four main figures of forgiveness to better understanding , on the one hand , ambiguous uses and , on the other hand , the conditions under which forgiveness can mediate a resumption of social link . Most world religions include teachings on the nature of forgiveness , and many of these teachings provide an underlying basis for many varying modern day traditions and practices of forgiveness . Some religious doctrines or philosophies place greater emphasis on the need for humans to find some sort of divine forgiveness for their own shortcomings , others place greater emphasis on the need for humans to practice forgiveness of one another , yet others make little or no distinction between human and divine forgiveness . The term forgiveness can be used interchangeably and is interpreted many different ways by people and cultures . This is specifically important in relational communication because forgiveness is a key component in communication and the overall progression as an individual and couple or group . When all parties have a mutual viewing for forgiveness then a relationship can be maintained . \" Understanding antecedents of forgiveness , exploring the physiology of forgiveness , and training people to become more forgiving all imply that we have a shared meaning for the term \" . Research Although there is presently no consensus for a psychological definition of forgiveness in research literature , agreement has emerged that forgiveness is a process , and a number of models describing the process of forgiveness have been published , including one from a radical behavioral perspective . Dr . Robert Enright from the University of Wisconsin–Madison founded the International Forgiveness Institute and is considered the initiator of forgiveness studies . He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness . Recent work has focused on what kind of person is more likely to be forgiving . A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more neurotic , angry , and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed . Specifically , these people were more likely to still avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression . Studies show that people who forgive are happier and healthier than those who hold resentments . The first study to look at how forgiveness improves physical health discovered that when people think about forgiving an offender it leads to improved functioning in their cardiovascular and nervous systems . Another study at the University of Wisconsin found the more forgiving people were , the less they suffered from a wide range of illnesses . The less forgiving people reported a greater number of health problems . The research of Dr . Fred Luskin of Stanford University , and author of the book Forgive for Good presented evidence that forgiveness can be learned ( i.e . can be a teachable skill , with practice ) based on research projects into the effects of teaching forgiveness : giving empirical validity to the concept that forgiveness is powerful as well as excellent for your health . In three separate studies , including one with Catholics and Protestants from Northern Ireland whose family members were murdered in the political violence , he found that people who are taught how to forgive become less angry , feel less hurt , are more optimistic , become more forgiving in a variety of situations , and become more compassionate and self-confident . His studies show a reduction in experience of stress , physical manifestations of stress , and an increase in vitality . Ideas about what forgiveness is not Forgiveness is not condoning Forgiveness is not forgetting Forgiveness is not excusing ( i.e . making reasons to explain away offender \\'s responsibility or free will ) Forgiveness does n\\'t have to be religious or otherworldly Forgiveness is not minimizing your hurt Forgiveness is not reconciliation ( i.e . reestablishing trust in the relationship ) Forgiveness is not denying or suppressing anger ; rather its focus is on resentment.—in particular , in order to forgive it is healthy to acknowledge and express negative emotions , before you can even forgive Forgiveness is not ignoring accountability or justice—in particular , punishment and recompensation are independent of the choice to forgive ( you can forgive , or not forgive , and still pursue punishment and/or recompensation , regardless ) Forgiveness is not pardoning ; it can not be granted or chosen by someone else Emotional forgiveness is not the same as decisional forgiveness or the expression of forgiveness . Expressing emotions ( i.e. , \" I am angry at you \" or \" I forgive you \" ) is not the same as genuinely having or experiencing the emotions ( i.e. , people can deny , mistake , or lie about their emotional experience to another person while genuinely feeling something else instead ) Although heavily debated , emotional forgiveness is for you , not the offender ( i.e. , unless you choose to make it so : by expressing it , or by trying to reconcile ) The timeliness of forgiveness The psychologist Wanda Malcolm writes a chapter in Women \\'s Reflections on the Complexities of Forgiveness titled \" the Timeliness of Forgiveness Interventions \" where she outlines reasons why forgiveness takes time : when work on self ( care/healing ) takes priority ( i.e . therapy , medical injuries , etc . ) , when issues of relational safety need to be addressed , and where facilitating forgiveness may be premature immediately after an interpersonal offense . Malcolm explains that \" premature efforts to facilitate forgiveness may be a sign of our reluctance to witness our client ’ s pain and suffering and may unwittingly reinforce the client ’ s belief that the pain and suffering is too much to bear and must be suppressed or avoided . \" Worthington ( et al . ) observed that “ anything done to promote forgiveness has little impact unless substantial time is spent at helping participants think through and emotionally experience their forgiveness ” . Efforts to facilitate forgiveness may be premature immediately after an interpersonal injury , if not harmful . Indeed , if you make forgiveness a goal , it remains elusive , like a carrot on a stick ; just when you think you \\'ve got it , it \\'s out of reach again . But when you focus on self-compassion and develop your core-values , forgiveness sneaks up on you . If you realize that you \\'ve forgiven your betrayer , it will be after the fact ( of detachment or full emotional reinvestment ) , not before . Religious views Religion can have an impact on how someone chooses to forgive and the process they go through . Most have conceptualized religion \\'s effect in three ways—through religious activity , religious affiliation and teachings , and imitation . There are several thousand religions in the world and each one can look at forgiveness a different way . Abrahamic Judaism In Judaism , if a person causes harm , but then sincerely and honestly apologizes to the wronged individual and tries to rectify the wrong , the wronged individual is encouraged , but not required , to grant forgiveness : \" It is forbidden to be obdurate and not allow yourself to be appeased . On the contrary , one should be easily pacified and find it difficult to become angry . When asked by an offender for forgiveness , one should forgive with a sincere mind and a willing spirit ... forgiveness is natural to the seed of Israel . \" ( Mishneh Torah , Teshuvah 2:10 ) In Judaism , one must go \" to those he has harmed \" in order to be entitled to forgiveness . [ One who sincerely apologizes three times for a wrong committed against another has fulfilled their obligation to seek forgiveness . ( Shulchan Aruch ) OC 606:1 ] This means that in Judaism a person can not obtain forgiveness from God for wrongs the person has done to other people . This also means that , unless the victim forgave the perpetrator before he died , murder is unforgivable in Judaism , and they will answer to God for it , though the victims \\' family and friends can forgive the murderer for the grief they caused them . The Tefila Zaka meditation , which is recited just before Yom Kippur , closes with the following : \" I know that there is no one so righteous that they have not wronged another , financially or physically , through deed or speech . This pains my heart within me , because wrongs between humans and their fellow are not atoned by Yom Kippur , until the wronged one is appeased . Because of this , my heart breaks within me , and my bones tremble ; for even the day of death does not atone for such sins . Therefore I prostrate and beg before You , to have mercy on me , and grant me grace , compassion , and mercy in Your eyes and in the eyes of all people . For behold , I forgive with a final and resolved forgiveness anyone who has wronged me , whether in person or property , even if they slandered me , or spread falsehoods against me . So I release anyone who has injured me either in person or in property , or has committed any manner of sin that one may commit against another [ except for legally enforceable business obligations , and except for someone who has deliberately harmed me with the thought ‘ I can harm him because he will forgive me \\' ] . Except for these two , I fully and finally forgive everyone ; may no one be punished because of me . And just as I forgive everyone , so may You grant me grace in the eyes of others , that they too forgive me absolutely . \" Thus the \" reward \" for forgiving others is not God \\'s forgiveness for wrongs done to others , but rather help in obtaining forgiveness from the other person . Sir Jonathan Sacks , chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonwealth , summarized : \" it is not that God forgives , while human beings do not . To the contrary , we believe that just as only God can forgive sins against God , so only human beings can forgive sins against human beings . \" Jews observe a Day of Atonement Yom Kippur on the day before God makes decisions regarding what will happen during the coming year . Just prior to Yom Kippur , Jews will ask forgiveness of those they have wronged during the prior year ( if they have not already done so ) . During Yom Kippur itself , Jews fast and pray for God \\'s forgiveness for the transgressions they have made against God in the prior year . Sincere repentance is required , and once again , God can only forgive one for the sins one has committed against God ; this is why it is necessary for Jews also to seek the forgiveness of those people who they have wronged . Christianity Forgiveness is central to Christian ethics and is a frequent topic in sermons and theological works , because Christianity is about Christ , Christ is about redemption , and redemption is about forgiveness of sin . God \\'s forgiveness Unlike in Judaism , God can forgive sins committed by people against people , since he can forgive every sin except for the eternal sin , and forgiveness from one \\'s victim is not necessary for salvation . The Parable of the Prodigal Son is perhaps the best known parable about forgiveness and refers to God \\'s forgiveness for those who repent . Jesus asked for God \\'s forgiveness of those who crucified him . \" And Jesus said , \\'Father , forgive them , for they know not what they do . \\' \" – Luke 23:34 Forgiving others Forgiving offenses is among the spiritual works of mercy , and forgiving others begets being forgiven by God . Considering Mark 11:25 , and Matthew 6:14–15 , that follows the Lord \\'s Prayer , \" For if you forgive men when they sin against you , your heavenly Father will also forgive you . But if you do not forgive men their sins , your Father will not forgive your sins , \" forgiveness is not an option to a Christian , rather one must forgive to be a Christian . Forgiveness in Christianity is a manifestation of submission to Christ and fellow believers . In the New Testament , Jesus speaks of the importance of forgiving or showing mercy toward others . This is based on the belief that God forgives sins through faith in the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ in his death ( 1 John 2:2 ) and that , therefore , Christians should forgive others ( Ephesians 4:32 ) . Jesus used the parable of the unmerciful servant ( Matthew 18:21–35 ) to show that His followers ( represented in the parable by the servant ) should forgive because God ( represented by the king ) forgives much more . In the Sermon on the Mount , Jesus repeatedly spoke of forgiveness : \" Blessed are the merciful , for they will be shown mercy . \" Matthew 5:7 ( NIV ) \" Therefore , if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you , leave your gift there in front of the altar . First go and be reconciled to your brother ; then come and offer your gift . \" Matthew 5:23–24 ( NIV ) \" And when you stand praying , if you hold anything against anyone , forgive him , so that your Father in heaven may forgive you your sins . \" Mark 11:25 ( NIV ) \" But I tell you who hear me : Love your enemies , do good to those who hate you , bless those who curse you , pray for those who mistreat you . If someone strikes you on one cheek , turn to him the other also . \" Luke 6:27–29 ( NIV ) \" Be merciful , just as your Father is merciful . \" Luke 6:36 ( NIV ) \" Do not judge , and you will not be judged . Do not condemn , and you will not be condemned . Forgive , and you will be forgiven . \" Luke 6:37 ( NIV ) Elsewhere , it is said \" Then Peter came to Him and said , \" Lord , how often shall my brother sin against me , and I forgive him ? Up to seven times ? \" Jesus said to him , \" I do not say to you , up to seven times , but up to seventy times seven . \" Matthew 18:21–22 ( NKJV ) Benedict XVI , on a visit to Lebanon in 2012 , insisted that peace must be based on mutual forgiveness : \" Only forgiveness , given and received , can lay lasting foundations for reconciliation and universal peace \" . Pope Francis during a General Audience explained forgiving others as God forgives oneself . Islam Islam teaches that Allah is Al-Ghaffur \" The Oft-Forgiving \" , and is the original source of all forgiveness ( ghufran ) . Seeking forgiveness from Allah with repentance is a virtue . Islam recommends forgiveness , because Allah values forgiveness . There are numerous verses in Quran and the Hadiths recommending forgiveness . However , Islam also allows revenge to the extent harm done , but forgiveness is encouraged , with a promise of reward from Allah . Afw ( عفو is another term for forgiveness in Islam ; it occurs 35 times in Quran , and in some Islamic theological studies , it is used interchangeably with ghufran . Afw means to pardon , to excuse for a fault or an offense . According to Muhammad Amanullah , forgiveness ( \\'Afw ) in Islam is derived from three wisdoms . First and the most important wisdom of forgiveness is that it is merciful when the victim or guardian of the victim accepts money instead of revenge . The second wisdom of forgiveness is that it increases honor and prestige of the one who forgives . Forgiveness is not a sign of weakness , humiliation or dishonor . Forgiveness is honor , raises the merit of the forgiver in the eyes of Allah , and enables a forgiver to enter paradise . The third wisdom of forgiveness is that according to some scholars , such as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi , forgiveness expiates ( kaffarah ) the forgiver from the sins they may have committed at other occasions in life . Forgiveness is a form of charity ( sadaqat ) . Forgiveness comes from taqwa ( piety ) , a quality of God-fearing people . Bahá \\' í Faith In the Bahá \\' í Writings , this explanation is given of how to be forgiving individuals toward others : \" Love the creatures for the sake of God and not for themselves . You will never become angry or impatient if you love them for the sake of God . Humanity is not perfect . There are imperfections in every human being , and you will always become unhappy if you look toward the people themselves . But if you look toward God , you will love them and be kind to them , for the world of God is the world of perfection and complete mercy . Therefore , do not look at the shortcomings of anybody ; see with the sight of forgiveness . \" — ` Abdu \\' l-Bahá , The Promulgation of Universal Peace , p . 92 Asian Buddhism In Buddhism , forgiveness is seen as a practice to prevent harmful thoughts from causing havoc on one \\'s mental well-being . Buddhism recognizes that feelings of hatred and ill-will leave a lasting effect on our mind karma . Instead , Buddhism encourages the cultivation of thoughts that leave a wholesome effect . \" In contemplating the law of karma , we realize that it is not a matter of seeking revenge but of practicing mettā and forgiveness , for the victimizer is , truly , the most unfortunate of all . \" When resentments have already arisen , the Buddhist view is to calmly proceed to release them by going back to their roots . Buddhism centers on release from delusion and suffering through meditation and receiving insight into the nature of reality . Buddhism questions the reality of the passions that make forgiveness necessary as well as the reality of the objects of those passions . \" If we haven ’ t forgiven , we keep creating an identity around our pain , and that is what is reborn . That is what suffers . \" Buddhism places much emphasis on the concepts of Mettā ( loving kindness ) , karuna ( compassion ) , mudita ( sympathetic joy ) , and upekkhā ( equanimity ) , as a means to avoiding resentments in the first place . These reflections are used to understand the context of suffering in the world , both our own and the suffering of others . \" He abused me , he struck me , he overcame me , he robbed me ’ — in those who harbor such thoughts hatred will never cease . \" \" He abused me , he struck me , he overcame me , he robbed me ’ — in those who do not harbor such thoughts hatred will cease . \" ( Dhammapada 1.3–4 ; trans . Radhakrishnan – see article ) Hindu Dharma In Vedic literature and epics of Hinduism , Ksama or Kshyama ( Sanskrit : क्षमा ) and fusion words based on it , describe the concept of forgiveness . The word ksama is often combined with kripa ( tenderness ) , daya ( kindness ) and karuna ( करुणा , compassion ) in Sanskrit texts . In Rg Veda , forgiveness is discussed in verses dedicated to deity Varuna , both the context of the one who has done wrong and one who is wronged . Forgiveness is considered one of the six cardinal virtues in Hindu Dharma . The theological basis for forgiveness in Hindu Dharma is that a person who does not forgive carries a baggage of memories of the wrong , of negative feelings , of anger and unresolved emotions that affect their present as well as future . In Hindu Dharma , not only should one forgive others , but one must also seek forgiveness if one has wronged someone else . Forgiveness is to be sought from the individual wronged , as well as society at large , by acts of charity , purification , fasting , rituals and meditative introspection . The concept of forgiveness is further refined in Hindu Dharma by rhetorically contrasting it in feminine and masculine form . In feminine form , one form of forgiveness is explained through Lakshmi ( called Goddess Sri in some parts of India ) ; the other form is explained in the masculine form through her husband Vishnu . Feminine Lakshmi forgives even when the one who does wrong does not repent . Masculine Vishnu , on the other hand , forgives only when the wrongdoer repents . In Hindu Dharma , the feminine forgiveness granted without repentance by Lakshmi is higher and more noble than the masculine forgiveness granted only after there is repentance . In the Hindu epic Ramayana , Sita – the wife of King Rama – is symbolically eulogized for forgiving a crow even as it harms her . Later in the epic Ramayana , she is eulogized again for forgiving those who harass her while she has been kidnapped in Lanka . Many other Hindu stories discuss forgiveness with or without repentance . The concept of forgiveness is treated in extensive debates of Hindu literature . In some Hindu texts , certain sins and intentional acts are debated as naturally unforgivable ; for example , murder and rape ; these ancient scholars argue whether blanket forgiveness is morally justifiable in every circumstance , and whether forgiveness encourages crime , disrespect , social disorder and people not taking you seriously . Other ancient Hindu texts highlight that forgiveness is not same as reconciliation . Forgiveness in Hindu Dharma does not necessarily require that one reconcile with the offender , nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations . Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate , tender , kind and letting go of the harm or hurt caused by someone or something else . Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts , and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life ( dharmic life ) . In the highest self-realized state , forgiveness becomes the essence of one \\'s personality , where the persecuted person remains unaffected , without agitation , without feeling like a victim , free from anger ( akrodhi ) . Other epics and ancient literature of Hindu Dharma discuss forgiveness . For example : Jainism In Jainism , forgiveness is one of the main virtues that needs to be cultivated by the Jains . Kṣamāpanā or supreme forgiveness forms part of one of the ten characteristics of dharma . In the Jain prayer , ( pratikramana ) Jains repeatedly seek forgiveness from various creatures—even from ekindriyas or single sensed beings like plants and microorganisms that they may have harmed while eating and doing routine activities . Forgiveness is asked by uttering the phrase , Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ . Micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ is a Prakrit language phrase literally meaning \" may all the evil that has been done be fruitless . \" During samvatsari—the last day of Jain festival paryusana—Jains utter the phrase Micchami Dukkadam after pratikraman . As a matter of ritual , they personally greet their friends and relatives micchāmi dukkaḍaṃ seeking their forgiveness . No private quarrel or dispute may be carried beyond samvatsari , and letters and telephone calls are made to the outstation friends and relatives asking their forgiveness . Pratikraman also contains the following prayer : Khāmemi savva-jīve savvë jive khamantu me / metti me savva-bhūesu , veraṃ mejjha na keṇavi // ( I ask pardon of all creatures , may all creatures pardon me . May I have friendship with all beings and enmity with none . ) In their daily prayers and samayika , Jains recite Iryavahi sutra seeking forgiveness from all creatures while involved in routine activities : May you , O Revered One ! Voluntarily permit me . I would like to confess my sinful acts committed while walking . I honour your permission . I desire to absolve myself of the sinful acts by confessing them . I seek forgiveness from all those living beings which I may have tortured while walking , coming and going , treading on living organism , seeds , green grass , dew drops , ant hills , moss , live water , live earth , spider web and others . I seek forgiveness from all these living beings , be they — one sensed , two sensed , three sensed , four sensed or five sensed . Which I may have kicked , covered with dust , rubbed with ground , collided with other , turned upside down , tormented , frightened , shifted from one place to another or killed and deprived them of their lives . ( By confessing ) may I be absolved of all these sins . Jain texts quote Māhavīra on forgiveness : By practicing prāyaṣcitta ( repentance ) , a soul gets rid of sins , and commits no transgressions ; he who correctly practises prāyaṣcitta gains the road and the reward of the road , he wins the reward of good conduct . By begging forgiveness he obtains happiness of mind ; thereby he acquires a kind disposition towards all kinds of living beings ; by this kind disposition he obtains purity of character and freedom from fear . — Māhavīra in Uttarādhyayana Sūtra 29:17–18 Even the code of conduct amongst the monks requires the monks to ask forgiveness for all transgressions : If among monks or nuns occurs a quarrel or dispute or dissension , the young monk should ask forgiveness of the superior , and the superior of the young monk . They should forgive and ask forgiveness , appease and be appeased , and converse without restraint . For him who is appeased , there will be success ( in control ) ; for him who is not appeased , there will be no success ; therefore one should appease one \\'s self . \\'Why has this been said , Sir ? Peace is the essence of monasticism \\' . — Kalpa Sūtra 8:59 Other Hoʻoponopono Hoʻoponopono is an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness , combined with prayer . Similar forgiveness practices were performed on islands throughout the South Pacific , including Samoa , Tahiti and New Zealand . Traditionally Hoʻoponopono is practiced by healing priests or kahuna lapaʻau among family members of a person who is physically ill . Modern versions are performed within the family by a family elder , or by the individual alone . Popular recognition The need to forgive is widely recognized by the public , but they are often at a loss for ways to accomplish it . For example , in a large representative sampling of American people on various religious topics in 1988 , the Gallup Organization found that 94 % said it was important to forgive , but 85 % said they needed some outside help to be able to forgive . However , not even regular prayer was found to be effective . Akin to forgiveness is mercy , so even if a person is not able to complete the forgiveness process they can still show mercy , especially when so many wrongs are done out of weakness rather than malice . The Gallup poll revealed that the only thing that was effective was \" meditative prayer \" . Forgiveness as a tool has been extensively used in restorative justice programs , after the abolition of apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( South Africa ) , run for victims and perpetrators of Rwandan genocide , the violence in Israeli–Palestinian conflict , and Northern Ireland conflict , which has also been documented in film , Beyond Right and Wrong : Stories of Justice and Forgiveness ( 2012 ) . Forgiveness theory can be found and applied to religion , relationships , health , individual , interventions , and much more . Forgiveness is an important trait to understand and possess because it is something that everyone has to experience in their both personal and professional life . Forgiveness is associated with the theory of emotion because it is largely drawn from a person \\'s emotional connection and level with the situation . Forgiveness is something that most people are taught to understand and practice at a young age . Because forgiveness is an emotion there is not an exact originator of it but there are several theorists , psychologists , and sociologists who link it to other theories or apply theories to help understand the concept . The philosopher Joseph Butler ( Fifteen Sermons ) defined forgiveness as \" overcoming of resentment , the overcoming of moral hatred , as a speech act , and as forbearance \" . Forgiveness in relationships Forgiveness in marriage is an important aspect in a marriage . When two individuals are able to forgive each other it results in a long happy marriage . Forgiveness can help prevent problems from accruing in the married couple \\'s future . In a 2005 study , researchers were interested in figuring out whether forgiveness is important in a marriage . When does forgiveness usually accrue ? Does it accrue before an argument or after an argument ? Does forgiveness take a role when a person breaks a promise ? etc . Researcher found six components that were related to forgiveness in marriage and explains how each one relates to forgiveness . The six components are : satisfaction , ambivalence , conflict , attributions , empathy and commitment . Researchers provided an overview of forgiveness in marriage and how individuals in a relationship believe that if forgiveness accrues then you must forget what had happened . Moreover , based on the interventions and recommendations the researchers started to see how important forgiveness is in a relationship and how it can lead to a happy and healthy relationship . In a 2005 study , researchers mentioned that when couples forgive their spouses they sometimes need help from professionals to overcome their pain that might be left behind . Researchers also described the difference between how each individual perceives the situation based on who is in pain and who caused the pain . Also how the couple react to the situation based on their feelings and how they personally respond to the situation . The act and effects of forgiveness can vary depending on the relationship status between persons . Whether you are married , friends , or even just acquaintances , the process of forgiving is similar but not completely the same . When it comes to forgiving a friend , the friend \\'s personal situation and feelings must also be considered . You must ask yourself if you were in the wrong or if the other person could already be going through some type of grief or suffering at the time of the incident . Consideration of other people \\'s feelings plays a factor as to how much and how quickly a situation can be resolved . The model of forgiveness : \" Enright \\'s model of forgiveness has received empirical support and sees forgiveness as a journey through four phases \" which are : Uncovering phase : Emphases on exploring the pain that the individual has experienced . Decision phase : The nature of forgiveness is discussed . Also the individual commits that they will try to forgive the spouse Work phase : The focus shifts to the transgressor in an effort to gain insight and understanding . Deepening phase \\' : The victim moves toward resolution , becoming aware that he/she is not alone , having been the recipient of others \\' forgiveness , and finds meaning and purpose in the forgiveness process . Furthermore , when married couples argue they tend to focus on who is right and who is wrong . Also couples tend to focus on who proves the other wrong which can cause more problems and can make the problem worse because it will make it harder to forgive one another . Recommendation and interventions : The researchers also came up with recommendation for practitioners and intervention to help individuals that are married on how to communicate with each other , how to resolve problems and how to make it easier to forgive each other . Some of the interventions of forgiveness in marriage has been a great success . It encouraged forgiveness and made couples happier together . Some of the recommendations that was given to practitioners was that the individuals had to explore and understand what forgiveness means before starting any intervention because the preconceived idea of forgiveness can cause problems with couples being open to forgive . For example , an individual not forgiving their spouse out of fear that the spouse might think that they are weak which can cause a conflict . It was stated that the couple must know the following : Forgiveness takes The different forms of forgiveness The danger in communicating in forgiveness That Perpetrators and victims have different perceptive context is important Furthermore , the researchers thought of ways to further help married couples in the future and suggested that they should explore the following : The importance of seeking forgiveness Self-forgiveness The role of the sacred in marital forgiveness Relationships are at the sentiment aspect of our lives ; with our families at home and friends outside . Relationships interact in schools and universities , with work mates and , with colleagues at the workplace and in our diverse communities . In the article it states , the quality of these relationships determines our individual well-being , how well we learn , develop and function , our sense of connectedness with others and the health so society . In 2002 , two innovators of Positive Psychology , Ed Diener and Martin Seligman , conducted a study at the University of Illinois on the 10 % of students with the highest scores recorded on a survey of personal happiness . What they came up with was most salient characteristics shared by students who were very content and showed positive life styles were the ones who \" their strong ties to friends and family and commitment to spending time with them . \" A study done in 2000 , identified as a key study that taken part and examined two natures of relationships ( friends and family ) and at what age does the support switch importance from one to the other . The study showed that people whom had good family relationship were able to have more positive outside relationships with friends . Through the family relationship and friendships , the character of the individual was built to forgive and learn from the experience in the family . In 2001 , Charlotte vanOyen Witvliet asked people to think about someone who had hurt , wronged , or offended them . As they thought to answer , she observed their reaction . She observed their blood pressure , heart rate , facial muscle tension , and sweat gland activity . To deliberate on an old misdemeanor is to practice unforgiveness . The outcome to the recall of the grudge the candidates ’ blood pressure and heart rate increased , and they sweated more . Pondering about their resents was stressful , and subjects found the rumination unpleasant . When they adept forgiveness , their physical stimulation glided downward . They showed no more of an anxiety reaction than normal wakefulness produces . In 2013 , study on self-forgiveness with spouse forgiveness has a better outcome to a healthier life by Pelucchi , Paleari , Regalia and Fincham . This study investigates self-forgiveness for real hurts committed against the partner in a romantic relationship ( 168 couples ) . For both males and females , the mistaken partners were more content with their romantic relationship to the extent that they had more positive and less negative sentiment and thoughts toward themselves . In the study when looking at the victimized partners were more gratified with the relationship when the offending partner had less negative sentiment and thoughts towards themselves . It concludes that self-forgiveness when in a relationship has positive impact on both the offending and victimized partner . Forgiveness interventions Both negative and positive affect play a role in forgiveness interventions . It is the general consensus across researchers in the field of psychology , that the overarching purpose of forgiveness interventions is to decrease overall negative affect associated with the stimulus and increase the individual \\'s positive affect . The disease model has been mainly used in regards to therapy , however the incorporation of forgiveness into therapy has been lacking , and has been slowly gaining popularity in the last couple of decades . More recent research has shown how the growth of forgiveness in psychology has given rise to the study of forgiveness interventions . Different types There are various forms of forgiveness interventions . One common adaptation used by researchers is where patients are forced to confront the entity preventing them from forgiving by using introspective techniques and expressing this to the therapist . Another popular forgiveness intervention is getting individual to try to see things from the offender \\'s point of view . The end goal for this adaptation is getting the individual to perhaps understand the reasoning behind the offender \\'s actions . If they are able to do this then they might be able to forgive the offender more easily . Over the past years , there have been researchers who have studied forgiveness interventions in relationships and whether or not prayer increases forgiveness . A study conducted in 2009 found that simply just by praying for a friend or thinking positive thoughts about that individual every day for four weeks demonstrates how prayer positively boosts the chances of forgiving a friend or partner which leads to a better relationship . There is , however , conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions . Contrary evidence Although research has taken into account the positive aspects of forgiveness interventions , there are also negative aspects that have been explored as well . Some researchers have taken a critical approach and have been less accepting of the forgiveness intervention approach to therapy . Critics have argued that forgiveness interventions may actually cause an increase in negative affect because it is trying to inhibit the individual \\'s own personal feelings towards the offender . This can result in the individual feeling negatively towards themself . This approach is categorizing the individual \\'s feelings by implying that the negative emotions the individual is feeling are unacceptable and feelings of forgiveness is the correct and acceptable way to feel . It might inadvertently promote feelings of shame and contrition within the individual . Wanda Malcolm , a registered psychologist , states : \" that it is not a good idea to make forgiveness an a-priori goal of therapy \" . Steven Stosny , also adds , that you heal first then forgive ( NOT forgive then heal ) ; that fully acknowledging the grievance ( both what actions were harmful , and naming the emotions the victim felt as a response to the offenders actions ) is an essential first step , before forgiveness can occur . Some researchers also worry that forgiveness interventions will promote unhealthy relationships . They worry that individuals with toxic relationships will continue to forgive those who continuously commit wrong acts towards them when in fact they should be distancing themselves from these sorts of people . A number of studies showcase high effectiveness rates of forgiveness interventions when done continuously over a long period of time . Some researchers have found that these interventions have been proven ineffective when done over short spans of time . Forgiveness interventions : children There has been some research within the last decade outlining some studies that have looked at the effectiveness of forgiveness interventions on young children . There have also been several studies done studying this cross culturally . One study that explored this relationship , was a study conducted in 2009 by Eadaoin Hui and Tat Sing Chau . In this study , Hui and Chau looked at the relationship between forgiveness interventions and Chinese children who were less likely to forgive those who had wronged them . The findings of this study showed that there was an effect of forgiveness interventions on the young Chinese children . Forgiveness and mental health Survey data from 2000 showed that 61 % of participants that were part of a small religious group reported that the group helped them be more forgiving . Individuals reported that their religion groups which promote forgiveness was related to self-reports of success in overcoming addictions , guilt , and perceiving encouragement when feeling discouraged . It is suggested that mindfulness plays a role in forgiveness and health . The forgiveness of others has a positive effect on physical health when it is combined with mindfulness but evidence shows that forgiveness only effects health as a function of mindfulness . A study from 2005 states that self-forgiveness is an important part of self-acceptance and mental health in later life . The inability to self-forgive can compromise mental health . For some elderly people , self-forgiveness requires reflecting on a transgression to avoid repeating wrongdoings , individuals seek to learn from these transgressions in order to improve their real self-schemas . When individuals are successful at learning from these transgressions , they may experience improved mental health . A study in 2015 looks at how self-forgiveness can reduce feelings of guilt and shame associated with hypersexual behavior . Hypersexual behaviour can have negative effects on individuals by causing distress and life problems . Self-forgiveness may be a component that can help individuals reduce hypersexual negative behaviours that cause problems . Evidence shows that self-forgiveness and procrastination may be associated ; self-forgiveness allows the individual to overcome the negatives associated with an earlier behaviour and engage in approach-oriented behaviours on a similar task . Learning to forgive oneself for procrastination can be positive because it can promote self-worth and may cause positive mental health . Self-forgiveness for procrastination may also reduce procrastination . Everett Worthington , Loren Toussaint and David R . Williams , PhD , proclaimed to have enough research on the effects of forgiveness towards mental health and wrote the self-help book Forgiveness and Health : Scientific Evidence and Theories Relating Forgiveness to Better Health detailing the multiple benefits and psychological results of forgiveness to humans mentally and physically . Toussaint and Worthington claim that stress relief can be the chief factor that connects forgiveness and well-being . Toussaint also found that levels of stress went down when levels of forgiveness rose up , resulting in a decrease in mental health symptoms . Forgiveness gives people a sense that their burden being lifted because they are no longer feeling anger or hatred toward their transgressor . They even begin to understand their transgressor . Since negative emotions and stress are removed from the person seeking forgiveness , overall well-being is improved . They begin to have positive emotions and determinations in life . Forgiveness and physical health The correlation between forgiveness and physical health is a concept that has recently gained traction in research . Some studies claim that there is no correlation , either positive or negative between forgiveness and physical health , and others show a positive correlation . Evidence supporting a correlation Individuals with forgiveness as a personality trait have been shown to have overall better physical health . In a study on relationships , regardless if someone was in a negative or positive relationship , their physical health seemed to be influenced at least partially by their level of forgiveness . Individuals who make a decision to genuinely forgive someone are also shown to have better physical health . This is due to the relationship between forgiveness and stress reduction . Forgiveness is seen as preventing poor physical health and managing good physical health . Specifically individuals who choose to forgive another after a transgression have lower blood pressure and lower cortisol levels than those who do not . This is theorized to be due to various direct and indirect influences of forgiveness , which point to forgiveness as an evolutionary trait . See Broaden and Build Theory . Direct influences include : Reducing hostility ( which is inversely correlated with physical health ) , and the concept that unforgiveness may reduce the immune system because it puts stress on the individual . Indirect influences are more related to forgiveness as a personality trait and include : forgiving people may have more social support and less stressful marriages , and forgiveness may be related to personality traits that are correlated with physical health . Forgiveness may also be correlated with physical health because hostility is associated with poor coronary performance . Unforgiveness is as an act of hostility , and forgiveness as an act of letting go of hostility . Heart patients who are treated with therapy that includes forgiveness to reduce hostility have improved cardiac health compared to those who are treated with medicine alone . Forgiveness may also lead to better perceived physical health . This correlation applies to both self-forgiveness and other-forgiveness but is especially true of self-forgiveness . Individuals who are more capable of forgiving themselves have better perceived physical health . Individuals who partake in forgiving people can sometimes be benefited from the act . For example , people who are willing to forgive others can get healthier hearts , fewer depression symptoms , and less anxiety . Obviously , forgiveness can be seen as somewhat helpful towards mental health especially with people who have mental disorders . Forgiveness can also lead to specific people getting a better immune system . Criticisms Forgiveness studies have been refuted by critics who claim that there is no direct correlation between forgiveness and physical health . Forgiveness , due to the reduction of directed anger , contributes to mental health and mental health contributes to physical health , but there is no evidence that forgiveness directly improves physical health . Most of the studies on forgiveness can not isolate it as an independent variable in an individual \\'s well-being , so it is difficult to prove causation . Further studies imply that while there is not enough research to directly relate forgiveness to physical health there are factors that can be implied . This relates more to physiological measures and what happens to a body during the stages of forgiveness in their daily life . Additionally , research into the correlation between physical health and forgiveness has been criticized for being too focused on unforgiveness . Research shows more about what hostility and unforgiveness contribute to poor health than it shows what forgiveness contributes to physical health . Additionally , research notes that unforgiving or holding grudges can contribute to adverse health outcomes by perpetuating anger and heightening SNS arousal and cardiovascular reactivity . Expression of anger has been strongly associated with chronically elevated blood pressure and with the aggregation of platelets , which may increase vulnerability for heart disease . Self-forgiveness Self-forgiveness happens in situations where an individual has done something that they perceive to be morally wrong and they consider themselves to be responsible for the wrongdoing . Self-forgiveness is the overcoming of negative emotions that the wrongdoer associates with the wrongful action . Negative emotions associated with wrongful action can include guilt , regret , remorse , blame , shame , self-hatred and/or self-contempt . Major life events that include trauma can cause individuals to experience feelings of guilt or self-hatred . Humans have the ability to reflect on their behaviours to determine if their actions are moral . In situations of trauma , humans can choose to self-forgive by allowing themselves to change and live a moral life . Self-forgiveness may be required in situations where the individual hurt themselves or in situations where they hurt others . Indeed , self-forgiveness has been shown to have a moderating effect between depression and suicidality : suggesting self-forgiveness ( up-to a point ) as not only a protective factor of suicide , but also hinting at possible prevention strategies . Therapeutic model Individuals can unintentionally cause harm or offence to one another in everyday life . It is important for individuals to be able to recognize when this happens , and in the process of making amends , have the ability to self-forgive . Specific research suggests that the ability to genuinely forgive one \\'s self can be significantly beneficial to an individual \\'s emotional as well as mental well-being . The research indicates that the ability to forgive one \\'s self for past offences can lead to decreased feelings of negative emotions such as shame and guilt , and can increase the use of more positive practices such as self-kindness and self-compassion . However , it has been indicated that it is possible for the process of self-forgiveness to be misinterpreted and therefore not accurately completed . This could potentially lead to increased feelings of regret or self-blame . In an attempt to avoid this , and increase the positive benefits associated with genuine self-forgiveness , a specific therapeutic model of self-forgiveness has been recommended , which can be used to encourage genuine self-forgiveness in offenders . The model that has been proposed has four key elements . These elements include responsibility , remorse , restoration and renewal . The therapeutic model suggests responsibility as the first necessary step towards genuine self-forgiveness . Research advises that in order to avoid the negative affect associated with emotions such as overwhelming guilt or regret , offenders must first recognize that they have hurt another individual , and accept the responsibility necessary for their actions . Once the individual has accepted responsibility for their offences , it is natural for them to experience feelings of remorse or guilt . However , these feelings can be genuinely processed and expressed preceding the need for restoration . The act of restoration allows the offending individual to make the necessary amends to the individual ( s ) they have hurt . The final component in the model of self-forgiveness is renewal \\' . The offending individual is able to genuinely forgive himself/herself for their past transgressions and can engage in more positive and meaningful behaviors such as self-compassion and self-kindness . Despite the suggested model , research advises that the process of self-forgiveness is not always applicable for every individual . For example , individuals who have not actually caused others any harm or wrongdoing , but instead are suffering from negative emotions such as self-hatred or self-pity , such as victims of assault , might attempt self-forgiveness for their perceived offences . However , this would not be the process necessary for them to make their amends . Additionally , offenders who continue to offend others while attempting to forgive themselves for past offences demonstrate a reluctance to genuinely complete the four stages necessary for self-forgiveness . Research suggests that it is important to first gather exterior information about the individual \\'s perceived offences as well as their needs and motivation for self-forgiveness . Unapologetic forgiveness Being unapologetic is often something that humans come across at some point in their lives , and there has been much research on if a person refuses to apologize or even recognized the wrongdoings . This can then often lead into how one would go into forgiving the unapologetic party and \" the relationship between apologies and the adjectives \\'apologetic \\' and \\'unapologetic \\' is not quite so straightforward . \" People struggle with forgiving people that have done wrongful actions . Causing a person to not forgive themselves or another . It relates to how people feel about the person who is asking for forgiveness . Choosing to forgive someone or not correlates to whether that person is truly sorry for their actions or not . Forgiving a person who does not seem remorseful for their actions can be difficult , but may loosen the grip the person has over you . Intrusive thoughts can cause the person who wants to forgive , to have feelings of low self-worth , and endure a traumatic phase due to that person \\'s actions . Going through a negative experience in your life can cause long term trauma . It can stay in your memory just like a good one . A bad experience will be there too . Holding on to negative emotion is the driving fuel of why people may struggle to heal from their problems in their mind . Having thoughts of revenge may not help a person to heal from the past experience that led them to harbor those negative emotions . They may benefit from letting go and accepting what has happened . Letting go does not erase what the person did , but forgiveness can lead to inner-peace from the lack of negative emotion within . Despite the other person not apologizing sincerely , forgiving them may be the solution to problems and result in loving one \\'s self . Character retributivism Forgiveness could be offered only at significant temporal remove from the wrongdoing . The enforcement of justice , at least with regard to punishing or rewarding , falls outside the purview of personal forgiveness . Forgiveness operates at a different level than justice . Jean Hampton Jean Hampton sees the decision to forgive the unrepentant wrongdoer as expressing a commitment \" to see a wrongdoer in a new , more favorable light \" as one who is not completely rotten or morally dead .

According to Jordanes \\'s Getica , he was a learned philosopher , before whom two other learned men existed , by the names of Zeuta and Deceneus . In modern times , theories and debate on Zalmoxis \\'s religion by such scholars as Mircea Eliade are influenced by considerations of Romanian nationalism as well by pure historical interest . Herodotus Herodotus writes about Zalmoxis in book 4 of his Histories : 93 . ... the Getae are the bravest of the Thracians and the most just . 94 . They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense : they think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis , a divine being ; some call this same divine being Gebeleizis . Every four years , they send a messenger to Zalmoxis , who is chosen by chance . They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion . The mission is performed in the following way : men standing there for that purpose hold three spears ; other people take the one who is sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears . If he dies pierced , they think that the divinity is going to help them ; if he does not die , it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person . And , after he has been charged , they send another one . The messenger is told the requests while he is still alive . The same Thracians , on other occasions , when he thunders and lightens , shoot with arrows up in the air against the sky and menace the divinity because they think there is no god other than their own . Herodotus asserts that Zalmoxis was originally a human being , a slave who converted the Thracians to his beliefs . The Greeks of the Hellespont and the Black Sea tell that Zalmoxis was a slave of Pythagoras , son of Mnesarchos , on the island of Samos . After being liberated , he gathered huge wealth and , once rich , went back to his homeland . Thracians lived simple hard lives . Zalmoxis had lived among the wisest of Greeks , such as Pythagoras , and had been initiated into Ionian life and the Eleusinian Mysteries . He built a banquet hall , and received the chiefs and his fellow countrymen at a banquet . He taught that neither his guests nor their descendants would ever die , but instead would go to a place where they would live forever in complete happiness . He then dug an underground residence . When it was finished , he disappeared from Thrace , living for three years in his underground residence . The Thracians missed him and wept fearing him dead . The fourth year , he came back among them and thus they believed what Zalmoxis had told them . Zalmoxis may have lived much earlier than Pythagoras and was rumored either to be a divine being or from the country of the Getae . \" Now I neither disbelieve nor entirely believe the tale about Salmoxis and his underground chamber ; but I think that he lived many years before Pythagoras ; [ 2 ] and as to whether there was a man called Salmoxis or this is some deity native to the Getae , let the question be dismissed . \" — Herodotus Scholars have several different theories about this account by Herodotus the disappearance and return of Zalmoxis : Herodotus is mocking the barbarian beliefs of the Getae . Zalmoxis created a ritual of passage . This theory is mainly supported by Mircea Eliade , who wrote the first coherent interpretation of the myth about Zalmoxis . Zalmoxis is related to Pythagoras , stating that he founded a mystical cult . This theory may be found in Eliade \\'s work . Zalmoxis is a Christ-like figure who dies and is resurrected . This position was defended by Jean ( Ioan ) Coman , a professor of patristics and Orthodox priest , who was a friend of Mircea Eliade and published in Eliade \\'s journal Zalmoxis , which appeared in the 1930s . This last theory precisely parallels the legend of the universal king Frode , given in both Ynglingsaga and Gesta Danorum of Saxo Grammaticus , particularly Ynglingsaga 12 and Gesta Danorum , in which Frode disappears into the earth for three years after his death . It is difficult to define the time when a cult to Zalmoxis may have existed . It is only certain that it antecedes Herodotus . Some scholars have suggested that the archaic doctrine of Zalmoxis points to a heritage from before the times of Indo-Europeans , but this is difficult , if not impossible , to demonstrate . Plato claims that Zalmoxis was also a great physician who took a holistic approach to healing body and soul ( psyche ) , being thus used by Plato for his own philosophical conceptions . Religion of the Getae Strabo in his Geography mentions a certain Deceneus ( Dékainéos ) whom he calls a γόητα \" magician \" . According to Strabo , king Burebista ( 82–44 BC ) hired Deceneus , who had been in Egypt , to \" tame \" his people . As a sign of the people \\'s obedience , they consented to destroy all their wines as ordered by Deceneus . The \" reform of Deceneus \" is the interpretation by the 6th-century bishop and historian Jordanes , who includes the Getae in his history of the Goths ( as assumed ancestors of the Goths ) . Jordanes describes how Deceneus taught the Getae philosophy and physics . Even if it is more probable that Jordanes interjected his own philosophical knowledge into the text , many modern Romanian authors consider that Deceneus was a priest who reformed the religion of the Getae , changing the worship of Zalmoxis into a popular religion and imposing strict religious rules , such as the restriction of wine consumption . Jean Coman deems this prohibition as the origin of the dietary restrictions followed by the modern Orthodox Church during Lent . According to Iamblichus ( 280-333 AD ) , \" for instructing the Getae in these things , and for having written laws for them , Zalmoxis was by them considered as the greatest of the gods . \" Aristotle is said , in the brief epitome of his Magicus given by Diogenes Laertes , to have compared Zalmoxis with the Phoenician Okhon and Libyan Atlas . Some authors assume Zalmoxis was another name of Sabazius , the Thracian Dionysus , or Zeus . Sabazius appears in Jordanes as Gebelezis . Leaving aside the suffixes -zius/-zis , the root Saba- = Gebele- , suggesting a relationship of the name of the goddess Cybele , as \" Cybele \\'s Zeus \" . Mnaseas of Patrae identified Zalmoxis with Cronos , as does Hesychius , who has \" \" . In Plato \\'s writings , Zalmoxis is mentioned as skilled in the arts of incantation . Zalmoxis gave his name to a particular type of singing and dancing ( Hesych ) . His realm as a god is not very clear , as some considered him to be a sky-god , a god of the dead , or a god of the Mysteries . Lactantius ( an early Christian author , c . 240–320 AD ) , referring to the religion of the Getae , provides an approximate translation of Julian the Apostate \\'s purported quotation of Trajan : \" We have conquered even these Getai ( Dacians ) , the most warlike of all people that have ever existed , not only because of the strength in their bodies , but , also due to the teachings of Zalmoxis who is among their most hailed . He has told them that in their hearts they do not die , but change their location and , due to this , they go to their deaths happier than on any other journey . \" Zalmoxian religion The \" Zalmoxian religion \" is the subject of a scholarly debate that has continued since the beginning of the 20th century . According to some scholars , such as Vasile Pârvan , Jean Coman , R . Pettazzon , E . Rohde and Sorin Paliga , since ancient sources do not mention any god of the Getae other than Zalmoxis , the Getae were monotheistic . However , Herodotus is the only ancient author who explicitly states that the Getae had only one divinity . The sending of a messenger to Zalmoxis and the fact that Getae shot arrows towards the sky have prompted some authors to believe Zalmoxis was a sky god , but his journey into a cavern has led others to suggest that he was a chthonic divinity . A third group of scholars believe that the Getae , like other Indo-European peoples , were polytheistic . They draw on ancient authors such as Diodorus Siculus , who states that the Getae worshipped Hestia as well as Zalmoxis . Etymology A number of etymologies have been given for the name . In his Vita Pythagorae , Porphyrius ( 3rd century ) says that he was so named because he had been wrapped in a bearskin at birth , and zalmon is the Thracian word for \" hide \" ( ) . Hesychius ( ca . 5th century ) has zemelen ( ζέμελεν ) as a Phrygian word for \" foreign slave \" . The correct spelling of the name is also uncertain . Manuscripts of Herodotus \\' Historiae have all four spellings , viz . Zalmoxis , Salmoxis , Zamolxis , Samolxis , with a majority of manuscripts favouring Salmoxis . Later authors show a preference for Zamolxis . Hesychius quotes Herodotus , using Zalmoxis . The -m-l- variant ( Zamolxis ) is favoured by those wishing to derive the name from a conjectured Thracian word for \" earth \" , * zamol . Comparisons have also been made with the name of Zemelo and Žemelė , the Phrygian and Lithuanian goddess of the earth , and with the Lithuanian chthonic god Žemeliūkštis . The Lithuanian word Žalmuo means \" corn shoot \" or \" fresh grass \" . Žalmokšnis is another possible form of it . The -l-m- variant is admitted to be the older form and the correct form by the majority of Thracologists , as this is the form found in the older Herodotus manuscripts and other ancient sources . The -l-m- form is further attested in Daco-Thracian in Zalmodegikos , the name of a Getic King ; and in Thracian zalmon , \\'hide \\' , and zelmis , \\'hide \\' ( PIE * kel- , \\'to cover \\' ; cf . English helm ) . The other name for Zalmoxis , Gebeleizis , is also spelled Belaizis and Belaixis in Herodotus manuscripts . According to Mircea Eliade : In popular culture The Romanian rock band Sfinx worked from around 1975 through 1978 on Zalmoxe , a progressive rock LP , with lyrics by poet Alexandru Basarab ( actually a pen name for Adrian Hoajă ) , which retold the story of Zalmoxis . The dinosaur Zalmoxes is named after the deity . See also Allegory of the cave Analogy of the sun Notes References Primary sources Herodotus . Histories , Book IV . 93-96 Herodotus .

Ancient Greek shamans Dacian gods Life-death-rebirth gods People whose existence is disputed Thracian gods Year of death unknown', 'The Atom is a name shared by five fictional comic book superheroes from the DC Comics universe . The original Golden Age Atom , Al Pratt , was created by writer Bill O\\'Connor and artist Ben Flinton and first appeared in All-American Publications \\' All-American Comics # 19 ( October 1940 ) . The second Atom was the Silver Age Atom , Ray Palmer , who first appeared in 1961 . The third Atom , Adam Cray , was a minor character present in Suicide Squad stories . The fourth Atom , Ryan Choi , debuted in a new Atom series in August 2006 . Another Atom from the 853rd Century first appeared as part of Justice Legion Alpha in August 1999 . The Atom has been the star of multiple solo series , and four of the five have appeared as members of various superhero teams , such as the Justice Society of America , the Justice League , the Suicide Squad , and the Justice Legion Alpha . Fictional character biographies Al Pratt The original Atom , Al Pratt , first appeared in All-American Comics # 19 ( October 1940 ) . He initially had no superpowers ; instead , he was a diminutive college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy , a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference . Pratt was a founding member of the Justice Society of America , later gaining limited super-strength , and an energy charged \\'atomic punch \\' . He died in the charge against Extant during the Zero Hour . Ray Palmer The Atom introduced during the Silver Age of comic books in Showcase # 34 ( 1961 ) is physicist and university professor Raymond Palmer , Ph.D . ( He was named for real-life science fiction writer Raymond A . Palmer , who was himself quite short . ) After stumbling onto a mass of white dwarf star matter that had fallen to Earth , he fashioned a lens which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size . Originally , his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume , controlled by mechanisms in his belt , and later by controls in the palms of his gloves . Much later , he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body . After the events of Identity Crisis , Ray shrank himself to microscopic size and disappeared . Finding him became a major theme of the Countdown year-long series and crossover event . Paul Hoben Prior to Ray Palmer \\'s trip to the Amazon Jungle , he learns his wife Jean Loring has had an affair with her colleague , Paul Hoben . Palmer and Loring got a divorce . Later , Palmer offers his blessing to the couple when they marry , and he offers Hoben his size-changing belt so that Hoben can protect Ivy Town after Ray returns to the Morlaidhans . Adam Cray would later steal this belt ; Hoben never uses the costume or name of the Atom . Adam Cray Adam Cray , son of the murdered Senator Joseph Cray , first appeared as the Atom in the pages of Suicide Squad # 44 by John Ostrander ( August 1990 ) . Cray was initially believed to be Ray Palmer in disguise by members of the team . Cray had been recruited by Palmer ( who faked his own death ) to apprehend the Micro Squad , a group of villains that had been reduced in size . Palmer intended to use Cray to uncover a shadowy government cabal which was using Palmer to discover the secret identities of other costumed heroes ( Palmer \\'s own identity no longer being secret ) . While Palmer infiltrated the Micro Squad , Cray would attract the attention of the Cabal as the new Atom so that no one would notice Palmer assuming the identity of a fallen Micro Squad member . Adam Cray remained with the Suicide Squad briefly , serving as a secret weapon whose existence was unknown to others of the Squad . Cray saves Amanda Waller from a group of assassins . At one point , Cray approaches Deadshot about his role in Senator Cray \\'s murder . Later , Cray is impaled through the chest with a screw by Blacksnake , a Micro Squad member who believes him to be Palmer . After the unanticipated murder of Cray , Palmer reveals himself and defeats Cray \\'s murderer . The ruse ended , Palmer explains himself to the Justice League , who had been searching for him after hearing rumors of a new Atom . During the events of Blackest Night , Adam \\'s corpse is reanimated as a member of the Black Lantern Corps alongside several other fallen Suicide Squad members . Following his reanimation , Adam and the other Black Lanterns travel to Belle Reve and attack Bane and Black Alice . Adam is apparently destroyed by the Manhunter \\'s self-destruct mechanism , unleashing an explosion of Green Lantern energy that eradicates the Black Lanterns . In DC Rebirth , Adam Cray is the son of Senator Cray and Ryan Choi \\'s roommate at Ivy University . Senator Cray also attended Ivy and expected Adam to attend Ivy as well . He first meets Ryan when he walks into their dorm with heavy luggage and kindly introduces himself . Adam teaches Ryan how to play rugby and video games . Ryan Choi Ryan Choi , as described by DC solicitations , is \" a young hotshot professor who \\'s filling the extra spot on Ivy University \\'s teaching staff . .. and who inadvertently ends up filling the old Atom \\'s super-heroic shoes \" . This new Atom is based on a redesign by Grant Morrison . He debuted in the Brave New World one-shot , a preview of projects , and then appeared in the series The All-New Atom , written by Gail Simone . He is later murdered by Deathstroke and his Titans . Rhonda Piñeda/Atomica In September 2011 , The New 52 rebooted DC \\'s continuity . In this new timeline , a new , female Atom is introduced , Rhonda Piñeda , a Hispanic American college student from Ivy Town . She is revealed to be working as a reluctant spy for Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor , gathering intel on the new Justice League recruits . She is noted to be \" the most important member of the Justice League of America \" by Steve Trevor . At the conclusion of the \" Trinity War \" storyline , she is revealed to in fact be betraying both teams ; she hails from the alternate universe of Earth-3 , where she is a member of the Crime Syndicate operating under the name Atomica . She also reveals that by placing a sliver of Green Kryptonite in Superman \\'s optic nerve , she caused him to accidentally kill Doctor Light , with the added effect of severely weakening and almost killing Superman over time . Atomica originally worked on Earth-3 with Johnny Quick as a thief and killer . One night after killing two cops , they are cornered on the roof of S.T.A.R . Labs during a storm . Lightning hits a satellite , electrocuting Johnny and granting him speed powers . Rhonda falls inside the building and lands near Ray Palmer \\'s Atomico work , gaining size- and density-changing powers . During the final battle with the Crime Syndicate , Atomica reduces her size and is killed when Lex Luthor steps on her . Following the reboot of the multiverse after Dark Nights : Death Metal , a new Earth-3 and Atomica are created . Atomica is the lover of speedster serial killer Johnny Quick and accompanies him on his high-speed murder spree across Central City . Atom One Million An unnamed scientist in the 853rd Century performed experiments in superstring theory that creates a singularity and whose radiation alters his physical make-up . When the singularity threatened to expand and destroy his universe , he enters it in an attempt to save the universe but instead finds himself on an interdimensional bridge to another universe as his own is wiped out , unable to stop it . At the end of the bridge , he finds Superman Prime who came to help but was too late . Stranded , he searches this universe for remnants of the one he lost , in time taking the name the Atom and joining the Justice Legion Alpha when he helped them defeat the Bizarro-Legion . This Atom \\'s powers differ from his predecessors in that he does n\\'t shrink but breaks up into several smaller duplicates of himself divided amongst his mass . At atomic size , these duplicates can mimic elements such as gold and oxygen .

Tangent Comics In the Tangent Comics imprint , the Atom is \" Arthur Harrison Thompson \" , a subject of radiation testing on human beings . The first hero in the Tangent timeline , he inadvertently caused the Cuban Missile Crisis to escalate into a limited nuclear exchange that obliterated Florida and Cuba in 1962 , unknown to his fellow Americans . Thompson was succeeded by his son , who was killed by the Tangent Comics version of the Fatal Five , and a grandson named Adam , who , in Tangent : Superman \\'s Reign , is being held captive by Superman . It is suggested in the Tangent series that the Atom \\'s name was at least in part chosen because of the abbreviation of his full name \" Arthur Harrison Thompson \" on his barracks door to simply \" A . Thom . \" Also in the Tangent series , the Atom \\'s presence as America \\'s first superhero during the 1960s has led to a huge cultural impact , and in this world many significant points in pop culture have been effected by his presence ; for instance The Beatles choose to be called \" The Atomiks \" , further more TV shows such as The Beverly Hillbillies became The Superman Hillbillies , The Dick Van Dyke Show became The Dick Van Hero Show and Get Smart became Get Powers . Elseworlds Some other re-imaginings of the Atom include an appearance in League of Justice , a story portraying the Justice League in a The Lord of the Rings-type story where the Atom was recast as a wizard/fortune teller called \" Atomus The Palmer \" . Al Pratt as the Atom was one of the three heroes who chose to work at the side of Senator Thompson in The Golden Age . When Al discovers that Thompson is really the Ultra-Humanite , he joins the other heroes against the villain and Dyna-Man . The Al Pratt Atom appeared in JSA : The Unholy Three as a post-WW2 intelligence agent with transparent atomic flesh and a visible skeleton.JLA : Age of Wonder where Ray Palmer worked with a science consortium whose numbers at one point included Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla.JLA : Created Equal , after Ray Palmer is killed in the cosmic storm that nearly wipes out the rest of the male population on Earth , a graduate student named Jill Athron is given a research grant to study Palmer \\'s white-dwarf-star-belt . She becomes the Atom and joins the Justice League . Atom evolved from a hawkman that had evolved from Robin in the Just Imagine ... comic book . 52 Multiverse In the final issue of 52 , a new Multiverse is revealed , originally consisting of 52 identical realities . Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \" Earth-2 \" . As a result of Mister Mind \" eating \" aspects of this reality , it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-2 , including the Atom among other Justice Society of America characters . The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear , but the Atom is visually similar to the Al Pratt Atom . Based on comments by Grant Morrison , this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-2 . In Countdown # 30 , the Challengers from Beyond encountered Earth-15 , a world where the sidekicks had taken their mentor \\'s places . On this Earth , the Atom is Jessica Palmer , a genius who graduated from MIT at age eight . The Search for Ray Palmer - Red Son features the Ray Palmer of Earth-30 , an American captured by the Superman of a communist Russia . Countdown : Arena also depicts the Ray Palmer of Earth-6 , who through unknown circumstances now has the powers and title of the Ray . The Search For Ray Palmer : Superwoman/Batwoman briefly features a female version of The Atom .

However , he was never convicted of any crime . As the law was now aware of his superhero identity , Pratt retired from heroics . As Doctor Fate later stated , \" The Atom split \" . Arrowverse The Ray Palmer and Ryan Choi versions appear in the Arrowverse portrayed by Brandon Routh and Osric Chau respectively . Ray Palmer Ray Palmer first appeared as a recurring character in Arrows third season . He is introduced as a brilliant scientist with an I.Q . of 140 , 4 PhDs , and the CEO of Palmer Technologies , which used to be Queen Consolidated before Ray bought and rebranded it . After his fiancé , Anna Loring , was murdered by Deathstroke \\'s soldiers during the second season , he vowed to never let anything like that happen again . To achieve this , he devoted much of his efforts to building an exo-suit with built-in weapons and flight capability . He also had plans to rebuild Starling City and rechristen it as \" Star City \" . He hired Felicity Smoak to work for him and eventually started dating her , which made Oliver Queen jealous . After successfully building his suit , Ray discovered Oliver \\'s identity as the \" Arrow \" and his affection for Felicity , so he planned to apprehend him . Upon learning Oliver was being framed by a criminal who targeted Felicity next , Ray saved her . Though he was shot during the rescue , he used micro-technology to save himself . By the season finale , Ray broke up with Felicity and assisted Oliver \\'s team in defeating Ra \\'s al Ghul from destroying Starling City before he was apparently killed in an explosion while working on new technology for his suit . In season four , Ray was presumed dead , leading to Starling City being renamed \" Star City \" in his honor and Felicity inheriting Palmer Technologies . In reality , Ray survived via his micro-tech , which shrunk him and his suit to a miniature size . He attempted to contact Felicity , with no success as she had left the city when the explosion occurred . However , one of his messages was intercepted by Damien Darhk , who captured Ray and attempted to use his technology for sinister means . Once Felicity eventually discovered Ray was alive and in Darhk \\'s captivity , she worked with Oliver and his team to rescue him and restore him to his normal size . Upon learning that Star City largely did not care about him following his apparent death , Ray chose to maintain the deception until he could figure out how to move on with his life . Routh appeared as Ray during The Flashs first-season episode , \" All-Star Team-Up \" ; wherein he helped the titular character combat a villain using a swarm of robotic bees to attack those who ruined her career . Routh also appears as Ray in the spin-off series Legends of Tomorrow as part of the main cast . In the first season , he is recruited by time-traveler Rip Hunter to help him defeat the immortal Vandal Savage across the timeline as one of his \" Legends \" . Believing he wasted his life and wishing to revitalize it , Ray accepted due in part to his enthusiasm and optimism overriding his lack of practical experience , which occasionally presented itself throughout the show . While working with the Legends , he used dwarf star-based technology to grant his exo-suit the ability to shrink to miniature size and grow to gigantic proportions like his comic book counterpart He also assisted in turning the Legends \\' historian ally Nate Heywood into the superhero Steel and entered a relationship with Damien Darhk \\'s daughter , Nora ; eventually going on to marry her and leave the Legends in the show \\'s fifth season so they could live out their lives together . Routh also reprised his role for a minor appearance in the animated web series Vixen .

After a rather intense but successful training session , Micron got a distress call from an unknown source about a monorail gone haywire . After saving the only person on board ― its driver ― he tried to prevent the monorail from colliding with another coming in the opposite direction . Micron disengaged the train from its track , and then derailed it . Right when he tried to get out of the plummeting train , the door suddenly closed and a force-field barricaded Micron inside . The train crashed into a building , leaving Micron badly injured . Little did he know that the person responsible for the wreck was Superman , who was under the control of Starro . Micron was placed in a stasis field , where he slowly recovered . Sometime later , Starro/Superman tried to sabotage the field and finish Micron off . However , this attempt was promptly interrupted by the other Leaguers . A battle ensued , and Micron mustered enough strength to get out of the tank , and snatched Superman with his magnified hand . However , he was still feeble , so Superman easily knocked him unconscious . Micron was then returned to the stasis field , where he most likely recovered in short time .

Guede spirits include Guede-Double , Guede-Linto , Guede L\\'Orage , Guede Nibo and Guede Ti Malice . All are known for the drum rhythm and dance called the \" banda \" . In possession , they will drink or rub themselves with a mixture of clairin ( raw rum ) and twenty-one scotch bonnet or goat peppers . Fête Guede or Fête Ghede ( ) is celebrated on 2 November , All Souls \\' Day ( \" Festival of the Dead \" ) . Boons granted by the Guede not repaid by this date will be avenged afterwards . Papa Guede is the corpse of the first man who ever died . He is recognized as a short , dark man with a high hat on his head who likes to smoke cheap cigars and eat apples . Papa Guede is a psychopomp who waits at the crossroads to take souls into the afterlife . He is considered the good counterpart to Baron Samedi . If a child is dying , Papa Guede is prayed to . It is believed that he will not take a life before its time and that he will protect the little ones . Papa Guede has a very crass sense of humor , a divine ability to read others \\' minds , and the ability to know everything that happens in the worlds of the living and the dead . Brave Guede is the guardian and watchman of the graveyard . He keeps the dead souls in and the living souls out . He is sometimes considered an aspect of Nibo . Guede Bábáco is Papa Guede \\'s lesser known brother and is also a psychopomp . His role is somewhat similar to that of Papa Guede , but he does n\\'t have the special abilities of his brother . Guede Nibo is a psychopomp , an intermediary between the living and the dead . He was the first person to die by violence , so he is the patron of those who died by unnatural causes ( disaster , accident , misadventure , or violence ) . He is the guardian of the graves of those who died prematurely , particularly those whose final resting place is unknown . His chevals ( \" horses \" , possessed devotees ) can give voice to the dead spirits whose bodies have not been found or that have not been reclaimed from \" below the waters \" . Baron Criminel ( \" Baron of Criminals \" ) is the enforcer of the Guede . He was the first person to kill another ( probably Nibo ) . As the first murderer , he is master of those who murder or use violence to harm others . Families of murder victims and the abused pray to him to get revenge on those who wronged them . His \" horses \" have an insatiable appetite and will attack people until they are offered food . If it does n\\'t please them or takes too long , they will bite and chew on anyone nearby ( or even themselves ) until they are sated . He is syncretized with St . Martin de Porres , perhaps because his feast day is November 3 , the day after Fête Guede . He is sacrificed black roosters that have been bound , doused with strong spirit , and then set alight . Maman Brigitte ( \" Mother Bridget \" ) is the wife of Baron Samedi . She is syncretized with St . Brigid , perhaps because she is the protector of crosses and gravestones . Marassa : The divine twins The Guede loa have their own versions of the Twins , which appear as gravediggers . Twins are seen as having divine insight and vision . They also are part in the material world and the spiritual world ( in their case , the living and the dead ) . They usually wear contrasting colors . Guede Masaka assists Guede Nibo . He is an androgynous male gravedigger and spirit of the dead , recognized by his black shirt , white jacket , and white headscarf . Guede Oussou wears a black or mauve jacket marked on the back with a white cross and a black or mauve headscarf . His name means \" tipsy \" due to his love of white rum . Guede Oussou is sometimes also linked with the female Guede L\\'Oraille . The Guede Barons The Guede are closely associated with the loa , Baron , whose aspects are Baron Samedi ( Baron Saturday ) - ruler of the graveyard , Baron La Croix ( Baron The Cross ) - guardian of the gravestone , and Baron Cimetière ( Baron Cemetery ) - guardian of the grave . Depending on the tradition followed , Baron is : one of the Guede their spiritual protector , who has raised them from the dead with the help of Baron Samedi \\'s wife , Maman Brigitte . An aspect of the Guede gods . In any of these configurations , Baron , Maman Brigitte , and the Guede rule death , the cemetery , and the grave .

References Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Vaud\", 'Èṣù is an Òrìṣà/Irúnmọlẹ̀ in the religion of the Yoruba people . Èṣù is a prominent primordial Divinity ( a delegated Irúnmọlẹ̀ sent by the Olódùmarè ) who descended from Ìkọ̀lé Ọ̀run , and the Chief Enforcer of natural and divine laws - he is the Deity in charge of law enforcement and orderliness . As the religion has spread around the world , the name of this Orisha has varied in different locations , but the beliefs remain similar . Brief The other names of the Irúnmọlẹ̀ called Èṣù includes Ẹlẹ́jẹ̀lú , Olúlànà , Ọbasìn , Láarúmọ̀ , Ajọ́ńgọ́lọ̀ , Ọba Ọ̀dàrà , Onílé Oríta , Ẹlẹ́gbára Ọ̀gọ , Olóògùn Àjíṣà , Láàlú Ògiri Òkò , Láàlù Bara Ẹlẹ́jọ́ , Láaróyè Ẹbọra tí jẹ́ Látọpa . Èṣù is powerful , relevant , and ubiquitous to the extent of having every day of the four-day ( ancient/traditional ) Yorùbá week as his day of worship ( Ọjọ́ Ọ̀ṣẹ̀ ) , unlike all other Irúnmọlẹ̀s and Òrìṣàs ( primordial Divinities and deified Ancestor Spirits ; \" ọjọ́ gbogbo ni ti Èṣù Ọ̀darà \" . The controversial cognomen ; A-bá-ni-wá-ọ̀ràn-bá-ò-rí-dá ( He-who-creates-problems-for-the-innocent ) highlights the complexity of the nature of this highly unpredictable Deity called Èṣù Ọba Ọ̀dàrà ( who has his abode at crossroads ) across all strata of Yorùbá society in general and of spiritual communities in particular . Èṣù is a personification of Mischief ; he is the one who teaches that there are always two sides or more to every issue . He balanced and created directions . Èṣù is so necessary to an ordered life ! According to Oluwo Aderemi Ifaoleepin Aderemi from Oyo Alaafin , to the criminally minded who celebrate wickedness , injustice , and immorality and unrighteous people , Èṣù Láàlù is evil and devilish , whilst Láaróyè Ajọ́ńgọ́lọ̀ Ọkùnrin Òde is an awesome and persuasive Divinity to pious and morally upright people who place a premium on justice , morality , and good character . Èṣù is the messenger not only to the Olódùmarè , but also to the other Irúnmọlẹ̀s/Òrìṣàs . He is also the intermediary between Ajoguns ( evil spirits ) to the Irúnmọlẹ̀s/Òrìṣàs and the ẹ̀dá èèyàn ( human beings ) ; he is the one who distributes , and also supervises the distribution of sacrifices ( ẹbọ ) to the Ajoguns . Name and role Èṣùu partially serves as an alternate name for Eleggua , the messenger for all Orishas , and that there are 256 paths to Eleggua—each one of which is an Eshu . It is believed that Èṣù of the ìṣẹ̀ṣe Religion is an Òrìṣà similar to Eleggua , but there are only 101 paths to Eshu according to ocha , rather than the 256 paths to Eleggua according to Ifá . Èṣù is known as the \" Father who gave birth to Ogboni \" , and is also thought to be agile and always willing to rise to a challenge . Both ocha and Ifá share some paths , however . Eshu Ayé is said to work closely with all Òrìṣà including Òrìṣà Olokun and is thought to walk on the shore of the beach . Èṣù Bi is a stern and forceful avatar , appearing as both an old man and young boy , who walked with Shangó and Oyá ( the initial two Ibeyi ) , and Eshu Bi protects both of these , as well as all other small children . Eshu Laroye is an avatar believed to be the companion of Oshún and believed to be one of the most important Eshus , and the avatar of Eshu Laroye is thought to be talkative and small . Èṣù is always at the middle of divergent world forces . He controls and regulates the two extremes - the world of happiness , joy , and fulfilment , as well as the arena of destruction , hopelessness , and sorrow . Èṣù always demands from those who have to give to those demanded for it within the premises of sacrifices , rituals , and propitiation . He maintains the delicate balance of good and bad - just and unjust . He protects towns and villages , Priests and Priestess ( àwọn Ẹlẹ́gùn - tí wọ́n ní ẹ̀rẹ́ ní Ìpàkọ́ , and Devotees and Awos against evil machinations . And he always favours those that performed the necessary and appropriate sacrifices ( ẹbọs ) and other forms of rituals ; \" ẹni tó bá rúbọ l\\'Èṣù ń gbè \" ! Èṣù Láàlù is a bosom friend , working partner , confidant , and close associate of Ọ̀rúnmìlà Baraà mi Àgbọnnìrègún , the one who practises and teaches Ifá - an esoteric language of Olódùmarè ( containing divine message of life ) through a very complex divinatory system , and who also teaches wisdom . Other names The name of Eshu varies around the world : in Yorùbáland , Eshu is Èṣù-Elegba or Laolu-Ogiri Oko ; Exu de Candomblé in Candomblé ; Echú in Santería and Latin America ; Legba in Haitian Vodou ; Leba in Winti ; Exu de Quimbanda in Quimbanda ; Lubaniba in Palo Mayombe ; and Exu in Latin America . Brazil Exu is known by various forms and names in Afro-Brazilian religions . They include Akessan ; Alafiá ; Alaketo ; Bará , or Ibará ; Elegbá , or Elegbará , Inan ; Lalu , or Jelu ; Laroiê ; Lon Bií ; Lonã ; Odara ; Olodé ; Tamenta , or Etamitá ; Tlriri . The most common forms or praise-names of Exu are Exu-Agbo , the protector and guardian of houses and terreiros ; Exu-Elepô , the god of palm oil ; Exu lnã , the god of fire ; and Exu Ojixé , a messenger god . Candomblé A shrine dedicated to Exu is located outside of the main terreiro of a Candomblé temple , usually near the entrance gate . It is , in general , made of a simple mound of red clay . These shrines are similar to those found in Nigeria . Ritual foods offered to Exu include palm oil ; beans ; corn , either in the form of cornmeal or popcorn ; and farofa , a manioc flour . Four-legged male birds and other animals are offered as sacrifice to Exu . In each offering made to an orixá , a part of the food is separated and dedicated to Exu . Umbanda In the Syncretic religion of Umbanda , Exu may have a different meaning . Usually in Umbanda Exu is not considered a single Deity , but many different spirits . Some of the most popular versions of Exu are Exu Caveira ( \" Skull Exu \" , represented as a skeleton ) , Exu Tranca-Rua ( \" Street Locker \" , opener and closer of spiritual ways ) and Exu Mirim ( \" Little Exu \" , a spirit that resembles the personality of a child or teenager ) . In Umbanda , a Pombagira ( female consort of Exu ) may also be considered a kind of Exu , commonly venerated in the practice of Brazilian Love magic . Controversy on English translations and on Google From the time of the first English translations of Yorùbá words in the mid nineteenth century , Èṣù has been rendered as \" devil \" or \" satan \" . The first known instance of this came from Samuel Ajayi Crowther \\'s \" Vocabulary of the Yoruba \" ( 1842 ) where his entries for \" Satan \" and \" Devil \" had Eshu in English . Subsequent dictionaries over the years have followed suit , permeating popular culture and Yorùbá societies as well . Lately , many online campaigns have been set up to protest this , and many activists have worked to correct it . There have also been quite a number of academic work examining the mistranslation . The translation on Google Translate took up the same earlier mistranslations . This led to a number of online campaigns until 2016 when Nigerian linguist and writer Kola Tubosun , then an employee at Google , first changed it back to less derogatory connotations . When the changes were reverted , he changed them again in 2019 . The translation for Èṣù to English now remains \" Èṣù \" while \" devil \" and \" satan \" translate to \" bìlísì \" and \" sàtánì \" respectively . Appearances in popular culture Eshu appears in K . A . Applegate \\'s fantasy series Everworld , serving as the main antagonist of its eighth book , Brave the Betrayal . He is a trickster god who tries many times to emotionally manipulate and mentally break the book \\'s narrator , Jalil Sherman , but is ultimately defeated when Jalil proves too strong to give in to his mental tricks and magical illusions . The 1974 blaxploitation film Abby features Eshu , but mostly as a deranged and ruthless sex deity that possesses a young woman and causes her to sexually assault and brutally murder various men in the process . Eshu appears as the main antagonist of the film Scooby-Doo ! Ghastly Goals .

Doc Daneeka is a fictional character in the 1961 novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller . Doc Daneeka is the squadron physician and a friend of the novel \\'s protagonist , Yossarian . \" Catch-22 \" itself is first explained in the novel when Yossarian asks Doc Daneeka to excuse him from combat duty . Doc Daneeka is also the title of Chapter 4 of the novel . Character sketch Motivations Doc Daneeka \\'s main motivation throughout is for his own welfare , if that be making money or protecting his own life . He generally forgets his moral duty as a physician except in the most extreme of circumstances . Goals Doc Daneeka \\'s goal before he is drafted into the war is to make a successful business out of his medical practice based in New York , he has stated that \" my most valuable medical tool is my cash register \" . He lies to the drafting board about his health in an attempt to avoid the war and become well-off , as the competition is drafted instead . Once he is drafted his main goal is to get through the war alive . He is a hypochondriac who never gets ill , and is looking to avoid anything that would increase the risk to his life . He sees unnecessary risks to include displeasing his superiors for grounding crew and being shipped off to the Pacific Ocean , water and its ability to drown a man , and having to fly in a claustrophobic aircraft , which he likens to \" climbing back into the womb \" . Relationships and conflicts Doc Daneeka is regularly explaining to his good friend Yossarian why he can not ground him , even though Yossarian helps him collect his flight pay without having to fly . His fears and the constraints of military bureaucracy prevent him from helping his friend . He shows unusual compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden . Doc Daneeka feels the military is responsible for his being drafted into the war effort and put in harm \\'s way , because they were distrustful of him when he lied on his drafting papers about his health . He is constantly scared of upsetting his superiors who may see fit to then ship him off to the far more dangerous South Pacific . Already he sees it as military cruelty to have been assigned to the Air Corps even though he is scared of flying . Doc Daneeka , as squadron physician , is meant to supervise Gus and Wes who run the medical tent . He generally shows little care for the way they run the tent , basically leaving the growing bureaucracy to decide who is ill enough to be sent to hospital , without reference to medical expertise . This climaxes when Gus and Wes pronounce Doc Daneeka dead at the medical tent against the obvious fact that he is standing alive in front of them . Doc Daneeka finally falls foul of the bureaucratic processes that are central to Catch-22 : when McWatt flies his plane into the mountain after he accidentally kills Kid Sampson , Doc Daneeka \\'s name is on McWatt \\'s crew manifest . Doc Daneeka was not on board the plane , but had an arrangement with McWatt to falsely record his name on the manifest so he could collect flight pay . Doc Daneeka attempts in vain to convince the bureaucracy that he is alive , but the process has already started . He tries to convince his wife that he is not dead , but fails . His wife gives up on him as his death leads to her financial benefit . Doc Daneeka is forced to share a tent with Chief White Halfoat , whom he is scared of . He is also concerned that he will catch pneumonia from Chief White Halfoat , who is obsessed that he will soon die of pneumonia . Epiphanies During Milo \\'s bombing of the airbase and the death of Snowden , Doc Daneeka shows the compassion for others he lacks throughout the rest of the novel . During the bombing , Doc Daneeka risks his life by attending to the wounded in the field while bombs are still falling , and after Snowden \\'s death , he cleans up Yossarian and treats him for shock . At the end , Doc Daneeka \\'s bureaucratic death convinces him that maybe he is , in fact , dead . Biographical summary Actions in Catch-22 At home Doc Daneeka was a physician in his hometown of Staten Island , where he initially established a failing practice . As the war effort drafts in more medical personnel , Doc Daneeka \\'s surgery booms , especially with increased kickbacks from the local pharmacies and abortion referrals from the beauty parlors . This lucrative business comes to an end when the military catch up with him after he lies to the draft board about having one leg amputated and being bed-ridden with incurable rheumatoid arthritis . Doc describes only one experience of his practice at home : a young newlywed couple who are unable to procreate . Doc finds out the girl is still a virgin and is cheeky when he asks about the medal of Saint Anthony that lies between her bosom , and the terrible temptation that this must be for Saint Anthony . When he asks the husband how often they have sex , he boasts \" Every night \" . Doc concludes they have no idea , and with the aid of two rubber models gives a demonstration of intercourse . They thank him for his help and go away to give it a try . Later , the husband returns and , punching him in the nose , cries , \" What are you , some kind of wise guy ? \" In Pianosa Doc Daneeka appears as a petulant man , feeling beaten by the military for losing his advantage of being one of few doctors around back home . As a military doctor , Doc Daneeka has the ability to choose who of the pilots can be grounded from needing to fly more missions , and who must continue . Because of Colonel Cathcart \\'s competing attitude of increasing the missions every time the men meet the requirement , pilots with successful fruition grovel for Doc Daneeka to allow them grounding . Since Doc Daneeka is miserably sour for losing out on his business advantage , he takes it out on the men by not grounding any . Doc Daneeka is a hypochondriac , who feels something must be physically wrong with himself . He also vainly attempts to remove himself from the military effort ; he regularly approaches Gus and Wes , his two nurses , to perform routine physical and check his temperature , which invariably remains a constant , sub-average 96.8 degrees Fahrenheit . Gus and Wes Gus and Wes assist Doc Daneeka and take the responsibility for dealing with the majority of people who visit the medical tent where they have \" succeeded in elevating medicine to an exact science \" . Gus and Wes is actually a single character . Their utilitarian method of dealing with any person presenting themselves at the medical tent is to take their temperature . Those with temperatures above 102° Fahrenheit are sent to the hospital ; those below 102° have their gums and toes painted purple with gentian violet solution and are given a laxative that is quickly disposed of in the bushes . Those with temperatures of exactly 102° are asked to return in an hour to have their temperatures taken again . The only exception to this is Yossarian , who normally runs a temperature of 101° , but who can go to the hospital whenever he wants because he is not afraid of them . Gus and Wes appear to represent organizational functionaries that anyone who has had the misfortune of dealing with an impersonal bureaucracy should recognize . Why me ? Doc Daneeka shows he has a total lack of empathy for anyone else and he can only think about his own unfortunate circumstances , characterised with his constant lament \" Why me ? \" From bemoaning his loss of a lucrative medical business because he had lied on his drafting papers , to his complete lack of interest for those under his care that may result him being punished by is superiors if he did care . Even when Yossarian helps Doc Daneeka by allowing him to get his flight pay without actually doing the required number of flights ( because he is scared of flying ) he will not help : \" You do a favor for me , I \\'ll do one for you . Get it ? \" \" Do one for me , \" Yossarian requested . \" Not a chance , \" Doc Daneeka responded . This is in total contrast to what might be expected of doctors following the Hippocratic Oath . The Doc does redeem himself , when during Milo \\'s bombing of the airbase , the Doc \" loses his head \" and works continuously in the field helping the wounded . Also he shows compassion to Yossarian after the death of Snowden over Avignon , by covering him in a blanket and cleaning up Snowden ’ s blood from Yossarian ’ s clothes . Dr Stubbs Dr Stubbs is the doctor in Dunbar \\'s squadron . Dr . Stubbs decides to try to confront the rules of Catch-22 by grounding any soldier who asks . Catch-22 can not be beaten though , as the grounding orders are short-lived as they are rescinded by higher authorities and the soldiers are put back on duty . As punishment Dr Stubbs is transferred to the Pacific , which is one of Doc Daneeka \\'s greatest fears . Catch-22 Yossarian is Doc Daneeka \\'s only friend on the base . Yossarian , like the other flying officers , continually begs for grounding , although he never successfully accomplishes the number of missions required . Nonetheless , he continues to ask . One day , while Yossarian explains his pitiful circumstances , Doc Daneeka becomes the first in the novel to detail the structured frameworking of what is formally known as \" Catch-22 \" ; a circular argument that prevents any of the men from removing themselves from combat : There was only one catch and that was Catch-22 , which specified that a concern for one \\'s safety in the face of dangers that were real and immediate was the process of a rational mind . Orr was crazy and could be grounded . All he had to do was ask ; and as soon as he did , he would no longer be crazy and would have to fly more missions . Orr would be crazy to fly more missions and sane if he did n\\'t , but if he was sane he had to fly them . If he flew them he was crazy and did n\\'t have to ; but if he did n\\'t want to he was sane and had to . Yossarian was moved very deeply by the absolute simplicity of this clause of Catch-22 and let out a respectful whistle . \" That \\'s some catch , that Catch-22 , \" he [ Yossarian ] observed . \" It \\'s the best there is , \" Doc Daneeka agreed . \" Death \" One of his requisites of being an Air Corps doctor includes logging four hours per month of flight time in order to earn his flight pay . Since Doc Daneeka experiences fears of flight , he gets Yossarian to convince McWatt to add his name to his flight roster so that his hours are recorded , yet he does not need to leave the ground . While McWatt performs a training flight , he flies too low , killing Kid Sampson on the raft . Because of his grief , McWatt immediately flies into a mountain and commits suicide . Since McWatt \\'s flight roster included Doc Daneeka \\'s name , the military blindly assumes and pronounces that Doc Daneeka also died on the flight . The irony , that Doc Daneeka was standing next to the Sergeant Knight who affirmed this tragedy , is further enforced when Doc Daneeka continues to argue that he did not die . Mrs Daneeka Corporal Whitcomb develops the idea of writing and sending home form letters of condolence from Colonel Cathcart to those who died or went missing in combat . To cover all circumstances , the letter reads as a vague letter that could imply any type of death of any form of relative . At home , Mrs Daneeka receives one of these form letters that her husband has died in combat . She later receives a check from his GI insurance for $ 250 to finance his funeral . She then continues to receive donations and other insurances that Doc Daneeka paid for . As the proceedings continue to accumulate , she later appears to be pleased that her husband is dead . Doc Daneeka , enraged with the thickheadedness of the military , writes home two letters to his wife , Mrs Daneeka , addressed by himself . His wife feels uncertain after acquiring the first and asks if it is possible the military made a mistake , but is assured that the letter is simply the work of a \" sadistic and psychotic forger \" . Doc Daneeka futilely composes his second letter which she now believes to be a hoax . The book makes note that she and her children move to a new place ; she leaves no forwarding address , and no further reference of her existence throughout the rest of the story . Doc Daneeka \\'s last appearance in the story is in his tent with Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat , who is about to go up to the hospital to die of pneumonia . His last speech implies that he has accepted that he is bureaucratically a dead man : ‘ He ’ s dead , ’ Chief White Halfoat gloated , with a horse laugh entangled in phlegm . ‘ That ’ s really funny . ’ ‘ I don ’ t even draw my pay any more . ’ ‘ That ’ s really funny , ’ Chief White Halfoat repeated . ‘ All this time he ’ s been insulting my liver , and look what happened to him . He ’ s dead . Killed by his own greed . ’ That ’ s not what killed me , ’ Doc Daneeka observed in a voice that was calm and flat . ‘ There ’ s nothing wrong with greed . It ’ s all that lousy Dr . Stubbs ’ fault , getting Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn stirred up against flight surgeons . He ’ s going to give the medical profession a bad name by standing up for principle . If he ’ s not careful , he ’ ll be black-balled by his state medical association and kept out of the hospitals . ’ Yossarian and Chief White Halfoat ignore him , acting as if he is not there . Doc Daneeka disappears from the story at this point . Major themes Bureaucracy Doc Daneeka \\'s bureaucratic death parallels one of the main themes of the book that the bureaucratic system holds an impersonal attitude toward those who do not hold power in the higher echelons of the military branch ( colonels and generals ) . There is major irony in his death . The government goes so far to shield the military through political correctness on paper trails as to ignore the blatant , visual proof that Doc Daneeka did not die . Medical Ethics Catch-22 Greed Film portraits Doc Daneeka was portrayed by Jack Gilford in the 1970 film adaptation of the novel directed by Mike Nichols . Grant Heslov played the character in the 2019 miniseries . The miniseries diminishes his role . While he still is the one who informs Yossarian about Catch-22 , he is not mistaken for being dead and actually does try to help him out in getting sent home , though this fails .

References Municipalities of the canton of Vaud Ski areas and resorts in Switzerland Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Vaud', 'Kafir ( ; plural , or ; feminine ; feminine plural or ) is an Arabic term which , in the Islamic tradition , refers to a person who disbelieves in God as per Islam , or denies his authority , or rejects the tenets of Islam . The term is often translated as \" infidel \" , \" pagan \" , \" rejector \" , \" denier \" , \" disbeliever \" , \" unbeliever \" , \" nonbeliever \" . The term is used in different ways in the Quran , with the most fundamental sense being \" ungrateful \" ( toward God ) . Kufr means unbelief , \" to be thankless \" , \" to be faithless \" , or \" ingratitude \" . Its opposite is īmān or faith . Kafir is sometimes used interchangeably with mushrik ( , those who practice polytheism ) , another type of religious wrongdoer mentioned frequently in the Quran and other Islamic works . ( Other , sometimes overlapping Quranic terms for wrong doers are ẓallām ( villain , oppressor ) and fāsiq ( sinner , fornicator ) . ) Historically , while Islamic scholars agreed that a polytheist/mushrik is a kafir , they sometimes disagreed on the propriety of applying the term to Muslims who committed a grave sin or to the People of the Book . The Quran distinguishes between mushrikun and People of the Book , reserving the former term for idol worshipers , although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of shirk . In modern times , kafir is sometimes applied towards self-professed Muslims particularly by members of Islamist movements . The act of declaring another self-professed Muslim a kafir is known as takfir , a practice that has been condemned but also employed in theological and political polemics over the centuries . Dhimmi or Mu\\'ahid is a historical term for non-Muslims living in an Islamic state with legal protection . Dhimmi were exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims if they paid the poll tax ( jizya ) but were otherwise equal under the laws of property , contract , and obligation . Jews and Christians were required to pay the jizyah while pagans were required to either accept Islam or die . A person who denies the existence of a creator might be called a dahri . Etymology The word is the active participle of the verb كَفَرَ kafara , from root ك-ف-ر K-F-R . As a pre-Islamic term it described farmers burying seeds in the ground . One of its applications in the Quran has also the same meaning as farmer . Since farmers cover the seeds with soil while planting , the word implies a person who hides or covers . Ideologically , it implies a person who hides or covers the truth . Poets personify the darkness of night as kâfir , perhaps as a survival of pre-Islamic religious or mythological usage . The noun for disbelief , \" blasphemy \" , \" impiety \" rather than the person who disbelieves , is kufr . Usage The practice of declaring another Muslim as a kafir is takfir . Kufr ( unbelief ) and shirk ( idolatry ) are used throughout the Quran and sometimes used interchangeably by Muslims . According to Salafist scholars , Kufr is the \" denial of the Truth \" ( truth in the form of articles of faith in Islam ) , and shirk means devoting \" acts of worship to anything beside God \" or \" the worship of idols and other created beings \" . So a mushrik may worship other things while also \" acknowledging God \" . In the Quran The distinction between those who believe in Islam and those who do not is an essential one in the Quran . Kafir , and its plural kuffaar , is used directly 134 times in Quran , its verbal noun \" kufr \" is used 37 times , and the verbal cognates of kafir are used about 250 times . By extension of the basic meaning of the root , \" to cover \" , the term is used in the Quran in the senses of ignore/fail to acknowledge and to spurn/be ungrateful . The meaning of \" disbelief \" , which has come to be regarded as primary , retains all of these connotations in the Quranic usage . In the Quranic discourse , the term typifies all things that are unacceptable and offensive to God . Whereby it is not necessary to deny the existence of God , but it suffices to deviate from his will as seen in a dialogue between God and Iblis , the latter called a kafir . According to Al-Damiri ( 1341–1405 ) it is neither denying God , nor the act of disobedience alone , but Iblis \\' attitude ( claiming that God \\'s command is unjust ) , which makes him a kafir . The most fundamental sense of kufr in the Quran is \" ingratitude \" , the willful refusal to acknowledge or appreciate the benefits that God bestows on humankind , including clear signs and revealed scriptures . According to the E . J . Brill \\'s First Encyclopaedia of Islam , 1913–1936 , Volume 4 , the term first applied in the Quran to unbelieving Meccans , who endeavoured \" to refute and revile the Prophet \" . A waiting attitude towards the kafir was recommended at first for Muslims ; later , Muslims were ordered to keep apart from unbelievers and defend themselves against their attacks and even take the offensive . Most passages in the Quran referring to unbelievers in general talk about their fate on the day of judgement and destination in hell . According to scholar Marilyn Waldman , as the Quran \" progresses \" ( as the reader goes from the verses revealed first to later ones ) , the meaning behind the term kafir does not change but \" progresses \" , i.e . \" accumulates meaning over time \" . As the Islamic Prophet Muhammad \\'s views of his opponents change , his use of kafir \" undergoes a development \" . Kafir moves from being one description of Muhammad \\'s opponents to the primary one . Later in the Quran , kafir becomes more and more connected with shirk . Finally , towards the end of the Quran , kafir begins to also signify the group of people to be fought by the mu\\'minīn ( believers ) . Types of unbelievers People of the Book The status of the Ahl al-Kitab ( People of the Book ) , particularly Jews and Christians , with respect to the Islamic notions of unbelief is disputed . Charles Adams writes that the Quran reproaches the People of the Book with kufr for rejecting Muhammad \\'s message when they should have been the first to accept it as possessors of earlier revelations , and singles out Christians for disregarding the evidence of God \\'s unity . The Quranic verse 5:73 ( \" Certainly they disbelieve [ kafara ] who say : God is the third of three \" ) , among other verses , has been traditionally understood in Islam as rejection of the Christian Trinity doctrine , though modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations . Other Quranic verses strongly deny the deity of Jesus Christ , son of Mary and reproach the people who treat Jesus as equal with God as disbelievers who will have strayed from the path of God which would result in the entrance of hellfire . While the Quran does not recognize the attribute of Jesus as the Son of God or God himself , it respects Jesus as a prophet and messenger of God sent to children of Israel . Some Muslim thinkers such as Mohamed Talbi have viewed the most extreme Quranic presentations of the dogmas of the Trinity and divinity of Jesus ( 5:19 , 5:75-76 , 5:119 ) as non-Christian formulas that were rejected by the Church . On the other hand , modern scholarship has suggested alternative interpretations of verse Q.5:73 . Cyril Glasse criticizes the use of kafirun [ pl . of kafir ] to describe Christians as \" loose usage \" . According to the Encyclopedia of Islam , in traditional Islamic jurisprudence , ahl al-kitab are \" usually regarded more leniently than other kuffar [ pl . of kafir ] \" and \" in theory \" a Muslim commits a punishable offense if he says to a Jew or a Christian : \" Thou unbeliever \" . ( Charles Adams and A . Kevin Reinhart also write that \" later thinkers \" in Islam distinguished between ahl al-kitab and the polytheists/mushrikīn ) . Historically , People of the Book permanently residing under Islamic rule were entitled to a special status known as dhimmi , while those visiting Muslim lands received a different status known as musta\\'min . Mushrikun Mushrikun ( pl . of mushrik ) are those who practice shirk , which literally means \" association \" and refers to accepting other gods and divinities alongside the god of the Muslims – Allah ( as God \\'s \" associates \" ) . The term is often translated as polytheism . The Quran distinguishes between mushrikun and People of the Book , reserving the former term for idol worshipers , although some classical commentators considered Christian doctrine to be a form of shirk . Shirk is held to be the worst form of disbelief , and it is identified in the Quran as the only sin that God will not pardon ( 4:48 , 4:116 ) . Accusations of shirk have been common in religious polemics within Islam . Thus , in the early Islamic debates on free will and theodicy , Sunni theologians charged their Mu\\'tazila adversaries with shirk , accusing them of attributing to man creative powers comparable to those of God in both originating and executing his own actions . Mu\\'tazila theologians , in turn , charged the Sunnis with shirk on the grounds that under their doctrine a voluntary human act would result from an \" association \" between God , who creates the act , and the individual who appropriates it by carrying it out . In classical jurisprudence , Islamic religious tolerance applied only to the People of the Book , while mushrikun , based on the Sword Verse , faced a choice between conversion to Islam and fight to the death , which may be substituted by enslavement . In practice , the designation of People of the Book and the dhimmi status was extended even to non-monotheistic religions of conquered peoples , such as Hinduism . Following destruction of major Hindu temples during the Muslim conquests in South Asia , Hindus and Muslims on the subcontinent came to share a number of popular religious practices and beliefs , such as veneration of Sufi saints and worship at Sufi dargahs , although Hindus may worship at Hindu shrines also . In the 18th century , followers of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab ( aka Wahhabis ) believed \" kufr or shirk \" was found in the Muslim community itself , especially in \" the practice of popular religion \" : While ibn Abd al-Wahhab and Wahhābīs was/were \" the best-known premodern \" revivalist and \" sectarian movement \" of that era , other revivalists included Shah Ismail Dehlvi and Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi , leaders of the Mujāhidīn movement on the North-West frontier of India in the early nineteenth century . Sinners Whether a Muslim could commit a sin great enough to become a kafir was disputed by jurists in the early centuries of Islam . The most tolerant view ( that of the Murji\\'ah ) was that even those who had committed a major sin ( kabira ) were still believers and \" their fate was left to God \" . The most strict view ( that of Kharidji Ibadis , descended from the Kharijites ) was that every Muslim who dies having not repented of his sins was considered a kafir . In between these two positions , the Mu\\'tazila believed that there was a status between believer and unbeliever called \" rejected \" or fasiq . Takfir The Kharijites view that the self-proclaimed Muslim who had sinned and \" failed to repent had ipso facto excluded himself from the community , and was hence a kafir \" ( a practice known as takfir ) was considered so extreme by the Sunni majority that they in turn declared the Kharijites to be kuffar , following the hadith that declared , \" If a Muslim charges a fellow Muslim with kufr , he is himself a kafir if the accusation should prove untrue \" . Nevertheless , in Islamic theological polemics kafir was \" a frequent term for the Muslim protagonist \" holding the opposite view , according to Brill \\'s Islamic Encyclopedia . Present-day Muslims who make interpretations that differ from what others believe are declared kafirs ; fatwas ( edicts by Islamic religious leaders ) are issued ordering Muslims to kill them , and some such people have been killed also . Murtad Another group that are \" distinguished from the mass of kafirun \" are the murtad , or apostate ex-Muslims , who are considered renegades and traitors . Their traditional punishment is death , even , according to some scholars , if they recant their abandonment of Islam . Mu\\'ahid / dhimmi Dhimmi are non-Muslims living under the protection of an Islamic state . Dhimmi were exempt from certain duties assigned specifically to Muslims if they paid the poll tax ( jizya ) but were otherwise equal under the laws of property , contract , and obligation . Jews and Christians were required to pay the jizyah while pagans were required to either accept Islam or die . Upon payment of the tax ( jizya ) , the dhimmi would receive a receipt of payment , either in the form of a piece of paper or parchment or as a seal humiliatingly placed upon their neck , and was thereafter compelled to carry this receipt wherever he went within the realms of Islam . Failure to produce an up-to-date jizya receipt on the request of a Muslim could result in death or forced conversion to Islam of the dhimmi in question . Types of disbelief Various types of unbelief recognized by legal scholars include : kufr bi-l-qawl ( verbally expressed unbelief ) kufr bi-l-fi \\' l ( unbelief expressed through action ) kufr bi-l-i\\'tiqad ( unbelief of convictions ) kufr akbar ( major unbelief ) kufr asghar ( minor unbelief ) takfir \\'amm ( general charge of unbelief , i.e . charged against a community like ahmadiyya takfir al-mu\\'ayyan ( charge of unbelief against a particular individual ) takfir al-\\'awamm ( charge of unbelief against \" rank and file Muslims \" for example following taqlid . takfir al-mutlaq ( category covers general statements such as \\'whoever says X or does Y is guilty of unbelief \\' ) kufr asli ( original unbelief of non-Muslims , those born to non-Muslim family ) kufr tari ( acquired unbelief of formerly observant Muslims , i.e . apostates ) Iman Muslim belief/doctrine is often summarized in \" the Six Articles of Faith \" , ( the first five are mentioned together in the Qur\\'an 2:285 ) . God His angels His Messengers His Revealed Books , The Day of Resurrection Al-Qadar , Divine Preordainments , i.e . whatever God has ordained must come to pass According to the Salafi scholar Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali , \" kufr is basically disbelief in any of the articles of faith . He also lists several different types of major disbelief , ( disbelief so severe it excludes those who practice it completely from the fold of Islam ) : Kufr-at-Takdhib : disbelief in divine truth or the denial of any of the articles of Faith ( quran 39:32 ) Kufr-al-iba wat-takabbur ma\\'at-Tasdiq : refusing to submit to God \\'s Commandments after conviction of their truth ( quran 2:34 ) Kufr-ash-Shakk waz-Zann : doubting or lacking conviction in the six articles of Faith . ( quran 18:35–38 ) Kufr-al-I\\'raadh : turning away from the truth knowingly or deviating from the obvious signs which God has revealed . ( quran 46:3 ) Kufr-an-Nifaaq : hypocritical disbelief ( quran 63:2–3 ) Minor disbelief or Kufran-Ni\\'mah indicates \" ungratefulness of God \\'s Blessings or Favours \" . According to another source , a paraphrase of the Tafsir by Ibn Kathir , there are eight kinds of Al-Kufr al-Akbar ( major unbelief ) , some are the same as those described by Al-Hilali ( Kufr-al-I\\'rad , Kufr-an-Nifaaq ) and some different . Kufrul-\\'Inaad : Disbelief out of stubbornness . This applies to someone who knows the Truth and admits to knowing the Truth , and knowing it with his tongue , but refuses to accept it and refrains from making a declaration . God says : Throw into Hell every stubborn disbeliever . Kufrul-Inkaar : Disbelief out of denial . This applies to someone who denies with both heart and tongue . God says : They recognize the favors of God , yet they deny them . Most of them are disbelievers . Kufrul-Juhood : Disbelief out of rejection . This applies to someone who acknowledges the truth in his heart , but rejects it with his tongue . This type of kufr is applicable to those who call themselves Muslims but who reject any necessary and accepted norms of Islam such as Salaat and Zakat . God says : They denied them ( our signs ) even though their hearts believed in them , out of spite and arrogance . Kufrul-Nifaaq : Disbelief out of hypocrisy . This applies to someone who pretends to be a believer but conceals his disbelief . Such a person is called a munafiq or hypocrite . God says : Verily the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of Hell . You will find no one to help them . Kufrul-Kurh : Disbelief out of detesting any of God \\'s commands . God says : Perdition ( destruction ) has been consigned to those who disbelieve and He will render their actions void . This is because they are averse to that which God has revealed so He has made their actions fruitless . Kufrul-Istihzaha : Disbelief due to mockery and derision . God says : Say : Was it at God , His signs and His apostles that you were mocking ? Make no excuses . You have disbelieved after you have believed . Kufrul-I\\'raadh : Disbelief due to avoidance . This applies to those who turn away and avoid the truth . God says : And who is more unjust than he who is reminded of his Lord \\'s signs but then turns away from them . Then he forgets what he has sent forward ( for the Day of Judgement ) . Kufrul-Istibdaal : Disbelief because of trying to substitute God \\'s Laws with man-made laws . God says : Or have they partners with God who have instituted for them a religion that God has not allowed . God says : Say not concerning that which your tongues put forth falsely ( that ) is lawful and this is forbidden so as to invent a lie against God . Verily , those who invent a lie against God will never prosper . Ignorance In Islam , jahiliyyah ( \" ignorance \" ) refers to the time of Arabia before Islam . History of usage In proper sense When the Islamic empire expanded , the word \" kafir \" was used broadly for all pagans and anyone who disbelieved in Islam . Historically , the attitude toward unbelievers in Islam was determined more by socio-political conditions than by religious doctrine . A tolerance toward unbelievers \" impossible to imagine in contemporary Christendom \" prevailed even to the time of the Crusades , particularly with respect to the People of the Book . However , due to animosity towards Franks , the term kafir developed into a term of abuse . During the Mahdist War , the Mahdist State used the term kuffar against Ottoman Turks , and the Turks themselves used the term kuffar towards Persians during the Ottoman-Safavid wars . In modern Muslim popular imagination , the dajjal ( antichrist-like figure ) will have k-f-r written on his forehead . However , there was extensive religious violence in India between Muslims and non-Muslims during the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire ( before the political decline of Islam ) . In their memoirs on Muslim invasions , enslavement and plunder of this period , many Muslim historians in South Asia used the term Kafir for Hindus , Buddhists , Sikhs and Jains . Raziuddin Aquil states that \" non-Muslims were often condemned as kafirs , in medieval Indian Islamic literature , including court chronicles , Sufi texts and literary compositions \" and fatwas were issued that justified persecution of the non-Muslims . Relations between Jews and Muslims in the Arab world and use of the word \" kafir \" were equally as complex , and over the last century , issues regarding \" kafir \" have arisen over the conflict in Israel and Palestine . Calling the Jews of Israel , \" the usurping kafir \" , Yasser Arafat turned on the Muslim resistance and \" allegedly set a precedent for preventing Muslims from mobilizing against \\'aggressor disbelievers \\' in other Muslim lands , and enabled \\'the cowardly , alien kafir \\' to achieve new levels of intervention in Muslim affairs . \" In 2019 , Nahdlatul Ulama , the largest independent Islamic organization in the world based in Indonesia , issued a proclamation urging Muslims to refrain from using the word kafir to refer to non-Muslims , as the term is both offensive and perceived to be \" theologically violent \" . Muhammad \\'s parents A hadith in which Muhammad states that his father , Abdullah ibn Abd al-Muttalib , was in Hell , has become a source of disagreement among Islamic scholars about the status of Muhammad \\'s parents . Over the centuries , Sunni scholars have dismissed this hadith despite its appearance in the authoritative Sahih Muslim collection . It passed through a single chain of transmission for three generations , so that its authenticity was not considered certain enough to supersede a theological consensus which stated that people who died before a prophetic message reached them—as Muhammad \\'s father had done—could not be held accountable for not embracing it . Shia Muslim scholars likewise consider Muhammad \\'s parents to be in Paradise . In contrast , the Salafi website IslamQA.info , founded by the Saudi Arabian Salafi scholar Muhammad Al-Munajjid , argues that Islamic tradition teaches that Muhammad \\'s parents were kuffār ( \" disbelievers \" ) who are in Hell . Other uses By the 15th century , the word Kaffir was used by Muslims in Africa to refer to the non-Muslim African natives . Many of those kufari were enslaved and sold by their Muslims captors to European and Asian merchants , mainly from Portugal , who by that time had established trading outposts along the coast of West Africa . These European traders adopted that Arabic word and its derivatives . Some of the earliest records of European usage of the word can be found in The Principal Navigations , Voyages , Traffiques and Discoveries of the English Nation ( 1589 ) by Richard Hakluyt . In volume 4 , Hakluyt writes : \" calling them Cafars and Gawars , which is , infidels or disbelievers \" . Volume 9 refers to the slaves ( slaves called Cafari ) and inhabitants of Ethiopia ( and they use to go in small shippes , and trade with the Cafars ) by two different but similar names . The word is also used in reference to the coast of Africa as land of Cafraria . The 16th century explorer Leo Africanus described the Cafri as \" negroes \" , and one of five principal population groups in Africa . He identified their geographical heartland as being located in remote southern Africa , an area which he designated as Cafraria . By the late 19th century the word was in use in English-language newspapers and books . One of the Union-Castle Line ships operating off the South African coast was named SS Kafir . In the early twentieth century , in his book The Essential Kafir , Dudley Kidd writes that the word kafir had come to be used for all dark-skinned South African tribes . Thus , in many parts of South Africa , kafir became synonymous with the word \" native \" . Currently in South Africa , however , the word kaffir is regarded as a racial slur , applied pejoratively or offensively to blacks . The song \" Kafir \" by American technical death metal band Nile from their sixth album Those Whom the Gods Detest uses as subject matter the violent attitudes that Muslim extremists have toward kafirs . The Nuristani people were formerly known as Kaffirs of Kafiristan before the Afghan Islamization of the region . The Kalash people located in the Hindu Kush mountain range south west of Chitral are known as kafirs by the Muslim population of Chitral . In modern Spanish , the word cafre , derived from the Arabic kafir by way of Portuguese , also means \" uncouth \" or \" savage \" .

Citizens of Liestal participated in the Burgundian Wars in 1476 and 1477 against Charles the Bold .

In 1789 , the town enthusiastically hailed the French call for freedom and equality . It celebrated Napoleon , when he traveled through town in 1797 . After his fall , the earlier subjection to Basel was re-established . The French July Revolution of 1830 also caused upheaval in Liestal .

Etymology The word nagual derives from the Nahuatl word nahuālli , an indigenous religious practitioner , identified by the Spanish as a \\'magician \\' . In English , the word is often translated as \" transforming witch , \" but translations without negative connotations include \" transforming trickster \" or \" shape shifter . \" Beliefs Naguals use their powers for good or evil according to their personality . The general concept of nagualism is pan-Mesoamerican . Nagualism is linked with pre-Columbian shamanistic practices through Pre-classic Olmec depictions that are interpreted as human beings transforming themselves into animals . The system is linked with the Mesoamerican calendrical system , used for divination rituals . Birth dates often determine if a person can become a nagual . Mesoamerican belief in tonalism , wherein every person has an animal counterpart to which his life force is linked , is drawn upon by nagualism . The nagual trait is acquired at birth , along with other characteristics associated with a person \\'s birth day . Each day is associated with an animal that has strong and weak aspects . A person born on \" Dog Day \" would have both strong and weak \\'dog \\' aspects . In Nahuatl the word tonalli is used to refer both to a day and to the animal associated with that day . The nagual is considered different ; where the tonal is the day spirit itself , the nagual is the familiar spirit of the day . It is probable that the tonal represents the daytime aspect and the nagual the nighttime aspect of the tonalli , \\'the things of the day \\' . Practitioners of powerful magic were normally born on days related to animals with a strong or harmful aspect . They would have specific tonals such as the jaguar or puma . In Aztec mythology the god Tezcatlipoca was the protector of nagualism , because his tonal was the jaguar and he governed the distribution of wealth . In modern rural Mexico , nagual is sometimes synonymous with brujo ( \" wizard \" ) ; one who is able to shapeshift into an animal at night ( normally into a dog , owl , bat , wolf or turkey ) , drink blood from human victims , steal property , cause disease , and the like . In some indigenous communities the nagual is integrated into the religious hierarchy . The community knows who is a nagual , tolerating , fearing and respecting them . Nagualli are hired to remove curses cast by other nagualli . In other communities the accusation of nagualism may result in violent attacks on the accused by the community . The Western study of nagualism was initiated by archaeologist , linguist , and ethnologist Daniel Garrison Brinton who published Nagualism : A Study in Native-American Folklore and History , which chronicled historical interpretations of the word and those who practiced nagualism in Mexico in 1894 . He identified various beliefs associated with nagualism in modern Mexican communities such as the Mixe , the Nahua , the Zapotec and the Mixtec . Subsequently , many studies have described nagualism in different Mesoamerican cultures such as the Zoques and the Jakaltek , K\\'iche \\' , Q\\'eqchi \\' , and Tzeltal Maya . Among the Jacaltek , naguals reinforce indigenism by punishing those who collaborate with non-indigenous Ladinos . In 1955 , Gustavo Correa suggested nagualism is not pre-Columbian , arguing that it was wholly imported from Europe , where he compared it to the medieval belief in werewolves . However , shapeshifting folklore is not limited to Europe , nor to the Middle Ages ; for example , some of Earth \\'s oldest literature , the Bronze Age Eastern Semitic Epic of Gilgamesh , and East Asia \\'s Huli Jing ( origin of this folklore is of unknown date , but eighteenth century at the latest ) , contain shapeshifters . The werewolf ( lycanthropy ) is neither the only nor the earliest form of folklorical therianthropy ( shapeshifting from human to animal , or vice versa ) . Kaplan concludes that , in Oaxaca , the belief in naguals as evil , shape shifting witches is common in both indigenous and Mestizo populations . According to Kaplan , the belief in animal spirit companions is exclusively indigenous . This is certain for some groups and communities , but for others , such as the Mixes , Chinantecos , Triquis , or Tacuates , those who can control their nahual or alterego are protectors of the people , natural resources and culture of the community , highly revered , but also feared . The nagual was popularized in shamanism books by author Carlos Castaneda . He defined the nagual as , \" the teacher who becomes the gateway , the doorway , the intermediate between the world of the \\'seeker \\' or apprentice , and the world of the spirit . \" See also References Bibliography Further reading Aztec legendary creatures Aztec mythology and religion Belizean folklore Guatemalan folklore Latin American folklore Maya legendary creatures Maya mythology and religion Mexican folklore Shamanism of the Americas Therianthropy American witchcraft Werewolves', 'The Death Eaters are characters featured in the Harry Potter series of novels and films . They are a terrorist group of wizards and witches , led by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort , who seek to purify the wizarding community by eliminating wizards and witches born to non-magical parents . They attempt to create a new order within the Ministry of Magic by spreading fear through the wizarding community and murdering those who speak out against them . Their primary opposition is the Order of the Phoenix . Death Eaters recognise one another by the Dark Mark , a sigil branded on each of their left forearms that allows Voldemort to summon any of them instantly . Their typical attire includes black hooded robes and masks . The Death Eaters as a group first appeared in the novel Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , although individual members of the group , such as Severus Snape , Lucius Malfoy , and Peter Pettigrew had appeared in earlier books in the series . The group had also been mentioned indirectly in Harry Potter and the Philosopher \\'s Stone and in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , when followers of Voldemort were mentioned . They were mentioned the first time directly in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . Synopsis Pre-Harry Potter The Death Eaters first existed over 11 years before the events of the books , torturing and murdering Muggles ( people without magical abilities ) , as well as anyone who opposed them , including wizards who support Muggles ( such as the Weasley family ) . Around 10 years after the Death Eaters first surfaced , a Seer named Sybill Trelawney made a prophecy about a boy who would have the power to defeat Voldemort forever . The prophecy could have referred to two different boys , Harry Potter or Neville Longbottom ; however , Voldemort chose Harry as said in the prophecy , that \" the Dark Lord would mark him as his equal \" . As Voldemort was a half-blood , he chose his \" equal \" , Harry , whose mother was a Muggle-born witch , instead of Neville , who came from a long line of pure-blooded wizards . Acting on information from James and Lily Potter \\'s Secret-Keeper Peter Pettigrew , Voldemort attempted to complete the prophecy and kill his infant rival . Due to Harry \\'s mother \\'s sacrifice to save her son , Voldemort \\'s deadly curse rebounded off Harry and disembodied Voldemort . With Voldemort vanquished after failing to kill Harry Potter , the Death Eaters largely disbanded and vanished . The Ministry rounded many of them up and imprisoned them in the Wizarding prison Azkaban , but some eluded justice by claiming they were bewitched by the Imperius Curse ( it is implied that Lucius Malfoy did so ) or by turning in other Death Eaters , as Igor Karkaroff did ; Harry witnesses Karkaroff \\'s testimony against former Death Eaters in Albus Dumbledore \\'s Pensieve during the course of the series . It appears that very few Death Eaters stood for their fallen master and proudly went to Azkaban for him ( like Bellatrix Lestrange ) , since , in the sixth book , Snape states that if Voldemort had refused to welcome back all those who turned their backs on him when he fell , then he would have very few followers . The Lestranges are the only Death Eaters known to have willingly sacrificed their freedom for Voldemort . Voldemort takes notice of this and claims that they will be rewarded above all others for their great loyalty . Snape \\'s position as a Death Eater is unique – during the books he convinces all ( with the exception of Dumbledore ) that he is working for whichever side requires it at that time . This is due to his skill at Occlumency allowing him to disguise his true motive – a love for Lily Potter – from Voldemort . Re-emergence Early in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire a group of Death Eaters rallied after the Quidditch World Cup . They gathered to form a large spectacle and disturbance which spread instant chaos and fear amongst the wizarding community . Their appearance alone created hysteria , and their numbers grew while they tortured Muggles and Muggle-borns on site . It concluded when the Dark Mark was produced in the sky by Barty Crouch Jr , frightening Death Eaters and Ministry officials alike . Voldemort , having regained his full strength at the end of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , summoned his followers to him by touching Peter Pettigrew \\'s Dark Mark . Except for Severus Snape ( who was staying at Hogwarts to \" maintain his cover \" ) and those dead , imprisoned , or afraid to return , the majority returned to his service as Voldemort began his second attempt to claim all power . Voldemort states at his rebirth , \" And here we have six missing Death Eaters ... three dead in my service . One , too cowardly to return ... he will pay . One , who I believe has left me forever ... he will be killed , of course ... and one , who remains my most faithful servant , and who has already reentered my service . \" Based on mentions and later happenings in the books , it can be deduced that the one \" too cowardly to return \" is Igor Karkaroff . The one \" who I believe has left me forever \" is Severus Snape , who returns two hours later to explain his absence and convince Voldemort that he is a spy for him . The \" most faithful servant \" is Barty Crouch Jr. , who has already been in place at Hogwarts working for Voldemort . The three dead include Evan Rosier , Wilkes and Regulus Black . The Minister for Magic ( Cornelius Fudge ) deluded himself into believing that Voldemort could not have come back and that it was all a lie cooked up by Dumbledore , who Fudge believed had designs on his political office . The Death Eaters use this tactical advantage throughout Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix to maintain their secrecy . Because of the Ministry \\'s refusal to remove the Dementors from Azkaban , which Dumbledore advised immediately following Voldemort \\'s return , the Death Eaters recruited the Dementors to their cause and made similar progress with the giants ; the Dementors \\' revolt against the Ministry of Magic also allowed the Death Eaters to bolster their ranks with the mass break-out of several imprisoned Death Eaters , including Bellatrix Lestrange . In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Voldemort sent a group of Death Eaters , led by Lucius Malfoy , into the Department of Mysteries , where he expected them to secure a prophecy of vital importance to him : having originally attacked Harry Potter based upon a partial recounting of it , he now wanted to hear the full version to better , or even fully , understand the connection between Harry and himself . The raid on the Department failed , however ; Harry Potter and his friends delayed the Death Eaters and kept the prophecy out of their hands , finally destroying it , and were eventually aided by Albus Dumbledore and the Order of the Phoenix . Dumbledore captured all of the Death Eaters except for Bellatrix , sending Voldemort and her fleeing after a fierce duel with the former , and ending the Death Eaters \\' enjoyed secrecy . Lucius , who had been important both to the Death Eaters and within the Ministry , was captured and imprisoned . However , the Death Eaters regrouped , assassinating and kidnapping important wizards , killing Muggles , and in general spreading terror and chaos through the Wizarding world . Soon after Lucius \\' capture , his son Draco Malfoy is given the task of killing Albus Dumbledore , although this task is eventually performed by Severus Snape . Towards the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , the Death Eaters attacked Hogwarts for the first time , leading to the death of Albus Dumbledore and injuries to several of the school \\'s defenders . A second , more deadly attack near the conclusion of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows resulted in over 50 deaths , including Voldemort , who died when the Killing Curse he threw at Harry rebounded on him . Voldemort \\'s death signalled the end of all Death Eaters . Ideology Voldemort \\'s Death Eaters practise illegal and dangerous spells known as dark magic . They follow a racist ideology that places pure-blooded wizards at the top of a racial hierarchy , above all other magical or non-magical people and entities . They believe wizards are , as a genealogy book within the story phrases it , \" Nature \\'s Nobility \" ; other magical creatures and the non-magical are inferior and should be subjugated . Within the wizarding community , only those who are born to wizard parents are worthy of magical power , despite the fact that parentage does not in fact determine who possess such powers . They categorise wizards according to blood purity ; \" pure bloods \" ( those with only wizards as parents ) out-rank \" half-bloods \" ( mixed parentage ) and \" mudbloods \" , a derogatory name for those born to non-magical parents ( Muggles ) . Death Eaters have also attacked pure-bloods who oppose them . Examples of this are pure-blooded members of the Order of the Phoenix such as Sirius Black , the Prewett brothers , who were murdered because of their loyalties , and the entire Weasley family . Such people are often called \" blood traitors \" by those who subscribe to Death Eater ideologies . In reality , the idea of blood purity is a misnomer – Voldemort himself is a half-blood – and it is unlikely that all of them could be pure-bloods , as very few , if any , such people could exist given the small gene pool . In Half-Blood Prince , Rowling depicts the Gaunts as a family who are obsessed with their ancestry and driven to inbreeding to preserve its integrity . Rowling has stated on her website that there are no true pure-blood families left but that those who call themselves such simply strike Muggles , Squibs , and half-bloods from their family records . On the other hand , \" in rare circumstances \" a Muggle-born wizard can become a Death Eater . They are also not above recruiting creatures they deem inferior , as proven by werewolf Fenrir Greyback and the giant clan from continental Europe , as long as they help further the larger Death Eater agenda . The Death Eaters seek complete power and control over the entire Wizarding world , wishing to restrict leadership to a small band of pure-bloods . The Death Eaters not only seek the restoration of pure-blood rule over the Wizarding community , but also the eventual subjugation of the Muggle community under Wizarding rule . During their control over the Ministry of Magic , they severely persecuted Muggle-born wizards , sending them to Azkaban for life or feeding them to Dementors . Death Eaters and their crimes The following characters are Death Eaters identified by name during the series , and the crimes they committed . Notable Death Eaters Alecto and Amycus Carrow Alecto and Amycus Carrow are siblings who participate in the assault on Hogwarts at the end of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . Amycus is described as being squat and lumpy , with a lopsided leer and a wheezy giggle ; Alecto is described as a \" stocky little woman \" and shares her brother \\'s squatness and laugh . It is said that after Voldemort \\'s first downfall , they believed that he was gone forever . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Alecto and Amycus become \" teachers \" at Hogwarts , severely disciplining students who oppose Voldemort . Amycus teaches Defence Against the Dark Arts , but as Neville Longbottom puts it , it becomes just \" The Dark Arts \" in which students are forced to perform the Cruciatus Curse against students who have been assigned to detention . Alecto teaches Muggle Studies , which becomes a compulsory subject , and teaches students that Muggles are like animals . Right before the Battle of Hogwarts , Alecto waits in Ravenclaw Tower on Voldemort \\'s orders , preparing to capture Harry , but is stunned by Luna Lovegood after touching her Dark Mark to summon Voldemort . Amycus , after seeing what happened , tries to conspire with Minerva McGonagall who helped him into the room to offer some Ravenclaw students as sacrifices to Voldemort while planning to use the lie that Ravenclaws had ambushed Alecto and forced her to press her Dark Mark . McGonagall refuses and argues with Amycus , who spits in her face . Enraged at this , Harry casts the Cruciatus Curse , with such power that Amycus passes out . Later , McGonagall places the Imperius Curse on him , then binds him with his sister and places him inside a net . Ralph Ineson plays Amycus , and Suzie Toase appears as Alecto in the films , wherein they are reduced to non-speaking roles . In the second part of the final film , Snape deflects a spell from McGonagall which hits the Carrows , possibly to protect the students from their abuses and to show his allegiance to Dumbledore . Barty Crouch Jr Bartemius \" Barty \" Crouch , Junior was captured with Bellatrix Lestrange and Rodolphus Lestrange , who tortured Frank and Alice Longbottom , parents of Neville Longbottom , into insanity . His father , Barty Crouch Sr. , who headed the Department of Magical Law Enforcement at the time , sentenced him to life imprisonment in Azkaban . However , he later rescues his son as a favour to his dying wife . When they visit him in Azkaban , Mrs . Crouch used Polyjuice Potion to switch appearances with her son , enabling him to escape while she remains in his place . When she dies , she is buried under his identity . Crouch Jr . is nursed back to health by Winky , the family \\'s house-elf . To prevent him from returning to Voldemort \\'s service , Crouch Sr . controls his son with the Imperius Curse and keeps him hidden under an invisibility cloak . When Bertha Jorkins discovers the truth , the news reaches Voldemort , who rescues Crouch Jr . and puts Crouch Sr . under the Imperius Curse . Crouch Jr . then imprisons Alastor \" Mad-Eye \" Moody , a famous auror , and using Polyjuice Potion , assumes Moody \\'s appearance and position to infiltrate Hogwarts as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher . Despite not being a real teacher , Crouch Jr . does a fair job and the class learns vast amounts from him , including valuable knowledge related to the three \" unforgivable curses \" . Crouch Sr . escapes and , exhausted and delirious from the Imperius Curse , reaches Hogwarts to tell Dumbledore about Voldemort \\'s return ; but his loyal Death-Eater son murders him on the castle grounds , transfigures the body into a bone , and buries the bone in freshly turned earth in front of Hagrid \\'s cabin . The revived Triwizard Tournament is held at Hogwarts , and Voldemort tasks Crouch Jr . with making sure Harry wins . To do so , he puts Harry \\'s name in the Goblet of Fire , bewitches Viktor Krum to attack Cedric Diggory in the maze , and stuns Fleur Delacour . When Harry and Cedric simultaneously touch the Triwizard Cup , which is a portkey , it transports them to the graveyard in Little Hangleton , home of the Riddle family . There , after killing Cedric , Death Eater Peter Pettigrew uses Harry \\'s blood in a ritual that re-embodies Voldemort . The Dark Lord attempts to kill Harry , but with the help of the ghost-echoes from Voldemort \\'s wand , Harry escapes via the Portkey . When Harry reappears at Hogwarts , the still-disguised Crouch Jr . hopes to succeed where his master failed ; but Dumbledore , Snape , and McGonagall foil his plot . Under the effects of Veritaserum , he recounts his plan to them . Although he is closely guarded so he can later repeat his testimony , a Dementor acting as bodyguard to Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge attacks Crouch and sucks out his soul before anyone can stop it . Crouch lives bereft of his memories or sense of self . He is played by David Tennant in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . Antonin Dolohov Antonin Dolohov has a long , pale , and twisted face , with a name that suggests he is of Slavic descent . He is confirmed in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to be one of Voldemort \\'s first Death Eaters , being present at the Hog \\'s Head when Voldemort comes to Hogwarts to request a teaching position and hide the diadem Horcrux , c . 1956 . This makes him at least sixty years old at the time of the battle in the Department of Mysteries . Dolohov is one of the five Death Eaters who murder Gideon and Fabian Prewett ( Molly Weasley \\'s brothers ) . He also tortures many Muggles and opponents of Voldemort during the first war . Dolohov is imprisoned in Azkaban but escapes during the mass break-out . He participates in the battle of the Department of Mysteries , where he causes injury to Hermione , but is imprisoned again , and returns to Azkaban prison . He escapes once more some time before the events of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . He tracks Harry , Ron , and Hermione to a Muggle cafe after they use Voldemort \\'s name ( which had recently been made taboo ) . He and his companion Rowle are stunned , and have their memories erased by Hermione and then are punished by Voldemort . Dolohov participates in the Battle of Hogwarts , killing Remus Lupin , whom Aberforth Dumbledore last sees fighting with him . He is also seen dueling with Dean Thomas until Parvati Patil uses the Body-bind Curse on him . Dolohov and Yaxley are later sent to look for Harry , and they mistakenly thought the boy would not give himself up . When the battle recommences , Professor Flitwick finally defeats him . He is portrayed by Arben Bajraktaraj in the film adaptations of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 . Fenrir Greyback Fenrir Greyback is a werewolf who is involved with the Death Eaters . He works alongside Lord Voldemort because Lord Voldemort promises fairness to werewolves around the country . He does not carry the Dark Mark as he is not a Death Eater . He is known as the most savage werewolf ever to live and is greatly feared throughout the wizarding world . He positions himself close to his victims when the moon is almost full . To fulfil his agenda of creating as many werewolves as possible , Greyback has infected scores of people including the young Remus Lupin , when Lupin \\'s father had angered Greyback . Greyback is known for targeting young children . Unlike most werewolves , Greyback thirsts for blood even in his human form . In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , Greyback first appears on the night of Dumbledore \\'s death , when he attacks Harry and badly scars Bill Weasley . Although Greyback does not transmit his lycanthropy because he was in human form at the time , Bill is subsequently shown to display a preference for very rare meat . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Greyback leads a Snatcher gang – Dark wizards looking for Muggle-borns and \" Undesirables \" in exchange for gold . When Harry accidentally uses Voldemort \\'s name after it has been made taboo , Greyback is alerted and his gang attacks their camp . Harry , Ron , and Hermione are kidnapped by the Snatchers and are taken to Malfoy Manor . Bellatrix Lestrange promises Hermione to Greyback in return for his services , but the prisoners fight their way out and escape , Greyback being hit by a triple Stunning Spell . Greyback is the main werewolf within the pack that agrees to aid Voldemort in the Battle of Hogwarts . During the battle , Hermione , using a blasting curse , prevents Greyback from attacking injured Lavender Brown , and a crystal ball thrown by Professor Trelawney stuns him . He rejoins the battle in time for the Death Eaters \\' last stand , when Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom combine forces to take him down by magic . Dave Legeno portrayed Greyback in the film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince . He reprised the role in both parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . Igor Karkaroff Igor Karkaroff ( Cyrillic : Игорь Каркаров ) is the Headmaster at Durmstrang Institute , one of the three schools ( together with Hogwarts and Beauxbatons Academy ) that enter the Triwizard Tournament . As Headmaster , Karkaroff is also one of the judges . He is described as a neat , fussy-looking man with an oily voice and manner who sports a small grey goatee . While unctuously pleasant most of the time , he is capable of violent rage . He is also described as \" a man with yellowish teeth whose smile does not reach his cold stare \" . Karkaroff is angered and threatens to withdraw from the tournament when Harry is selected as a fourth champion and second representative for Hogwarts . Although he is talked down and agrees to stay , he nevertheless shows evident favouritism towards the Durmstrang champion , Bulgarian Quidditch player Viktor Krum . Sirius Black later identifies Karkaroff as a former Death Eater . Karkaroff was captured by Auror Alastor Moody and imprisoned in Azkaban . Karkaroff later told the Ministry of Magic that he had seen the error of his ways , and \" named names \" , putting many people in Azkaban in exchange for his freedom . Karkaroff is thus also hated by the Death Eaters . Karkaroff \\'s history gives him a connection with Snape , also a former Death Eater . Karkaroff interrupts a Potions lesson demanding to talk to Snape , and shows him his Dark Mark reappearing . He also apparently has an unpleasant history with Alastor Moody , and tries to avoid him unsuccessfully for the entirety of the tournament , not knowing that it is Barty Crouch Jr . in disguise . At the end of the novel , following Voldemort \\'s return , Karkaroff goes into hiding , leaving behind his student charges at Durmstrang . In the sixth novel , Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince , Remus Lupin states that Karkaroff was found dead in a shack with the Dark Mark hovering over it , an indication that he was killed by other Death Eaters . Lupin also expresses surprise that Karkaroff managed to live even a year after deserting Voldemort and that no one else has been known to avoid capture quite as long . Predrag Bjelac appeared as Karkaroff in the film adaptation of Goblet of Fire . Bellatrix Lestrange Bellatrix Lestrange ( née Black ) is the first female Death Eater introduced in the books . Aunt of Draco Malfoy and Nyphadora Tonks . She was introduced in Harry Potter and the Order Of The Phoenix . She is the most faithful member of Voldemort \\'s inner circle . She is described as being highly attractive yet emaciated due to her time in Azkaban . Bellatrix is portrayed as paranoid , insane , sadistic , and fanatically devoted to Voldemort , seeing service to him as the noblest duty for any true wizard or witch . Bellatrix takes an obvious pleasure in acts of torture and cruelty , as demonstrated when she kills her cousin , Sirius Black and niece Nymphadora Tonks , and tortures Hermione and Griphook at Malfoy manor . She is a witch of prodigious ability , as demonstrated by her many victories in duels against other characters , and as noted by Harry in the final book . Draco Malfoy Draco Malfoy is the pure blooded son of Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy . He was a notorious bully to Harry Potter and his friends because Hermione has Muggle parents , Draco was also assigned to kill Dumbledore , but his heart told him otherwise and Snape had to do it for him . Draco , like his family , is part of Slytherin house . Lucius Malfoy Lucius Malfoy is a Death Eater , head of a wealthy pure-blood wizarding family . He lives with his wife Narcissa Malfoy ( née Black ) and their son Draco at the Malfoy Manor in Wiltshire . Lucius was a school governor of Hogwarts before being sacked , and has very close connections at the Ministry of Magic . To maintain his reputation and influence , he makes donations to the Ministry , to charity , and to St Mungo \\'s Hospital . He was educated at Hogwarts , where he was a prefect in Slytherin House . He debuts as the main antagonist in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets , in which just before Draco and Harry \\'s second year at Hogwarts , Lucius plants Tom Riddle \\'s diary in Ginny Weasley \\'s potions cauldron while she is shopping for school supplies at Flourish & Blotts , in a plot to use her to reopen the Chamber of Secrets , which would lead to attacks on Muggle-born students . Lucius knows the diary is cleverly enchanted , but is not aware that it is a horcrux containing a part of Voldemort \\'s soul . He is careless with it and punished by Voldemort himself . Lucius intends to use the opening of the Chamber of Secrets by Ginny to discredit her father , Arthur Weasley , and Dumbledore . Lucius \\' plans are ultimately thwarted with the help of the Malfoys \\' house-elf Dobby , and Harry , but not before the Chamber is opened and Lucius uses the ensuing terror ( and threats to attack their families ) to influence the school \\'s Board of Governors to discredit and dismiss Dumbledore as Headmaster . Subsequently , Harry tricks Lucius into setting Dobby free . Upon this , Lucius attempts to attack Harry with his wand but Dobby disarms him before he can do any harm . Lucius is ultimately stripped of his title as a Hogwarts school governor . Despite his sacking , he still maintains strong ties with the Ministry of Magic . Lucius next appears in the beginning of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire during the Quidditch World Cup , sharing prime seats in the Top Box with Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge . Later in that book , when Voldemort rises again and summons his Death Eaters , Malfoy rejoins him and asserts that he had done everything he could to help his master , who however remains unimpressed . Harry reports Malfoy \\'s declarations to Minister Fudge , who refuses to believe him . Thus , the wealthy Malfoy continues to maintain strong ties with the Ministry . During the climax of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , Malfoy is the leader of the Death Eaters who are sent to retrieve the prophecy from Harry in the Hall of Prophecy . Lucius tries several ways to get the prophecy from Harry without breaking it , but the boy and his friends manage to escape from the Hall . Malfoy finally meets him in the Death Chamber , where Harry is about to give it to Malfoy when the Order of the Phoenix breaks into the Ministry and begins to duel with the Death Eaters . Dumbledore himself arrives at the end of the battle and Malfoy is captured and sent to Azkaban . By the final book , Voldemort has given Malfoy his freedom , though he looks significantly the worse for wear , having lost Voldemort \\'s favour . Voldemort treats him with great contempt by hijacking his house for Headquarters , and is forcing his son to do dark deeds against his nature , sparking sympathy for the notorious family for the first time in the series . Voldemort borrows Lucius \\' wand which is accidentally destroyed by Harry Potter . Later in the book , Lucius , along with his wife and sister-in-law , accidentally allow Harry and his friends to escape from Malfoy Manor . Voldemort punishes them severely , eventually putting them under house arrest . Despite his long-standing position as a Death Eater and Voldemort \\'s advocate of pure-blood supremacy , Lucius decides his love for his family is more important than his involvement in the war . During the Battle of Hogwarts , he pleads with Voldemort to let him onto the battlefield to locate his son . He and the rest of his family are reunited at the end of the book . Following Voldemort \\'s death , Lucius , Narcissa , and Draco all manage to \" weasel their way out \" of being sent to Azkaban due to Narcissa \\'s aiding Harry in the Forbidden Forest . Lucius \\'s ultimate fate after Deathly Hallows is unknown , but actor Jason Isaacs stated in an interview with Syfy Wire that he believes Lucius would not feel like a member of wizarding society again after Voldemort \\'s fall , as society would shun him . Isaacs also states that Lucius would become a shell of his former self , lose the respect of his wife and son , protect himself with his money , and drink himself into an early death . According to Forbes magazine , in 2006 , Lucius Malfoy was number 12 on their Forbes Fictional 15 list . In the film series , Lucius is portrayed by Jason Isaacs as an adult . Scenes with Tony Coburn as a teenage Lucius were cut from the final movie . Peter Pettigrew Peter Pettigrew , ( a.k.a Wormtail ) , is the only Death Eater known to have been in a House other than Slytherin ( Gryffindor ) while at Hogwarts . There , he was a close friend of Sirius Black , James Potter , and Remus Lupin , although he was the least intelligent and least talented of the group . With Sirius and James \\' help , Pettigrew becomes an Animagus , with the ability to transform at will into a rat . After leaving Hogwarts , Pettigrew joins forces with Voldemort , and in exchange for his own life becomes Voldemort \\'s spy within the Order of the Phoenix , of which Pettigrew is a member . When the Potters know that their son , Harry , is Voldemort \\'s target , Sirius suggests to them to use Pettigrew as Secret-Keeper because he does not believe Voldemort would ever suspect a \" weak , talentless thing \" like Pettigrew . Pettigrew betrays the secret to Voldemort , an act that leads to James and Lily \\'s death ( and , ironically , Voldemort \\'s near-destruction ) . Sirius seeks revenge on Pettigrew , but during the confrontation , Pettigrew publicly accuses Sirius of the Potters \\' deaths , murders twelve Muggles , and cuts off his own index finger before transforming into a rat , thereby framing Sirius for the betrayal of the Potters , as well as for his own murder and that of the bystanders . Despite having done these above treacherous acts , Pettigrew genuinely felt remorse to a certain extent for his betrayal . Pettigrew is ( seemingly posthumously ) awarded the Order of Merlin , and hides during the next twelve years . Wanting to keep an eye on the wizarding world , he masquerades as a rat , first as Percy Weasley \\'s pet , and then as Ron Weasley \\'s . In this form ( named \" Scabbers \" by the family ) , he is missing a toe from one paw due to the finger he cut off . Although Pettigrew appears in the first two books in the form of Scabbers , his identity is not revealed until Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , in which he is the main antagonist . When a photograph of the Weasley family appears in the Daily Prophet newspaper , Sirius recognises Pettigrew \\'s Animagus form and escapes from Azkaban to track him down . The two confront each other in the Shrieking Shack , where Lupin and Black compel Scabbers to resume his human form . Pettigrew confesses his treachery , claiming to have committed it only to save his own life . With Sirius and Lupin about to take their revenge , Harry begs Sirius to turn Pettigrew over to the Ministry of Magic instead , to prove Sirius \\' innocence . Pettigrew escapes while being led out of the Shack when Lupin transforms into a werewolf . Harry \\'s actions result in Pettigrew owing him a life debt , and Pettigrew had in fact shown gratitude to Harry for sparing his life . This would be the reason behind Pettigrew ( fruitlessly ) trying to convince Voldemort to use the blood of another wizard when Voldemort wanted to use Harry \\'s blood to restore his corporeal form in the next book . Pettigrew returns to the service of Voldemort , seeking him out in the forests of Albania and helping him to return to a feeble baby \\'s body . He abducts a Ministry of Magic employee named Bertha Jorkins , who is able to provide Voldemort with valuable information . Pettigrew ( almost always referred to as \" Wormtail \" hereafter ) assists Barty Crouch Jr . in overpowering Mad-Eye Moody , setting up the events in the fourth book , Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . In the climactic confrontation in that book , Pettigrew murders Cedric Diggory on Voldemort \\'s orders , and brews the complex potion to regenerate Voldemort , severing his hand as one of the ingredients . Upon his return to corporeal form , Voldemort replaces Pettigrew \\'s missing hand with a silver one that possesses five intact fingers and great strength . Despite his actions , Pettigrew \\'s fortunes remain low ; in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Snape treats him as a servant , and in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows he is tasked with keeping watch over prisoners in the cellar of Malfoy Manor . While Harry and Ron are being kept there , Pettigrew checks on the prisoners and is attacked . Pettigrew begins strangling Harry with the silver hand , but when reminded by Harry that he once saved his life , Pettigrew hesitates for a moment . The silver hand turns against him and strangles him to death as punishment for his moment of pity . Pettigrew is portrayed by Timothy Spall as an adult , and by Charles Hughes as a teenager in the films . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 , Pettigrew is not strangled to death by his own silver hand in Malfoy Manor as in the book ; he is instead struck by Dobby and collapses . It is unknown whether he was simply stunned or killed . He only appears in a flashback in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 . Severus Snape Severus Snape is characterised as a person of considerable complexity , whose coldly sarcastic and controlled exterior conceals deep emotions and anguish . In the first novel of the series , Snape is a teacher who is hostile from the start toward Harry and is built up to be the primary antagonist until the final chapters . As the series progresses , Snape \\'s portrayal evolves from that of a malicious and partisan teacher to that of a complex , pivotal character of moral ambiguity , whose true loyalties are not revealed until the end . Snape is , as revealed in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , actually a spy in Voldemort \\'s ranks for Dumbledore . Corban Yaxley Corban Yaxley is the brutal-faced Death Eater who is present in the battle in which Snape killed Dumbledore . He is one of the more prominent Death Eaters , and one of Voldemort \\'s spies in the Ministry of Magic . In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows , Yaxley is invited to Malfoy Manor to witness the murder of Charity Burbage , and argues with Snape about the correct date of Harry \\'s departure from the Dursleys \\' , but John Dawlish , an Auror who is tricked by an Order member , gives him incorrect information . Yaxley announces to an impressed assemblage of Death Eaters that he has placed the Imperius Curse upon Pius Thicknesse , the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement . He uses Thicknesse to Imperius the other major department heads and they allow Voldemort to murder Rufus Scrimgeour ; thus Thicknesse becomes Minister for Magic . When Harry , Ron , and Hermione , disguised as ministry officials , enter the Ministry to find Slytherin \\'s locket , it is revealed that Yaxley has become Head of Magical Law Enforcement . He also assists Dolores Umbridge in leading the Muggle-Born Registration Commission , and the two seem to have a good relationship , together humiliating the Muggle-borns . Both are immobilised by Harry , but Yaxley recovers and grabs Hermione while she is Apparating her friends to safety . Yaxley arrives with them at Grimmauld Place , allowing him to reveal their headquarters to the Death Eaters , but not to the location that the trio subsequently Apparate to . He participates in the Battle of Hogwarts , where he duels with Professor Flitwick and is later seen among those who wait with Voldemort for Harry Potter to come to him , mistakenly believing that Harry would not come within the allotted time . When the battle resumes , he is defeated by George Weasley and Lee Jordan . Peter Mullan plays Yaxley in the film adaptation of Deathly Hallows . In popular culture Mexican heavy metal band Velvet Darkness released the song \" Death Eaters \" in 2015 as part of their debut EP Delusion . It was later rerecorded in 2018 as bonus track for their debut LP Nothing But Glory , and a music video for the song was released in 2019 with a live recording of it .

References', 'Hatter \\'s Castle ( 1931 ) is the first novel of author A . J . Cronin . The story is set in 1879 , in the fictional town of Levenford , on the Firth of Clyde . The plot revolves around many characters and has many subplots , all of which relate to the life of the hatter , James Brodie , whose narcissism and cruelty gradually destroy his family and life . The book was made into a successful film in 1942 starring Robert Newton , Deborah Kerr , and James Mason . Characters The main characters are James Brodie ( the hatter and tyrannical patriarch of the Brodie family ) , Mary Brodie ( James \\' elder daughter , also one of the central characters , appearing throughout the first and last section of the novel ) , Matthew Brodie ( James \\' only son and oldest child in the family who also plays a significant role in the novel ) , Nessie Brodie ( James \\' younger daughter and favourite , who remains one of the background characters until the end of the story ) , Mrs . Brodie ( James \\' fragile wife who is never treated as anything more than a servant by her husband ) , Grandma Brodie ( James \\' mother who lives with the Brodie family ) , Dennis Foyle ( A young Irishman who has a relationship with Mary ) , Nancy ( James \\' mistress ) and Dr . Renwick ( a character who becomes more involved in the Brodies \\' family life towards the end of the novel ) . Plot summary The book is in three sections . Part 1 The novel begins with some insight into the life of the Brodie household , where James Brodie seems to have everyone under his thumb . The main event that triggers the events in the novel is Mary Brodie \\'s relationship with her first love , Dennis . Early in the story , Mary , who has occasionally met Dennis at the library , is invited by him to go to the fair in the town . She sneaks out without her family \\'s knowledge and not only goes to the fair , but later on that night kisses and eventually makes love to Dennis , which we later learn , results in pregnancy . This event of her unwanted pregnancy is the main plot in the first third of the novel , titled \" Section One \" . We realise that Mary is pregnant , and when she is six months pregnant she makes a plan with Dennis to elope . Even though Mary was only seventeen , there would have been no legal problem with her marriage since the English law which , until 1970 , generally required people under twenty-one to have parental consent to marry , did not apply in Scotland . But three days before Dennis is due to whisk Mary away , there is a massive storm , and she begins to go into labour . Mrs . Brodie stumbles into Mary \\'s room and begins to scream at the fact that her daughter is with child , and calls James himself to sort it out . After being kicked in the stomach repeatedly by her father and thrown out on her face into the pouring rain ( whilst in labour ) , she tries to reach safety . Mary nearly drowns in a river before finding a barn where she gives birth to her premature child , which dies . Dennis , who was , travelling on a train to rescue Mary , is killed when the train derails and plunges into the River Tay below , a retelling of the actual Tay Bridge disaster of 1879 . Part 2 In the second part of the book , James Brodie \\'s business as a hatter is destroyed . A rival company moves next door and attracts all his customers . Part of this is due to Brodie \\'s pride , as the customers are driven away by his delusions of superiority . As his profits decrease , so does the weekly salary , so Mamma is left to deal with making the most of what little they have left for the family . Her illness , cancer of the womb , and the chronic stress of living with James Brodie hasten her death . After her death , Brodie \\'s mistress , Nancy , moves in . Later she goes off abroad with Brodie \\'s son Matt , and Brodie is left with only his younger daughter , Nessie , and his aged mother , Grandma Brodie . Part 3 In the third part of the book , Brodie forces Nessie to study hard so as to win the \" Latta \" , a valuable bursarship . He wants this not so much to provide a good future for his daughter , as to show that she is better than his rival \\'s son , who is also entered for it . Under his threats and the dreadful fear of failure , she labours on with it , making herself mentally and physically ill . Nessie secretly writes to Mary asking her to come back , so she will have her company and comfort . Under pretext of coming to help with housework , Mary writes to her father , who initially refuses her return . After discovering that Nancy has deserted him , he writes again permitting Mary to come back , so she does . Nessie obtains notice of the Latta result before her father sees it . Finding that her rival has won it and fearing her father , she sends Mary out to the chemist on the pretext of getting some medicine , then dresses up and hangs herself . The story concludes with Dr . Renwick , who has been seeing Mary , taking her away with him to marry her .

Angela knew it was really Peter , but what she did not know was that Peter , as a means of remaining faithful to Lois , hid Mort Goldman ( who did it for $ 2 ) in his pants so it was Mort who actually had sex with her , not Peter . In \" The Simpsons Guy \" , Angela attended the trial in Springfield between Duff Beer and Pawtucket Patriot Ale . Following Carrie Fisher \\'s unexpected death on December 27 , 2016 , Seth MacFarlane revealed that Angela would appear on at least two more episodes that Fisher had already done voiceover work on in season 15 , but would not comment on the character \\'s future except by saying that \" Family Guy will miss [ Fisher ] immensely . \" Her final appearance was during the sixteenth-season episode \" Do n\\'t Be A Dickens At Christmas \" aired on December 10 , 2017 .

He laughs in a loud manner at sarcastic or ironic statements before explaining why the joke was funny ( for example , \" Ahh ! Is funny because ... \" ) . Peter does not seem to have a strong relationship with Fouad , likely due to his comparatively short time employed at the Pawtucket Brewery , however Peter gets along much better with Fouad than he does with Opie or Angela . Fouad first appears in \" Chick Cancer \" , being introduced by Peter as that foreign guy at work who helped him understand sarcasm . In \" Blue Harvest \" , Fouad plays Lieutenant Shann Childsen on the Death Star prison deck , who laughs when Chewbacca ( played by Brian ) asks for a cell by the pool , stating that it is funny because prisons do not have luxury areas such as swimming pools .

Fouad \\'s voice is also heard off-camera in a DVD exclusive scene in \" Three Kings \" .

Elmer Hartman ( voiced by Seth MacFarlane ) – An incompetent doctor who works at Quahog \\'s hospital . Dr . Hartman is generally shown to be an unskilled doctor and his skills fluctuate from episode to episode . In one episode , he mentions his Yale Medical School degree , but then implies it is a product of his calligraphy skills . Occasionally , he seems to know exactly what he is doing and performs great medical feats , such as plastic surgery to restore Peter \\'s face , to other episodes where he does not even understand common medical terminology , or needs a chart to find body parts and lets Meg take care of patients while he is gone , as in \" You Ca n\\'t Do That on Television , Peter \" . He temporarily loses his medical license in \" Stewie Loves Lois \" when Peter accuses him of rape ( it turns out that Hartman had in fact merely performed a normal prostate exam , though Peter did not understand the procedure ) . He manages to regain his license after treating Peter \\'s urination problem . In \" Believe It or Not , Joe \\'s Walking on Air \" , Peter brought up the fact that Hartman sounds very similar to Carter Pewterschmidt when he speaks . As a response , Hartman tells Peter that Carter is one of his patients and that there are only so many voices in the world ; some are bound to be similar and that he never noticed because they do not talk all that much despite the fact that Carter is in fact a patient of his . This was brought up to turn the scenario that MacFarlane voices both Hartman and Carter into a comical situation . His name comes from MacFarlane \\'s close friend and fellow animator Elmer \" Butch \" Hartman . In \" New Kidney in Town \" , Hartman gives Peter one of his kidneys because the Griffin family are his last paying customers .

Stewie turns the club into a trendy Hollywood style night club called pLace that ultimately fails when Andy Dick shows up to party .

God ( voiced by Seth MacFarlane ) – The father of Jesus Christ and the creator of life . He is a central part of the basic tenets in the religion of Christianity . Although the basic concept of God exists in other monotheistic and polytheistic religions , it is the Christian God that serves as the basis for the character in Family Guy . His appearance in the show is the stereotypical appearance of an Abrahamic god in the Western world ; a bald-headed Caucasian man with long white hair , a huge white beard and a white robe . Contrary to the widespread belief of a benevolent and pure God , the \" God \" character in Family Guy has often been shown to have several human flaws , especially being shown as being socially irresponsible and sexually perverted . In the episode \" Fifteen Minutes of Shame \" , he aims a sniper rifle with red dot sight at Meg from the clouds after she says , \" Oh God , kill me now \" , but is interrupted by a phone call before he can complete the task . In the episode \" Blind Ambition \" , God flirts with a woman at the Drunken Clam , and lights her a cigarette with lightning before accidentally vaporizing her and setting the bar on fire , to which he exclaims , \" Jesus Christ ! \" Jesus then arrives , and hastily leaves the area with God in a Cadillac Escalade before they can be caught up in the blaze . In \" Untitled Griffin Family History \" , God asks his roommate Chuggs for a lighter , using it to light a fart . On his second attempt , the lit fart sets in motion the Big Bang that creates the universe . In \" The Courtship of Stewie \\'s Father \" , Joseph quarrels with a teenage Jesus , before Jesus storms out of the room shouting , \" You \\'re not my real father ! \" . He then goes on to give God a phone call asking if he can go back to live with him in Heaven , but is rejected . God then turns to a young woman named Janet lying in his bed , hoping to have sex with her . Janet hands him a condom to his disappointment , and asks her to reconsider , saying it is his birthday , but Janet refuses . In \" Partial Terms of Endearment \" , Peter thanks God thinking he is set to participate in a threesome with Lois and her friend Naomi , to which God replies \" Do n\\'t mention it , Peter \" . A jingle is then heard singing , \" God ! He knows what turns you on ! \" after which God says , \" Have fun ! \" In \" Into Fat Air \" , God and Jesus discuss on how to name a country in the Himalayas . God says that the mountains look like nipples , to which Jesus replies by saying that he can not just call a country \" Nipples \" . In response , God suggests the name \" Nepal \" to Jesus \\' approval . In other episodes , God \\'s serious side has also been shown on occasion such as in \" If I \\'m Dyin \\' , I \\'m Lyin \\' \" where he curses Peter with six of the 10 plagues after he lied to the people of Quahog about being a healer and is then worshipped as a god . Horace ( voiced by Johnny Brennan ) – The proprietor and bartender of The Drunken Clam for 30 years . Has been shown to have been working there for at least as long as Peter and his friends have been regulars . Horace has also been shot a handful of times , but has recovered from each incident .

In \" Blind Ambition \" , Horace \\'s life is saved by Peter ( who was blind at the time ) when The Drunken Clam was on fire . In \" Save the Clam \" , Horace is accidentally killed when a baseball hit by Jerome hits him during a baseball game between The Drunken Clam and Mort \\'s Pharmacy . His death causes the bank to close The Drunken Clam which was enough for Peter , Joe and Quagmire to protest this until Jerome buys The Drunken Clam to keep Horace \\'s legacy alive . Jake Tucker ( voiced by Seth MacFarlane ) – Tom Tucker \\'s deformed son and Chris \\' former classmate . Jake \\'s many appearances show him with an \" upside-down face \" ; a mouth near the top of his head and eyes near the bottom . In \" It Takes a Village Idiot , and I Married One \" , he gets a normal face , via toxic waste . Although typically depicted as a demanding and obnoxious brat , Jake craves his father \\'s attention , which he rarely gets . It is also revealed in \" Peter Griffin : Husband , Father ... Brother ? \" that he \" does n\\'t have a bottom \" . Though Tom often neglects him , he often shows that he cares when Brian accused Jake of giving Chris alcohol . However , when Chris gets his own back on Jake by planting drugs in his locker an enraged Tom declares him a \" bad boy \" and loses faith in him . In \" Mother Tucker \" , Jake is noticeably neglected by Tom when Tom pays more attention to Peter . But Peter then realizes that Tom should pay more attention to Jake .

References Animated human characters Lists of characters in American television adult animation', 'In the Hebrew Bible , Jethro ( ; , lit . \" His Excellence/Posterity \" ; ) was Moses \\' father-in-law , a Kenite shepherd and priest of Midian , sometimes named as Reuel ( or Raguel ) . In Exodus , Moses \\' father-in-law is initially referred to as \" Reuel \" ( Exodus 2:18 ) but then as \" Jethro \" ( Exodus 3:1 ) . He was also identified as Hobab in the Book of Numbers 10:29 . The relationship of the biblical Jethro to Islam and the Druze religion is controversial . Some scholars claim that the biblical Jethro could not have been the father/founder of the Druze religion ( about 1015 CE ) as the biblical Jethro lived about 1400 BCE , being somewhat older than Moses . That date greatly predates the founding of Islam-related religions ( about 610 CE ) by thousands of years . Therefore , some scholars claim that Jethro should not be revered as the spiritual founder and chief prophet in his own right of the Druze religion . He is considered an ancestor of all Druze . In Exodus Jethro is called a priest of Midian and became father-in-law of Moses after he gave his daughter , Zipporah , in marriage to Moses . He is introduced in . Jethro is recorded as living in Midian , a territory stretching along the eastern edge of the Gulf of Aqaba , northwestern Arabia . Some believe Midian is within the Sinai Peninsula . Biblical maps from antiquity show Midian on both locations . Jethro \\'s daughter , Zipporah , became Moses \\'s wife after Moses had fled Egypt , having killed an Egyptian who was beating a Hebrew slave . Having fled to Midian , Moses intervened in a water-access dispute between Jethro \\'s seven daughters and the local shepherds ; Jethro consequently invited Moses into his home and offered him hospitality . However , Moses remained conscious that he was a stranger in exile , naming his first son ( Jethro \\'s grandson ) \" Gershom \" , meaning \" stranger there \" . Moses is said to have worked as a shepherd for Jethro for 40 years before returning to Egypt to lead the Hebrews to Canaan , the \" promised land \" . After the Battle at Rephidim against the Amalekites , word reached Jethro that under Moses \\' leadership the Israelites had been delivered out of Egypt , so he set out to meet with Moses . They met in the wilderness at the \" Mountain of God \" ; Moses recounted to Jethro all that had taken place , and then , according to Exodus 18:9–12a : Following this event , it was Jethro who encouraged Moses to appoint others to share in the burden of ministry to the nation Israel by allowing others to help in the judgment of smaller matters coming before him . These events take place in the Torah portion Yitro ( Exodus 18:1–20:23 ) . Names There is some disagreement over the name ( s ) of Moses \\' father-in-law . In the KJV translation of , a man named Hobab appears as Moses \\' father-in-law , while makes him \" the son of Raguel [ Reuel ] the Midianite , Moses \\' father in law \" . Reuel is noted , as \" a priest of Midian \" who had seven daughters . \" the girls returned to Reuel their father \" . Reuel becomes Moses \\' father in law in \" Moses agreed to stay with the man , who gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage . \" In Numbers 10:29 , the Hebrew for the name Raguel is the same as the Hebrew for Reuel . The reason for the difference is that the Hebrew character ( ayin ) in is sometimes used merely as a vowel and sometimes as \" g \" , \" ng \" , and \" gn \" , because of the difficulty of its pronunciation by European speakers . Re-u-el , with the first syllable strong accented , is nearer to the true pronunciation . Some suppose he was father to Hobab , who was also called Jethro , a likely possibility . It became , however , generally accepted that he had seven names : \" Reuel \" , \" Jether \" , \" Jethro \" , \" Hobab \" , \" Heber \" , \" Keni \" ( comp . Judges i . 16 , iv . 11 ) , and \" Putiel \" ; Eleazar \\'s father-in-law ( Ex . vi . 25 ) being identified with Jethro by interpreting his name either as \" he who abandoned idolatry \" or as \" who fattened calves for the sake of sacrifices to the idol \" . According to some modern scholars , \" Jethro \" was really a title meaning \" his Excellency \" , and the actual name was Reuel . Druze Jethro , Moses \\' non-Hebrew father-in-law , is a central figure , particularly in the rites and pilgrimages , of the Druze religion . He is viewed as a Prophet in Druze belief . Nabi Shuʿayb is the site recognized by Druze as the tomb of Shuʿayb . It is located in Hittin in the Lower Galilee and is the holiest shrine and most important pilgrimage site for the Druze . Each year on 25 April , the Druze gather at the site in a holiday known as Ziyarat al-Nabi Shuʿayb to discuss community affairs and commemorate the anniversary of Jethro \\'s death with singing , dancing and feasting . Another Druze shrine in Ein Qiniyye is the supposed burial place of Jethro \\'s sister , Sit Shahwana . Jethro is revered as the chief prophet in the Druze religion . They believe he was a \" hidden \" and \" true prophet \" who communicated directly with God and then passed on that knowledge to Moses , whom they describe as a \" recognised \" and \" revealed prophet . \" According to Druze belief , Moses was allowed to wed Zipporah , the daughter of Jethro , after helping save his daughters and their flock from competing herdsmen . He is also considered an ancestor of the Druze ; as is expressed by such prominent Druze as Amal Nasser el-Din , and according to Salman Tarif , who was a prominent Druze shaykh , this makes the Druze related to the Jews through marriage . This view has been used to represent an element of the special relationship between Israeli Jews and Druze . The Israeli Druze also have a folktale called \" Jethro \\'s revenge on the [ Sunni Muslim ] inhabitants of the village of Hittin . \" In Islam he is mentioned in the Quran as a prophet who was sent to the city of Midian . His people were destroyed because of their corruption except for the believers . He is thought to be the father-in-law for prophet Moses .

References Cultural property of national significance in the canton of Vaud\", 'Bystander intervention is a type of training used in post-secondary education institutions to prevent sexual assault or rape , binge drinking and harassment and unwanted comments of a racist , homophobic , or transphobic nature . A bystander is a person who is present at an event , party , or other setting who notices a problematic situation , such as a someone making sexual advances on a drunk person . The bystander then takes on personal responsibility and takes action to intervene , with the goal of preventing the situation from escalating . The bystander who is intervening has several options , including distracting either of the people , getting help from others , checking in later , or directly intervening . There are risks to bystander intervention ; it can lead to fights , it can ruin the mood for the people who were \" intervened \" into , and it can lead to confrontations . Bystander intervention may also be called \" bystander education \" , because the model is based on a system of educating trainers and leaders who will then go on to train people from their community . Preventing sexual assault One bystander intervention researcher suggests that a potential sexual assault be stopped by pretending to spill a drink on a drunk man who is trying to make sexual moves on an intoxicated woman , to distract him and \" ... stop bad behavior before it crosses the line from drunken partying to sexual assault \" . Advocates hope that bystander intervention programs can yield the same results on sexual assault that designated driver initiatives have had in reducing impaired driving ; another similarity is that both programs do not discourage drinking itself , only the combination of drinking and law-breaking . Some US universities are introducing bystander education initiatives to comply with Title IX , which requires US universities which receive federal funding to not discriminate according to gender . Research A study on bystander intervention by the University of New Hampshire showed that 38 percent of the men who saw a bystander intervention campaign said they intervened to stop a sexual assault , versus only 12 percent of the control group ( who did not see the campaign ) . An Ohio University study compared men who took a bystander intervention session with a group of men who did not have the training ; 1.5 percent of the bystander intervention participants said they had committed sexual assault over the last four months , versus 6.7 percent from the untrained group . One challenge with bystander education programs is that a study has shown that white female students are less likely to intervene in a hypothetical situation where they see an intoxicated black woman being led towards a bedroom at a party by a non-intoxicated male , as white students feel \" less personal responsibility \" to help women of colour and they feel that the black woman is deriving pleasure from the situation .

The concepts of mashiach , messianism , and of a Messianic Age originated in Judaism , and in the Hebrew Bible , in which a mashiach is a king or High Priest traditionally anointed with holy anointing oil . Ha mashiach ( ) , often referred to as ( ) , is to be a Jewish leader , physically descended from the paternal Davidic line through King David and King Solomon . He is thought to accomplish predetermined things in a future arrival , including the unification of the tribes of Israel , the gathering of all Jews to Eretz Israel , the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem , the ushering in of a Messianic Age of global universal peace , and the annunciation of the world to come . Messiahs were not exclusively Jewish , however , and the concept of \\'the \\' Messiah as a single individual is a strictly post-Biblical tradition as it is not found in the Old Testament . The Greek translation of Messiah is Khristós ( ) , anglicized as Christ . Christians commonly refer to Jesus of Nazareth as either the \" Christ \" or the \" Messiah \" , believing that the messianic prophecies were fulfilled in the mission , death , and resurrection of Jesus and that he will return to fulfill the rest of messianic prophecies . Moreover , unlike the Judaic concept of the Messiah , Jesus Christ is additionally considered by Christians to be the Son of God . In Islam , Jesus ( ) is held to have been a prophet and the Messiah sent to the Israelites , who will return to Earth at the end of times along with the Mahdi , and defeat al-Masih ad-Dajjal , the false Messiah . In Ahmadiyya theology , these prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus are believed to have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835–1908 ) , the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement , wherein the terms Messiah and Mahdi are synonyms for one and the same person . In Chabad messianism , Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn ( r . 1920–1950 ) , sixth Rebbe ( spiritual leader ) of Chabad Lubavitch , and Menachem Mendel Schneerson ( 1902–1994 ) , seventh Rebbe of Chabad , are Messiah claimants . Etymology Messiah ( Hebrew : , or , mashiach ; ; , ; ) literally means \\'anointed one \\' . In Hebrew , the Messiah is often referred to as ( ; Tiberian : , ) , literally meaning \\'the Anointed King \\' . The Greek Septuagint version of the Old Testament renders all 39 instances of the Hebrew mašíaḥ as Khristós ( ) . The New Testament records the Greek transliteration Messias ( ) twice in John . ( , , lit . \\'the anointed \\' , \\'the traveller \\' , or \\'one who cures by caressing \\' ) is the Arabic word for messiah used by both Arab Christians and Muslims . In modern Arabic , it is used as one of the many titles of Jesus , referred to as ( ) by Arab Christians and ( ) by Muslims . Judaism The literal translation of the Hebrew word mashiach ( , messiah ) , is \\'anointed \\' , which refers to a ritual of consecrating someone or something by putting holy oil upon it . It is used throughout the Hebrew Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects ; for example , kings , priests and prophets , the altar in the Temple , vessels , unleavened bread , and even a non-Jewish king ( Cyrus the Great ) . In Jewish eschatology , the term came to refer to a future Jewish king from the Davidic line , who will be \" anointed \" with holy anointing oil , to be king of God \\'s kingdom , and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age . In Judaism , the Messiah is not considered to be God or a pre-existent divine Son of God . He is considered to be a great political leader that has descended from King David , hence why he is referred to as Messiah ben David , \\'Messiah , son of David \\' . In Judaism , the messiah is considered to be a great , charismatic leader that is well oriented with the laws that are followed in Judaism . He will be the one who will not \" judge by what his eyes see \" or \" decide by what his ears hear . \" Belief in the eventual coming of a future messiah is a fundamental part of Judaism , and is one of Maimonides \\' 13 Principles of Faith . Maimonides describes the identity of the Messiah in the following terms : Even though the eventual coming of the messiah is a strongly upheld belief in Judaism , trying to predict the actual time when the messiah will come is an act that is frowned upon . These kinds of actions are thought to weaken the faith the people have in the religion . So in Judaism , there is no specific time when the messiah comes . Rather , it is the acts of the people that determines when the messiah comes . It is said that the messiah would come either when the world needs his coming the most ( when the world is so sinful and in desperate need of saving by the messiah ) or deserves it the most ( when genuine goodness prevails in the world ) . A common modern rabbinic interpretation is that there is a potential messiah in every generation . The Talmud , which often uses stories to make a moral point ( aggadah ) , tells of a highly respected rabbi who found the Messiah at the gates of Rome and asked him , \" When will you finally come ? \" He was quite surprised when he was told , \" Today . \" Overjoyed and full of anticipation , the man waited all day . The next day he returned , disappointed and puzzled , and asked , \" You said messiah would come \\'today \\' but he did n\\'t come ! What happened ? \" The Messiah replied , \" Scripture says , \\'Today , if you will but hearken to his voice . \\' \" A Kabbalistic tradition within Judaism is that the commonly discussed messiah who will usher in a period of freedom and peace , Messiah ben David , will be preceded by Messiah ben Joseph , who will gather the children of Israel around him , lead them to Jerusalem . After overcoming the hostile powers in Jerusalem , Messiah ben Joseph , will reestablish the Temple-worship and set up his own dominion . Then Armilus , according to one group of sources , or Gog and Magog , according to the other , will appear with their hosts before Jerusalem , wage war against Messiah ben Joseph , and slay him . His corpse , according to one group , will lie unburied in the streets of Jerusalem ; according to the other , it will be hidden by the angels with the bodies of the Patriarchs , until Messiah ben David comes and brings him back to life . Chabad Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn ( r . 1920–1950 ) , sixth Rebbe ( spiritual leader ) of Chabad Lubavitch , and Menachem Mendel Schneerson ( 1902–1994 ) , seventh Rebbe of Chabad , are messiah claimants . As per Chabad-Lubavitch messianism , Menachem Mendel Schneerson openly declared his deceased father-in-law , the former 6th Rebbe of Chabad Lubavitch , to be the Messiah . He published about Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn to be \" Atzmus u\\'mehus alein vi er hat zich areingeshtalt in a guf \" ( Yiddish and English for : \" Essence and Existence [ of God ] which has placed itself in a body \" ) . The gravesite of his deceased father-in-law Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn , known as \" the Ohel \" , became a central point of focus for Menachem Mendel Schneerson \\'s prayers and supplications . Regarding the deceased Menachem Mendel Schneerson , a later Chabad Halachic ruling claims that it was \" incumbent on every single Jew to heed the Rebbe \\'s words and believe that he is indeed King Moshiach , who will be revealed imminently \" . Outside of Chabad messianism , in Judaism , there is no basis to these claims . If anything , this resembles the faith in the resurrection of Jesus and his second coming in early Christianity . Still today , the deceased rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson is believed to be the Messiah among adherents of the Chabad movement , and his second coming is believed to be imminent . He is venerated and invocated to by thousands of visitors and letters each year at the ( Ohel ) , especially in a pilgrimage each year on the anniversary of his death . Christianity Originating from the concept in Judaism , the Messiah in Christianity is called the Christ—from Greek khristós ( ) , translating the Hebrew word of the same meaning . \\'Christ \\' became the accepted Christian designation and title of Jesus of Nazareth , as Christians believe that the messianic prophecies in the Old Testament—that he is descended from the Davidic line , and was declared King of the Jews—were fulfilled in his mission , death , and resurrection , while the rest of the prophecies—that he will usher in a Messianic Age and the world to come—will be fulfilled at his Second Coming . Some Christian denominations , such as Catholicism , instead believe in amillenialist theology , but the Catholic Church has not adopted this term . The majority of historical and mainline Christian theologies consider Jesus to be the Son of God and God the Son , a concept of the messiah fundamentally different from the Jewish and Islamic concepts . In each of the four New Testament Gospels , the only literal anointing of Jesus is conducted by a woman . In the Gospels of Mark , Matthew , and John , this anointing occurs in Bethany , outside Jerusalem . In the Gospel of Luke , the anointing scene takes place at an indeterminate location , but the context suggests it to be in Galilee , or even a separate anointing altogether . Aside from Jesus , the Book of Isaiah refers to Cyrus the Great , king of the Achaemenid Empire , as a messiah for his decree to rebuild the Jerusalem Temple . Islam The Islamic faith uses the Arabic term ( , ) to refer to Jesus . However the meaning is different from that found in Christianity and Judaism : Though Islam shares many of the beliefs and characteristics of the two Semitic/Abrahamic/monotheistic religions which preceded it , the idea of messianism , which is of central importance in Judaism and Christianity , is alien to Islam as represented by the Qur\\'an . The Quran states that Jesus ( Isa ) , the son of Maryam ( Isa ibn Maryam ) , is the messiah ( al-masih ) and prophet sent to the Children of Israel . According to Qadi al-Nu\\'man , a famous Muslim jurist of the Fatimid period , the Quran identifies Jesus as the messiah because he was sent to the people who responded to him in order to remove ( masaha ) their impurities , the ailments of their faith , whether apparent ( ) or hidden ( ) . Jesus is one of the most important prophets in the Islamic tradition , along with Noah , Abraham , Moses , and Muhammad . Unlike Christians , Muslims see Jesus as a prophet , but not as God himself or the son of God . This is because prophecy in human form does not represent the true powers of God , contrary to the popular depiction of Jesus in Christianity . Thus , like all other Islamic prophets , Jesus is one of the grand prophets who receives revelations from God . According to religious scholar Mona Siddiqui , in Islam , \" [ p ] rophecy allows God to remain veiled and there is no suggestion in the Qur\\'an that God wishes to reveal of himself just yet . Prophets guarantee interpretation of revelation and that God \\'s message will be understood . \" In Sura 19 , the Quran describes the birth of Isa , and sura 4 explicitly states Isa as the Son of Maryam . Sunni Muslims believe Isa is alive in Heaven and did not die in the crucifixion . Sura 4 , verses 157–158 , also states that : According to religious scholar Mahmoud Ayoub , \" Jesus \\' close proximity or nearness ( qurb ) to God is affirmed in the Qur\\'anic insistence that Jesus did not die , but was taken up to God and remains with God . \" While the Quran does not state that he will come back , Islamic tradition nevertheless believes that Jesus will return at the end of times , shortly preceding Mahdi , and exercise his power of healing . He will forever destroy the falsehood embodied in al-Masih ad-Dajjal ( the false Messiah ) , the great falsifier , a figure similar to the Antichrist in Christianity , who will emerge shortly before Yawm al-Qiyāmah ( \\'the Day of Resurrection \\' ) . After he has destroyed ad-Dajjal , his final task will be to become leader of the Muslims . Isa will unify the Muslim Ummah ( the followers of Islam ) under the common purpose of worshipping Allah alone in pure Islam , thereby ending divisions and deviations by adherents . Mainstream Muslims believe that at that time , Isa will dispel Christian and Jewish claims about him . A hadith in Abu Dawud says : Both Sunni and Shia Muslims agree that al-Mahdi will arrive first , and after him , Isa . Isa will proclaim al-Mahdi as the Islamic community leader . A war will be fought—the Dajjal against al-Mahdi and Isa . This war will mark the approach of the coming of the Last Day . After Isa slays al-Dajjāl at the Gate of Lud , he will bear witness and reveal that Islam is indeed the true and last word from God to humanity as Yusuf Ali \\'s translation reads : A hadith in Sahih Bukhari says : The Quran denies the crucifixion of Jesus , claiming that he was neither killed nor crucified . The Quran also emphasizes the difference between Allah and the Messiah : Those who say that Allah is the Messiah , son of Mary , are unbelievers . The Messiah said : \" O Children of Israel , worship Allah , my Lord and your Lord ... unbelievers too are those who have said that Allah is the third of three ... the Messiah , son of Mary , was only a Messenger before whom other Messengers had gone . Shia Islam The Twelver branch of Shia ( or Shi \\' i ) Islam , which significantly values and revolves around the Twelve Imams ( spiritual leaders ) , differs significantly from the beliefs of Sunni Islam . Unlike Sunni Islam , \" Messianism is an essential part of religious belief and practice for almost all Shi \\' a Muslims . \" Shi \\' i Islam believes that the last Imam will return again , with the return of Jesus . According to religious scholar Mona Siddiqui , \" Shi\\'is are acutely aware of the existence everywhere of the twelfth Imam , who disappeared in 874 . \" Shi \\' i piety teaches that the hidden Imam will return with Jesus Christ to set up the messianic kingdom before the final Judgement Day , when all humanity will stand before God . There is some controversy as to the identity of this imam . There are sources that underscore how the Shia sect agrees with the Jews and Christians that Imam Mehdi ( al-Mahdi ) is another name for Elijah , whose return prior to the arrival of the Messiah was prophesied in the Old Testament . The Imams and Fatima will have a direct impact on the judgements rendered that day , representing the ultimate intercession . There is debate on whether Shi \\' i Muslims should accept the death of Jesus . Religious scholar Mahmoud Ayoub argues \" Modern Shi \\' i thinkers have allowed the possibility that Jesus died and only his spirit was taken up to heaven . \" Conversely , Siddiqui argues that Shi \\' i thinkers believe Jesus was \" neither crucified nor slain . \" She also argues that Shi \\' i Muslims believe that the twelfth imam did not die , but \" was taken to God to return in God \\'s time , \" and \" will return at the end of history to establish the kingdom of God on earth as the expected Mahdi . \" Ahmadiyya In the theology of Ahmadiyya , the terms Messiah and Mahdi are synonymous terms for one and the same person . The term Mahdi means \\'guided [ by God ] \\' , thus implying a direct ordainment by God of a divinely chosen individual . According to Ahmadi thought , Messiahship is a phenomenon through which a special emphasis is given on the transformation of a people by way of offering to suffer for the sake of God instead of giving suffering ( i.e . refraining from revenge ) . Ahmadis believe that this special emphasis was given through the person of Jesus and Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835–1908 ) among others . Ahmadis hold that the prophesied eschatological figures of Christianity and Islam , the Messiah and Mahdi , were , in fact , to be fulfilled in one person who was to represent all previous prophets . Numerous hadith are presented by the Ahmadis in support of their view , such as one from Sunan Ibn Majah , which says , \" There is No Mahdi other than Jesus son of Mary . \" Ahmadis believe that the prophecies concerning the Mahdi and the second coming of Jesus have been fulfilled in Mirza Ghulam Ahmad ( 1835–1908 ) , the founder of the Ahmadiyya Movement . Unlike mainstream Muslims , the Ahmadis do not believe that Jesus is alive in heaven , but that he survived the crucifixion and migrated towards the east where he died a natural death and that Ghulam Ahmad was only the promised spiritual second coming and likeness of Jesus , the promised Messiah and Mahdi . He also claimed to have appeared in the likeness of Krishna and that his advent fulfilled certain prophecies found in Hindu scriptures . He stated that the founder of Sikhism was a Muslim saint , who was a reflection of the religious challenges he perceived to be occurring . Ghulam Ahmad wrote Barahin-e-Ahmadiyya , in 1880 , which incorporated Indian , Sufi , Islamic and Western aspects in order to give life to Islam in the face of the British Raj , Protestant Christianity , and rising Hinduism . He later declared himself the Promised Messiah and the Mahdi following Divine revelations in 1891 . Ghulam Ahmad argued that Jesus had appeared 1300 years after the formation of the Muslim community and stressed the need for a current Messiah , in turn claiming that he himself embodied both the Mahdi and the Messiah . Ghulam Ahmad was supported by Muslims who especially felt oppressed by Christian and Hindu missionaries . Druze faith In the Druze faith , Jesus is considered the Messiah and one of God \\'s important prophets , being among the seven prophets who appeared in different periods of history . According to the Druze manuscripts Jesus is the Greatest Imam and the incarnation of Ultimate Reason ( Akl ) on earth and the first cosmic principle ( Hadd ) , and regards Jesus and Hamza ibn Ali as the incarnations of one of the five great celestial powers , who form part of their system . Druze doctrines include the beliefs that Jesus was born of a virgin named Mary , performed miracles , and died by crucifixion . Druze believe that Hamza ibn Ali was a reincarnation of Jesus , and that Hamza ibn Ali is the true Messiah , who directed the deeds of the messiah Jesus \" the son of Joseph and Mary \" , but when messiah Jesus \" the son of Joseph and Mary \" strayed from the path of the true Messiah , Hamza filled the hearts of the Jews with hatred for him - and for that reason , they crucified him , according to the Druze manuscripts . Despite this , Hamza ibn Ali took him down from the cross and allowed him to return to his family , in order to prepare men for the preaching of his religion . Other religions In Buddhism , Maitreya is considered to the next Buddha ( awakened one ) that is promised to come . He is expected to come to renew the laws of Buddhism once the teaching of Gautama Buddha has completely decayed . Mírzá Ḥusayn-ʻAlí Núrí , founder of the Baháʼí Faith , claimed to be \" He whom God will make manifest \" of the Babi religion . His title Bahá \\' u\\'lláh , when translated literally , means \" The Glory of God \" in Arabic . According to the Baháʼí Faith , Bahá \\' u\\'lláh addressed not only those timeless theological and philosophical questions that have stayed with humanity since old times such as : Who is God ? What is goodness ? and Why are we here ? but also the questions that have preoccupied philosophers of the 20th century : What motivates human nature ? Is real peace indeed possible ? Does God still care for humanity ? and the like . He taught that there is only one God , that all of the world \\'s religions are from God , and that now is the time for humanity to recognize its oneness and unite . Emperor Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia is believed to be the Messiah by followers of the Rastafari movement . This idea further supports the belief that God himself is black , which they ( followers of the Rastafarian movement ) try to further strengthen by a verse from the Bible . Even if the Emperor denied being the messiah , the followers of the Rastafari movement believe that he is a messenger from God . To justify this , Rastafarians used reasons such as Emperor Haile Selassie \\'s bloodline , which is assumed to come from King Solomon of Israel , and the various titles given to him , which include Lord of Lords , King of Kings and Conquering Lion of the tribe of Judah . In Kebatinan ( Javanese religious tradition ) , Satrio Piningit is a character in Jayabaya \\'s prophecies who is destined to become a great leader of Nusantara and to rule the world from Java . In Serat Pararaton , King Jayabaya of Kediri foretold that before the coming of Satrio Piningit , there would be flash floods and that volcanoes would erupt without warning . Satrio Piningit is a Krishna-like figure known as Ratu Adil ( Indonesian : \\'Just King , King of Justice \\' ) and his weapon is a trishula . In Zoroastrianism there are three messiah figures who each progressively bring about the final renovation of the world , the Frashokereti and all of these three figures are called Saoshyant . In Aradia , or the Gospel of the Witches , the messiah is Aradia , daughter of the goddess Diana , who comes to Earth in order to establish the practice of witchcraft before returning to Heaven .

It was used by Bertrand Russell as an illustration of the paradox , though he attributes it to an unnamed person who suggested it to him . The puzzle shows that an apparently plausible scenario is logically impossible . Specifically , it describes a barber who is defined such that he both shaves himself and does not shave himself , which implies that no barber exists . Paradox The barber is the \" one who shaves all those , and those only , who do not shave themselves \" . The question is , does the barber shave himself ? Answering this question results in a contradiction . The barber can not shave himself as he only shaves those who do not shave themselves . Thus , if he shaves himself he ceases to be the barber . Conversely , if the barber does not shave himself , then he fits into the group of people who would be shaved by the barber , and thus , as the barber , he must shave himself . In its original form , this paradox has no solution , as no such barber can exist . The question is a loaded question that assumes the existence of the barber , which is false . There are other non-paradoxical variations , but those are different . History This paradox is often incorrectly attributed to Bertrand Russell ( e.g. , by Martin Gardner in Aha ! ) . It was suggested to Gardner as an alternative form of Russell \\'s paradox , which Russell had devised to show that set theory as it was used by Georg Cantor and Gottlob Frege contained contradictions . However , Russell denied that the Barber \\'s paradox was an instance of his own : This point is elaborated further under Applied versions of Russell \\'s paradox . In first-order logic This sentence says that a barber exists . Its truth value is false , as the existential clause is unsatisfiable ( a contradiction ) because of the universal quantifier . The universal quantifier will include every single element in the domain , including our infamous barber . So when the value is assigned to , the sentence in the universal quantifier can be rewritten to , which is an instance of the contradiction . Since the sentence is false for that particular value , the entire universal clause is false . Since the existential clause is a conjunction with one operand that is false , the entire sentence is false . Another way to show this is to negate the entire sentence and arrive at a tautology . Nobody is a barber , so there is no solution to the paradox .

Double agentry may be practised by spies of the target organization who infiltrate the controlling organization or may result from the turning ( switching sides ) of previously loyal agents of the controlling organization by the target . The threat of execution is the most common method of turning a captured agent ( working for an intelligence service ) into a double agent ( working for a foreign intelligence service ) or a double agent into a re-doubled agent . It is unlike a defector , who is not considered an agent as agents are in place to function for an intelligence service and defectors are not , but some consider that defectors in place are agents until they have defected . Double agents are often used to transmit disinformation or to identify other agents as part of counter-espionage operations . They are often very trusted by the controlling organization since the target organization will give them true , but useless or even counterproductive , information to pass along . Double agents Re-doubled agent A re-doubled agent is an agent who gets caught as a double agent and is forced to mislead the foreign intelligence service . F.M . Begoum describes the redoubled agent as \" one whose duplicity in doubling for another service has been detected by his original sponsor and who has been persuaded to reverse his affections again \" . Vitaly Yurchenko Triple agent A triple agent is a spy who pretends to be a double agent for one side , while they are truthfully a double agent for the other side . Unlike a re-doubled agent , who changes allegiance due to being compromised , a triple agent is usually considered to have been always loyal to their original side . It may also refer to a spy who works for three opposing sides , such that each side thinks the spy works for them alone . Notable triple agents include : Katrina Leung Humam Khalil Abdul Razak Hussein Ibrahim Ismail Events in which double agents played an important role Babington plot Battle of Lexington Battle of Normandy Camp Chapman attack Cold War Duquesne Spy Ring Gukurahundi Stormontgate Vietnam War War on Terrorism Yom Kippur War See also References Further reading External links F .

Gallen in Switzerland . It is the home of a famous natural spring and is a popular spa and health resort destination . History Bad Ragaz is first mentioned circa 843 as Ragaces . As plain Ragaz , the locality was originally a farming village . It had over the centuries a certain importance owing to its position on the north-south route between Germany and Italy . Its history was closely linked to that of the Benedictine Pfäfers Abbey , an important monastery dating back perhaps to the eighth century , which was the dominant landholder around the village and the principal rights holder . The residence of the Prince Abbot of Pfäfers , a building known as the Hof Ragaz served as the premises of the local governor or Statthalter , a position exercised by the Abbey . One of the most notable events in the local chronicles is the Battle of Ragaz , an episode in the Old Zürich War of the years 1440–1446 fought between the canton of Zurich and the other seven cantons of the Old Swiss Confederacy over which of them should inherit the interests and lands of Count Friedrich VII of Toggenburg , who had died in 1438 without intestate and heirless . The armed clash took place at Ragaz on 6 March 1446 . The village suffered over time from the outbreak of several fires and also from flooding which struck , for example , in 1750 , 1762 and 1868 . However , in the nineteenth century there was an upturn in local fortunes . Financial struggles had prompted the last Abbot of Pfäfers , Plazidus Pfister , to request that Pope Gregory XVI secularize the abbey , a request that was granted on 20 March 1838 . On 20 November 1838 . The Canton of St . Gallen then took over the Abbey \\'s estates , including the local hot springs , which began to be increasingly exploited for tourism thanks to a project connecting the springs with the village . This was to lead eventually , in 1937 , to a change of name to Bad Bagaz , and increasing orientation of the local economy towards catering for health spa clientel . It was in Ragaz that around the year 1880 the Swiss novelist and author of children \\'s stories , Johanna Spyri ( 1827-1901 ) , penned the engaging story of Heidi , a 5-year-old girl living with her grandfather in the Swiss Alps . Written , as the title page announced , to be a book \" for children and those who love children \" , it become known throughout the world . Modern day Ragaz is also proud of the fact that it was the retreat where the Bohemian-Austrian poet and author Rainer Maria Rilke ( 1875-1926 ) towards the end of his life reputedly wrote part of his poetic work the Duineser Elegien ( Duino Elegies ) , in particular the seventh Elegy with its famous lines Hiersein ist herrlich ...

He is the current manager of Real Madrid Castilla , the reserve team of La Liga club Real Madrid . Raúl is considered one of the most important players in the history of Real Madrid and regarded as one of the greatest Spanish players of all-time and also one of the best forwards ever . Raúl was born in the San Cristóbal de los Ángeles neighborhood of Madrid where he played for the local youth team before moving to the Atlético Madrid youth team . He later moved to Real Madrid \\'s youth academy and played at its various levels . In 1994 , he signed his first professional contract with the fourth division team Real Madrid C , and then was swiftly promoted to the first team . He spent 16 years of his career playing for Real Madrid and is the club \\'s second all-time top goalscorer with 323 goals and has the most appearances in the history of the club , with 741 . With Los Blancos , Raúl won six La Liga titles , three UEFA Champions League titles , scoring in two finals , four Supercopa de España titles , one UEFA Super Cup and two Intercontinental Cups . In 2003 , he was appointed captain of the team and retained the position until he left the club in 2010 . He then signed for Schalke 04 , where he won a DFB-Pokal and DFL-Supercup , before signing for Qatari club Al Sadd in 2012 , where he won the league and the Emir of Qatar Cup . He ended his career with New York Cosmos in 2015 , after winning a domestic treble . Raúl is the fifth-highest goalscorer in the history of La Liga with 228 goals . He is also the highest Spanish scorer in European leagues , with 256 goals , scoring 228 goals in La Liga and 28 goals in the Bundesliga .

Although he did not win any major competitions while playing for the Spain national team , he scored a then-record 44 goals in 102 appearances for la Roja , appearing in three FIFA World Cups and two European championships . Raúl took over the captaincy of the side in 2002 and held it until 2006 , the year in which he played his last international match . Raúl was named the top international goalscorer in the world by International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 1999 , and ranked second in the 2001 Ballon d\\'Or and third in the 2001 FIFA World Player of the Year . In 2004 , he was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world \\'s greatest living players , and was included in the UEFA list of the 50-best European players of the 1954–2004 period . He was part of the European Team of the Year of European Sports Media in 1997 , 1999 and 2000 . Raúl won two Pichichi trophies ( 1999 and 2001 ) , the top goalscorer award of the UEFA Champions League ( 2000 and 2001 ) , five Don Balón Awards ( 1997 , 1999 , 2000 , 2001 and 2002 ) and one Best Player Award at the Intercontinental Cup in 1998 . Club career Youth clubs Raúl \\'s career began at his local team CD San Cristóbal de los Ángeles playing for their Alevín team and the Infantil the next season . He signed with Atlético Madrid \\'s Infantil team and won a national title with the Cadete team the following season . Following Atlético \\'s then-president Jesús Gil decision to close their youth academy as a cost-saving measure , Raúl moved on to Real Madrid \\'s Cadete team in La Fábrica . The following season , he was promoted to the Juvenil C team and subsequently went on to play for their Juvenil B and Juvenil A team . While with the Real youth set-up , Raúl won the Dallas Cup in 1993 and 1994 . Real Madrid He started his professional career in the 1994–95 season with Real Madrid C . He scored 16 goals in just nine games ( including five in one match against CD Corralejo ) and was swiftly promoted to the first team by coach Jorge Valdano , replacing Emilio Butragueño in a symbolic \" passing of the crown . \" He became the youngest player – 17 years and 124 days – ever to play for the senior side , though the record was broken by Alberto Rivera later that same season . On 29 October 1994 , in an away game against Real Zaragoza at La Romareda , he created a goal for strike partner Iván Zamorano , heralding the demise of Butragueño in the process . The next week , Raúl scored his first goal in his second senior game on a home debut against Madrid rivals and former youth club Atlético Madrid in a bitter derby match . Fully establishing himself as a fixture in the first team , Raúl registered a total of nine goals in 28 appearances to help Real Madrid win the 1994–95 league championship in his first season . With Real Madrid , he won several honours , including further La Liga titles in 1996–97 ( scoring 21 La Liga goals ) , 2000–01 ( scoring 24 La Liga goals ) , and 2002–03 ( scoring 16 La Liga goals in a campaign truncated by a bout of appendicitis for which Raúl was hospitalised ) . During the period from 1998 to 2002 , Raúl and Real Madrid also won three UEFA Champions League trophies in 1998 , 2000 , and 2002 . For most of this time , Raúl struck up a prolific scoring partnership with Fernando Morientes and later Ronaldo . During a La Liga game against fierce rivals Barcelona at the Nou Camp in October 1999 , Raúl silenced the hostile home crowd of almost 100,000 fans when he scored and then memorably celebrated his goal by putting a finger to his lips as though to tell them to be quiet . Raúl took over the captaincy of Real Madrid when Fernando Hierro was transferred in 2003 , a responsibility he held until leaving the club in 2010 . Despite appearing in two finals , in 2002 ( in which he scored ) and 2004 , Raúl never lifted the Copa del Rey . He became the first player to score 50 Champions League goals when he scored in a 2–1 group stage win over Olympiacos on 28 September 2005 , and was also the first to make 100 appearances in the competition . He was also the first player to score in two Champions League finals , since the competition was renamed , scoring in the finals of both 2000 against Valencia in the Stade de France , Saint-Denis , and 2002 against Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park , Glasgow . Raúl holds the distinction of having never been sent off in his 17 years at the professional level . On 11 November 2008 , Raúl scored his 300th goal for Real Madrid with a hat-trick against Real Unión , with Real winning the match 4–3 but being eliminated on away goals after drawing 6–6 on aggregate . In total , Raúl scored 323 goals for Real Madrid , breaking the long-standing club record of Alfredo Di Stéfano ( 307 ) with a volleyed goal against Sporting de Gijón on 15 February 2009 . He is presently fifth on the all-time list of La Liga goalscorers , behind Argentine Lionel Messi , Portuguese Cristiano Ronaldo , Spaniard Telmo Zarra and Mexican Hugo Sánchez . Raúl and fellow long-serving teammate Iker Casillas were both awarded \" contracts for life \" in 2008 , the terms of which stipulated that the contracts would be renewed annually for as long as they played 30 matches each season . On 23 September 2009 , Raúl equalled Manolo Sanchís \\' league appearance record for Real Madrid , and is second in La Liga behind Andoni Zubizarreta , who played in 622 matches . Along with years of captaincy for both Real Madrid and Spain , Raúl was known as \" El Capitan \" ( \" The Captain \" ) . Raúl \\'s last touch with the ball as a Real Madrid player before an injury ruled him out of action for the rest of that season was to score his last goal , the opening goal scored on 24 April 2010 in a 2–1 away victory against Real Zaragoza in La Romareda , coincidentally the stadium where he made his debut in 1994 . It was scored in the 50th minute after Raúl ( himself only on the pitch as a substitute for Rafael van der Vaart after 15 minutes ) had signalled he could not physically continue and was prepared to be substituted off for Karim Benzema one minute after the goal . Before the substitution could be made , Real Madrid launched a counter-attack to create a goal . Though Raúl ran to a slow hobble , he shuffled into the box and was able to poke the ball from Cristiano Ronaldo \\'s pass . Having spent the rest of the season recovering from that injury , the club confirmed on 25 July 2010 that Raúl would be leaving the club , a day after his teammate Guti confirmed he was also leaving after a 15-year spell . Schalke 04 Raúl signed a two-year contract with Schalke 04 on 28 July 2010 . Schalke head coach Felix Magath hailed the signing and told the club website , \" It \\'s great news for FC Schalke 04 , I am pleased that we have succeeded in signing such an exceptional footballer and world-class striker switching to the Bundesliga for Schalke 04 . \" Raúl chose Schalke because they qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Champions League . Raúl scored his first goal for the club during his first match on 1 August 2010 with a brace in a 3–1 victory over Bayern Munich in the final match of the pre-season competition LIGA total ! Cup 2010 . One week later , he made his competitive debut in the 2010 DFL-Supercup on 7 August 2010 again against Bayern , but this time he failed to score in the 2–0 defeat . Raúl made his Bundesliga debut on 21 August 2010 in a 2–1 defeat against Hamburger SV . and scored his first goal for Schalke in the Bundesliga against Borussia Mönchengladbach on 25 September 2010 in a 2–2 draw . After a quiet start , he rediscovered his goalscoring form in the Bundesliga with a brace against FC St . Pauli on 5 November in a 3–0 win , and on 20 November , he scored his first hat-trick for the club in a 4–0 win over Werder Bremen . On 18 December , he scored his second hat-trick for Schalke in a 3–0 win against 1 . FC Köln . Raúl scored another crucial goal on 2 March 2011 in a 1–0 victory over Bayern Munich in the semi-final of 2010–11 DFB-Pokal . After being absent for six years , Schalke ultimately reached the finals since 2005 . In the final match , they played against MSV Duisburg , the first 2 . Bundesliga team which reached the final since 2004 . Raúl never won a domestic cup with Real Madrid ( the Copa del Rey ) , but on 21 May 2011 , in his first season , he finally won a domestic cup and got his maiden trophy with his new club . They won the tournament with a 5–0 win at the Olympiastadion in Berlin . This success was followed with victory two months later on 23 July 2011 in the 2011 DFL-Supercup against the league champions and rivals Borussia Dortmund . In European play , Raúl has since become the highest goal scorer in all UEFA competitions with 73 goals , ahead of Milan veteran Filippo Inzaghi with 70 goals . He scored 71 goals in the Champions League ( 66 goals with Real Madrid and five with Schalke 04 ) and in addition his two goals with Los Blancos , one goal in the 2000 UEFA Super Cup and the other one in the 1998 Intercontinental Cup . On 22 October 2010 , Raúl scored twice against Hapoel Tel Aviv in a 3–1 win , which tied him with German legend Gerd Müller for the most European goals . Raúl fully broke this record on 15 February 2011 on his return to Spain with a crucial away goal in the round of 16 tie against Valencia at the Mestalla Stadium in a 1–1 draw . In the quarter-finals , Raúl scored two goals against Internazionale : one goal in the first leg , a 5–2 away win at the San Siro , and one in the second leg , a 2–1 home win at the Veltins-Arena . Schalke progressed to the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in their history , where they played against Manchester United . Schalke lost the first match 2–0 , which was their first home defeat this season in the tournament , and lost again 4–1 in Old Trafford . Despite the defeat , Raúl considered it an honour that he had swapped shirts with Ryan Giggs . On 19 November 2011 , he captained Schalke for the first time due to an injury to Benedikt Höwedes in a 4–0 home win against 1 . FC Nürnberg . He also scored the second goal and assisted the fourth in that match . Raúl scored another hat-trick against Werder Bremen on 17 December 2011 . The goals came in a 5–0 win that cemented Schalke \\'s position in third place going into the winter break . On 19 February 2012 , he scored the 400th goal of his career ; at that time he had scored 323 with Real Madrid , 44 with Spain and 33 with Schalke . On 5 April 2012 , in the second leg of the UEFA Europa League match against Athletic Bilbao , he scored his 77th goal in a European competition . At a press conference on 19 April 2012 , Raúl announced he would leave Schalke after his contract expired in June , and that \" [ his ] future is not in Europe \" . Raúl had such an impact at Schalke that , on his departure , the club opted to retire the number 7 shirt for an indefinite period . However , in 2013 , the number 7 shirt was given to Max Meyer , Schalke \\'s new prodigy . Al Sadd On 12 May 2012 , it was announced Raúl had signed a deal with Qatari side Al Sadd for the 2012–13 Qatar Stars League season . He played his first competitive match for the club on 5 August in the 2012 Sheikh Jassem Cup , scoring a penalty in extra time in order to secure a 2–0 win against Mesaimeer .

In total , he scored 17 goals at the various youth levels for Spain . With the senior team , Raúl went on for many years to score a national record 44 goals in 102 caps for Spain .

On 5 June , against the same opponents in Villarreal , he was again on target in a 9–0 rout . Raúl played every minute of Spain \\'s Euro 2000 finals campaign in Belgium and the Netherlands . He scored the first goal in their 2–1 win over Slovenia at the Amsterdam Arena .

Managerial career Real Madrid U15s On 17 August 2018 , Raúl was appointed youth coach at Real Madrid , taking charge of the Cadete B ( under-15 ) squad . Real Madrid Castilla On 20 June 2019 , he was appointed manager of Real Madrid Castilla . He began the season with three wins , five draws , and five losses . Style of play A prolific goalscorer and a highly creative forward , Raúl is regarded as one of the greatest and most consistent forwards of his generation . Wearing the number 7 jersey for most of his club and international career , he was capable of playing anywhere along the front line , although he was primarily deployed as a centre-forward , or as a supporting striker . Raúl was a quick , left-footed player , who was capable of scoring both in and outside the penalty area with his accurate and powerful shot , and had a penchant for scoring goals from chips . He possessed excellent ball control and technical ability , and was effective in the air as well . Although primarily renowned for prolific goalscoring , Raúl was also a highly creative and hardworking player , capable of playing off of his teammates , creating chances and assisting goals , and was occasionally deployed as an attacking midfielder in his later career . In addition to these characteristics , Raúl is remembered for his leadership and discipline – throughout his extensive career , he never received a red card , and he was rarely booked . For his technical skills , elegance , goalscoring and performances , he was nicknamed \" El Ferrari \" , or \" The Ferrari , \" by compatriot Fernando Hierro , another emblematic Real Madrid player . He was also an accurate penalty taker . In 2013 , former England centre-back Rio Ferdinand praised Raúl for his clever movement off the ball , and his ability to exploit gaps or draw out defenders in order to create space for his teammates \\' runs , describing him as : \" the most intelligent player [ he \\'d ] played against . \" Media Raúl has been sponsored by German sportswear company Adidas during his career and has appeared in Adidas commercials . He has advertised Adidas Predator football boots , and in 2004 he starred in an Adidas commercial featuring a number of other stars on mopeds , including Zinedine Zidane , Michael Ballack , Alessandro Del Piero and David Trezeguet . Raúl has featured in Pepsi commercials , including an advertisement for the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan where he lined up alongside players including David Beckham , Roberto Carlos and Gianluigi Buffon in taking on a team of Sumo players . Raúl features in EA Sports \\' FIFA video game series . His regular goal celebration of kissing the ring finger – a show of affection to his wife – appears in FIFA 18 . Personal life Throughout his career , Raúl \\'s goal celebration consisted of kissing his wedding ring as an acknowledgment to his wife Mamen Sanz , whom he married in 1999 and with whom he has four sons and a daughter : Jorge , Hugo , twins Héctor and Mateo , and María . Jorge and Hugo are both footballers ; Jorge at Fordham Preparatory School in New York City , and Hugo in New York City FC \\'s academy .

Noddy first appeared in a book series published between 1949 and 1963 , illustrated by the Dutch artist Harmsen van der Beek from 1949 until his death in 1953 , after which the work was continued by Peter Wienk . Television shows based on the character have run on British television since 1955 . Noddy The first book explains Noddy \\'s origins . He is made by a woodcarver in a toy store but runs away after the man begins to make a wooden lion , which scares Noddy . As he wanders through the woods naked , penniless , and homeless , he meets Big Ears , a friendly brownie . Big Ears decides that Noddy is a toy and takes him to live in Toyland . He generously provides Noddy with a set of clothing and a house . While Noddy is quite happy to be a toy , the citizens of Toyland are not sure that he actually is one . They put Noddy on trial and examine whether he is a toy or an ornament . Eventually , Noddy is declared a toy , but still has to convince the court that he is a good toy . The judge accepts that Noddy is good after a doll tells the court that he saved her little girl from a lion , and he is allowed to stay in Toyland . Noddy gets his car in the second book . It is given to him after he helps solve a local mystery . The other toys can hear him coming by the distinctive \" Parp Parp \" sound of his car \\'s horn and the jingle of the bell on his blue hat . Often he uses his car to visit all of the places in Toyland . When his taxi business is not doing so well , or when he needs help , Noddy turns to Big Ears . Big Ears will often lend him what he needs . On occasion , Noddy will allow people to make his head nod , in exchange for small items such as his morning milk . Noddy is kind and honest , but he often gets into trouble , either through his own misunderstandings or because someone , usually one of the naughty goblins Sly or Gobbo , has played a trick on him . He is very childlike in his understanding of the world and often becomes confused as a result . For example , in the first Noddy book , Noddy and Big Ears are building Noddy \\'s house for one . Noddy suggests that they build the roof first , in case it rains . With no understanding of gravity or of the need for roof supports , this is perfectly logical to him . As the series continues , Noddy becomes wiser but without losing his charm and lovable naivety . Noddy \\'s best friends are Big Ears , Tessie Bear , Bumpy Dog , and the Tubby Bears . Big Ears , who brought Noddy to Toyland , is the most important figure in his life . Whenever he faces serious peril , it tends to be Big Ears who comes to the rescue , one way or another , and it is invariably Big Ears to whom Noddy turns for support and reassurance . Big Ears is not so much a parental figure , but more like a guardian , or perhaps Noddy \\'s attorney . While kind to Noddy , Big Ears has an intimidating presence and voice that makes him feared by goblins . He is capable of facing down wizards with his own spells , and is able to plead Noddy \\'s case to Mr . Plod , the local policeman , when Noddy finds himself in legal peril . On rare occasions , however , Big Ears finds himself in trouble , in which case Noddy comes to his aid . Big Ears and Noddy have rarely quarreled seriously . Examples of such quarrels are when Big Ears harshly scolded the very sensitive Tessie Bear for failing to control her dog and when Noddy ran his car into Big Ears \\'s clothes post and then drove away , dragging Big Ears \\'s clean washing behind him . Tessie is a gentle-hearted , gold bear who often wears a bonnet with flowers and a skirt . She is young like Noddy , and very loving towards all of her friends and neighbours . Bumpy Dog is Tessie \\'s pet . He loves to run up and \" bump \" people over . Noddy frequently gets annoyed with Bumpy but still likes him . Whenever Noddy threatens Bumpy , Tessie gets upset , and sometimes even begins to cry . The Tubby Bears live next door to Noddy . They are gold and chubby teddy bears . Mr . and Mrs . Tubby Bear frequently help Noddy . It is clear that Mr . and Mrs . Tubby Bear are the superiors of Noddy , as if he were a child . Their first names are never mentioned and Noddy always refers to them as Mr . and Mrs . They have one son , also named Tubby , who is occasionally referred to as Master Tubby . Tubby is naughty and is usually in trouble for breaking rules , being rude , or doing something wrong . Noddy often attempts to scold or punish Tubby , with little result . On one occasion , Tubby gets tired of always being bossed around and being punished and decides to run away to sea . Noddy and Bumpy accidentally join with him . By the end of the journey , Tubby misses his parents and brings them back presents from his trip , as an apology . Noddy has many run-ins with Mr . Plod . Some are caused by Noddy \\'s lack of understanding of how Toyland works . Other times it is because of a case of mistaken identity , Mr . Plod is generally long-suffering towards Noddy and Noddy likes Mr . Plod and frequently goes out of his way to help him . Mr . Plod often catches the mischief makers on his police bicycle , by blowing his whistle and shouting \" Halt in the name of Plod ! ! \" before locking the culprits up in his jail . Inspiration It is said that Enid Blyton took inspiration for Noddy from the village of Studland in Dorset where she would holiday virtually every summer . A small copse nearby was said to be Noddy \\'s Wood . PC Christopher Rhone whom Blyton met while he was on the beat came to be immortalised as PC Plod in the Noddy books , and the national archetype of a flatfooted copper . Characters Major characters Tessie Bear , a clever young female teddy bear who is Noddy \\'s best friend . She was instead replaced by a female panda named Pat-Pat . Big Ears , a wise , bearded brownie who lives in a toadstool house outside of Toyland and is Noddy \\'s helper and father figure . He finds Noddy and brings him to Toyland at the start of the first book . Big Ears , while usually kind to Noddy , can be very fierce and is both feared and respected by goblins , wizards , and even Mr . Plod . Whenever Noddy is being mistreated , he invariably comes to his defence . Big Ears also has the power to cast magic spells , though he rarely uses it . His catchphrase is \" You funny little Noddy ! \" He is referred to as a gnome in the 2002 computer-animated television series Make Way for Noddy . Dinah Doll , a china doll who sells all kinds of everything in the market . A later addition , not in the original books . Mr . Plod ( sometimes called PC Plod ) , the Toyland policeman . He has an uneven relationships with Noddy , who he thinks drives too fast and engages in other unwarranted behaviour . He has gone so far as to imprison Noddy at least once , and threatened him with imprisonment on other occasions . His catchphrase is \" Stop in the name of Plod ! \" Bumpy Dog , in the original books . lives with Tessie Bear , but accompanies Noddy on many adventures . Noddy first met the Bumpy Dog in Toytown because he was injured and Noddy used his scarf to help him . Noddy felt he was unable to have Bumpy Dog live with him , so Tessie Bear offered to keep him . Sly and Gobbo , mischievous goblins . They usually steal things such as ice cream , coins or Noddy \\'s car . They do not appear or at least not nearly as much in Enid Blyton \\'s original books . Recurring characters Mr . Wobblyman , a funny little man who can not lie down . He has a round base which he wobbles about on . He rocks back and forth to get around .

Tubby Bear \\'s son . and is sometimes called Bruiny . He was naughty in the books and older television series , but he was better behaved in Make Way for Noddy . Mr .

Sneaky and Stealthy , Sly and Gobbo \\'s cousins , who appear in later versions of the television show . Noddy books Early Noddy books have become collectibles , along with other Blytons . The total number is hard to count : the Noddy Library ( Sampson Low ) of two dozen titles , which became the New Noddy Library when revised , was just part of a big production in the 1950s , with Big Noddy Books of larger format , and strip books . There were numerous spin-offs , also . Widely differing estimates can be found . The 24 original Noddy books by Enid Blyton were published between 1949 and 1963 . Harmsen Van der Beek illustrated the first 7 Noddy books . After Beek \\'s death in 1953 the original style was maintained by illustrators Robert Tyndall , Peter Wienk , Mary Brooks and Robert Lee . Sales of Noddy books are large , with an estimated 600,000 annual sales in France alone , and growing popularity in India , a large market for Blyton books .

Karen Briffett reprised her role as Noddy and Big Ears was played by Jonathan Broxholme . This production was too presented by Clarion Productions . The characters returned between September 2002 and January 2004 for a computer-animated series , which was eventually named Make Way for Noddy .

It originally aired in 12-minute segments as part of the Milkshake ! programme on Britain \\'s Channel 5 . In the autumn of 2004 , a set of 100 new two-minute TV interstitials were created by Chorion . These interstitials , entitled Say it With Noddy , feature Noddy learning words in a variety of foreign languages . They also introduced Noddy \\'s new friend Whizz from Robot Village , who presses a button on his chest to play recordings of native speakers saying the new foreign words Noddy was to learn .

Other media There was a spoof page of \" Noddy-ana \" in Hot Rod magazine ( U.K. ) , in about 1976–1978 ; Noddy had a hot rod , and Big Ears smoked , and was very disrespectful to Mr . Plod . In the book Seven Deadly Wonders by Matthew Reilly , a character is nicknamed Noddy , while his best friend \\'s nickname is Big Ears . IDW \\'s The Transformers introduced the character of \" Tappet \" , a robot who is based on Noddy visually and clearly transforms into Noddy \\'s classic car . The puppet of Big Ears from the 1955–1963 Noddy television series appeared as a member of the \" Puppet Government \" in The Goodies episode \" The Goodies Rule – O.K. ? \" .

Smiler is dressed as Noddy complete with a smaller version of his car in order to tow a bouncy castle with the rest of the characters on it , but it deflated while they were taking part . Derivative uses Noddy being associated with small children \\'s reading has led to \" Noddy \" being sometimes used as an adjective meaning \" petty or trivial \" ( compare with \" Mickey Mouse \" ) , for example , in computer programming : \" This simultaneous linear equation subroutine crashes out on the Noddy case when n = 1 , but otherwise it works . \" or \" Remember to check all the Noddy cases . \" In Britain the word plod became a derogatory term to describe a police officer due to the success of the Noddy franchise , and its character PC Plod . For example somebody could say , “ I ’ m not having a good morning , I was driving to work this morning and got pulled over by the plod for driving too fast ” See also Toytown was a BBC radio series for children , broadcast for Children \\'s Hour on the Home Service from 1929 .

Bhavani translates to \" giver of life \" , meaning the power of nature or the source of creative energy . She is considered to be a mother who provides to her devotees and also plays the role of dispensing justice by killing Asuras . Bhavani was the protective patron deity of the Maratha King Shivaji , in whose veneration he dedicated his sword , Bhavani Talwar . Many Marathi folk stories celebrate her . Shivaji \\'s mother was said to be a great devotee of Bhavani . The town of Tuljapur in Maharashtra is the location of the annual Tulja Bhavani fair during Navaratri ( September to October ) , and home to the Tulja Bhavani Temple which dates to the 12th century . The temple contains a granite icon of the goddess , one metre ( approximately 3 feet ) in height , with eight arms holding weapons and the head of the slain demon Mahishasura . Etymology The word Bhavānī translates to \" giver of life \" , meaning the power of nature or the source of creative energy . She is an aspect of Parvati and considered to be a mother who provides to her devotees and also plays the role of dispensing justice by killing Asuras . According to the Śiva Purāṇa , Bhavānī is the supreme goddess and the consort of Lord Bhava ( Sadasiva ) . Bhavānī ( भवानि , “ the giver of existence ” ) .—One of the names of the Goddess , Devī , who is regarded as the female principle of the divine ; the embodiment of the energies of the Gods . Bhavānī ( भवानी ) is an epithet of the Goddess ( Devī ) , who incarnated as Satī , according to the Śivapurāṇa 2.2.14 . Accordingly , as Brahmā narrated to Nārada : — “ [ ... ] On seeing the mother of the universe born of Vīriṇī , Dakṣa joined his palms in reverence , paid respects to her , and eulogized her . [ ... ] O mother of the universe , those who eulogize Thee with the names of Bhavānī , Ambikā , Jaganmāyā and Durgā will have everything ” . The Goddess has a great variety of names referable to her various forms , attributes , and actions but these names are not always used accurately and distinctively . As the mother of the world , she is Gauri , Ambikā or Jagaṭ Jananī ( the reading Jagaṭ Jananī/Jaga Jananī for Jaganmāyā is preferable ) . In her fiercer form , she is Durgā , the inaccessible . Temples of Bhavani The Tulja Bhavani temple in Tuljapur in the Osmanabad District of Maharashtra is considered one of the 51 Shakti Pithas ( pilgrimage sites ) . This temple was built close to the 12th century CE . Another Tulja Bhavani temple was constructed between 1537 and 1540 CE in Chittorgarh , located at coordinates History Worship of the primeval energy , Shakti , in the form of the Mother Goddess is seen in the four Shakti Peethas of Maharashtra : Bhavānī , with her seat at Tuljapur ; Mahalakshmi at Kolhapur ; Mahamaya Renuka at Mahur ; and Saptashrungi at Vani . Śrī Bhavānī Amman is also worshipped in the state of Tamil Nadu ( Periyapalayam ) . Other Shakti temples in the Maharashtra state are those at Ambejogai and Aundh . The goddess Bhavānī is held in great reverence throughout Maharashtra . She is considered to be an embodiment of ugra or ferocity , as well as a Karunaswaroopini , an embodiment of mercy . A number of castes , sub-castes , and families from Maharashtra consider her their family deity or Kuladevata . The Bhavani temple in Tuljapur is located on a hill known as Yamunachala , on the slopes of the Sahayadri range in Maharashtra near Solapur . The temple entrance is elevated and visitors ascend a flight of steps to reach the shrine . Historic records speak of the existence of this temple from as early as the 12th century CE . Bhavānī is worshipped in the form of a granite image , tall , with eight arms that hold weapons and one hand in abhayā mūdra ( giving blessings to devotees ) , She kills the demon Mahishasura in 4 different forms which are Katyayani ( 10-armed ) , Mahalakshmi ( 18-armed/1000 armed Devī Ćaṇḍika from Durgā Saptaśatī ) , Ugrachanda ( 18-armed ) and Bhadrakali ( 16-armed ) . Legend says that a demon by the name of Matang wreaked havoc upon the devas and humans , who approached Brahma for help . Upon his advice , they turned to the Mother Goddess Shakti . She took the form of the destroyer and , empowered by the other Saptamātṛka ( Brāhmaṇī , Vaiṣṇavī , Māheśvari , Indrāṇi , Kaumārī , Vārāhī , and Ćāmuṇḍā . ) , vanquished the demon and allowed the restoration of peace . Legend also describes how Bhavānī vanquished another demon who had taken the form of a wild buffalo , Mahishasura ( hence her name Mahishasura Mardhini or \" the slayer of Mahisha the demon \" ) . Later , she is said to have taken abode on the Yamunachala hill , which is now home to the temple . Bhavānī is said to have come here to save Anubhuti from the demon known as Kukur . In a battle with the goddess , Kukur took the form of a buffalo ; Bhavani cut his head , then he started coming in his original form . At that time , she penetrated her trident in his chest . Hence , she is in form of Mahishasura Mardini Durga . Four worship services are offered at the temple each day . The festivals of special significance are Gudi Padwa in the month of Chaitra , Shriral Sashti , Lalita Panchami , Makara Sankranti , and Rathasaptami . The statue of the deity is taken out in procession on Tuesdays . Navaratri is also celebrated with great fanfare , and it culminates in Vijaya Dasami . Sri Bhavani Devi is said to be Adi Parashakti herself and the name Bhavani has several meanings . According to Lalitha Sahasranamam , Bhavānī means the deity who always helps devotees gain mukti . Adi Shankara said , \" A Person who recites the name Bhavani with true devotion thrice every day will not acquire sorrow , sin , illness and unexpected death . \" People occasionally confuse Bhavani devi with Renuka devi ; however , their stories are different.There are many texts which name Bhavani as the wife of Sadasiva . Image of Tulja Bhavani The image ( murti ) of Tulja Bhavani is made of black stone , about in height and in width . The face of the goddess is described as beautiful and smiling . The goddess is asta-bhuja ( with 8 hands ) Durga . Her long hair is coming out of the crown . She has a quiver on her back . The sun and the moon are present . Her lion stands near her .

Although Cowley \\'s plays and poetry did not enjoy wide popularity after the 19th century , critic Melinda Finberg rates her as \" one of the foremost playwrights of the late eighteenth century \" whose \" skill in writing fluid , sparkling dialogue and creating sprightly , memorable comic characters compares favourably with her better-known contemporaries , Goldsmith and Sheridan . \" Cowley \\'s plays were produced frequently in her lifetime . The major themes of her plays – including her first , The Runaway ( 1776 ) , and her major success , which is being revived , The Belle \\'s Stratagem ( 1780 ) – revolve around marriage and how women strive to overcome the injustices imposed by family life and social custom . Early success Born Hannah Parkhouse , she was the daughter of Hannah ( née Richards ) and Philip Parkhouse , a bookseller in Tiverton , Devon . Sources disagree about some details of her married life , citing her marriage date as either 1768 or 1772 and claiming she had either three or four children . Shortly after her marriage to Thomas Cowley , the couple moved to London , where Thomas worked as an official in the Stamp Office and as a part-time journalist . The introduction to her 1813 collected works gives an account of how Cowley was struck by a sudden desire to write while attending a play with her husband . \" So delighted with this ? \" she boasted to him . \" Why I could write as well myself ! \" Thomas teased her , but by the middle of the next day Cowley showed him the first act of her comedy The Runaway . If the substance of the story is true , this visit to the theatre could have occurred no later than 1775 , for the rest of The Runaway was written , sent to the actor-manager David Garrick and produced at Drury Lane theatre by 15 February 1776 . The Runaway enjoyed 17 performances in its first season at Drury Lane and 39 in London by 1800 , a success that encouraged Cowley to write more , though her mentor Garrick retired after the 1776 season . She wrote her next two plays , the farce Who ’ s the Dupe ? and the tragedy Albina , before the year was out . Controversy with Hannah More Who \\'s the Dupe ? and Albina encountered difficulties in production . The new manager of Drury Lane , Richard Brinsley Sheridan , shelved The Runaway for most of the 1777 season . Miffed , Cowley sent Albina to Drury Lane \\'s rival theatre in London , Covent Garden , but it met with no better reception there and the script alternated between the theatres for the next two years . Meanwhile , Sheridan agreed to produce Who \\'s the Dupe ? , but delayed its 1779 première until late spring , an unprofitable time for a new play to open . The production of Albina generated public controversy for Cowley . While this play was bouncing between Drury Lane and Covent Garden , writer Hannah More \\'s plays Percy ( 1777 ) and Fatal Falsehood ( 1779 ) opened at Covent Garden . Watching Percy aroused Cowley \\'s suspicions : Fatal Falsehood confirmed Cowley \\'s belief that More had plagiarised from Albina . As Cowley later wrote in her preface to the printed edition of Albina , hers and More \\'s plays do indeed have \" wonderful resemblances \" . Fatal Falsehood \" \\'s opening on 6 May 1779 , was followed by press charges ( perhaps written by Thomas Cowley ) that More stole her ideas from Cowley . On 10 August , More wrote to the St . James Chronicle to protest that she \" never saw , heard , or read , a single line of Mrs . Cowley \\'s Tragedy . \" In her preface to Albina , Cowley allows that the theatre managers , who in those days doubled as script editors , may have inadvertently given More her ideas : \" Amidst the croud of Plots , and Stage Contrivances , in which a Manager is involv \\'d , recollection is too frequently mistaken for the suggestions of imagination \" [ emphasis in original ] . Although she continued to enjoy a brilliant literary career , More wrote no more for the stage after her paper war with Cowley . Albina finally opened on 31 July 1779 at the Haymarket , a summer theatre more practised in staging comedies . It was neither a financial nor a critical success . Later career With the Hannah More controversy behind her , Cowley wrote her most popular and enduring comedy , The Belle \\'s Stratagem , which was produced at Covent Garden in 1780 . It was performed 28 nights in its first season and 118 times in London before 1800 , a respectable success that consolidated her family \\'s financial position . Her next play , The World as it Goes ; or , a Party at Montpelier ( later entitled Second Thoughts Are Best ) was a flop , but she continued to write until 1794 , seeing seven more plays into production : Which is the Man ? , A Bold Stroke for a Husband , More Ways Than One , A School for Greybeards , or , The Mourning Bride , The Fate of Sparta , or , The Rival Kings , A Day in Turkey , or , The Russian Slaves , and The Town Before You . None of these matched the success of her earlier plays . In 1783 , Thomas Cowley accepted a job with the British East India Company . He moved to India and left Hannah in London to raise their children ; Thomas died there in 1797 , never having returned to England . Cowley \\'s poetry Hannah Cowley had a less distinguished career as a poet , writing The Scottish Village , or Pitcairne Green in 1786 , and The Siege of Acre : an Epic Poem in 1801 . In the summer of 1787 , under the pseudonym \" Anna Matilda , \" she and the poet Robert Merry ( writing as Della Crusca ) began a poetic correspondence in the pages of the journal The World . Their poems were sentimental and flirtatious . At first each did not even know the other \\'s identity ; later they met and became part of a poetic movement called the Della Cruscans . Literary history has not been kind to Della Cruscan poetry , which was criticised as sloppy and emotional . Merry was the subject of a satirical poem , \" The Baviad \" , written by a contemporary , William Gifford . Cowley \\'s poetry was published as The Poetry of Anna Matilda [ pseud . ] Containing A Tale for Jealousy , The Funeral , Her Correspondence with Della Crusca [ pseud . ] and Several Other Poetical Pieces . To Which Are Added Recollections , Printed from an Original Manuscript , Written by General Sir William Waller ( London : J . Bell , 1788 ) . Cowley \\'s last play , The Town Before You \" , was produced in 1795 . In 1801 , Cowley retired to Tiverton , Devon , where she spent her remaining years away from the public spotlight , quietly revising her plays . She died of liver failure in 1809 . Major plays The Runaway ( 1776 ) George Hargrave , who is home from college , is overjoyed to learn that Emily , the mysterious runaway whom his godfather , Mr . Drummond , has taken in , is the same young lady he fell in love with at a recent masquerade . Meanwhile , George \\'s spirited cousin , Bella , helps George \\'s sister , Harriet , and George \\'s friend Sir Charles fall in love . George \\'s designs are threatened when he learns that his father wants George to marry Lady Dinah , a pretentious older lady who is also very rich . When Emily \\'s father arrives to take Emily back to London , George gives chase and snatches Emily back . Mr . Drummond saves the day by offering the young lovers some of his land so that they can have a fortune of their own . Who \\'s the Dupe ? ( 1779 ) Granger , a captain , arrives in town to see his lover , Elizabeth . Her uneducated father , Abraham Doiley , has promised her hand to the most educated man he can find , an unappealing but intelligent scholar named Gradus . Elizabeth \\'s friend Charlotte , who fancies Gradus for herself , persuades Gradus to act more fashionable and less bookish so that he can win Elizabeth \\'s heart . Doiley is not impressed by the new Gradus ; meanwhile , Granger presents himself to Doiley as a scholar so that he can win Elizabeth \\'s hand . Granger and Gradus square off against each other to see who is the more educated , and Granger wins by using phony Greek that nonetheless impresses Doiley . Gradus is consoled by winning Charlotte . Albina ( 1779 ) The powerful Duke of Westmorland learns that the gallant young soldier Edward is in love with his daughter , Albina , who is a young widow to Count Raimond . Despite her love for Edward , Albina \\'s virtue impedes her from agreeing to marry him . Westmorland and Edward persuade her to remarry because Edward is soon destined to go off to war ; she agrees . Editha , who is jealous of Albina , seeks help from Lord Gondibert , Raimond \\'s brother , who secretly loves Albina . On the eve of the wedding , Gondibert tells Edward that Albina has been unfaithful , and to prove it he disguises himself and allows Edward to spy on him sneaking into Albina \\'s chamber at night . Edward then calls off the wedding , and the furious Westmorland challenges him to a duel to protect Albina \\'s honour . Before the duel begins , Gondibert \\'s elderly servant , Egbert , exposes his master \\'s lie , and the king banishes Gondibert . Before he leaves , Gondibert vows to kill Albina and then commit suicide . He sneaks into Albina \\'s chamber and stabs a woman he thinks is Albina , and then he stabs himself . But the woman turns out to be a disguised Editha , who had also stolen into the room . Edward is relieved when the real Albina rushes into the room , and the dying Gondibert asks for and receives her pardon . The Belle \\'s Stratagem ( 1780 ) Having returned from his trip to Europe , the handsome Doricourt meets his betrothed , Letitia . He finds her acceptable but by no means as elegant as European women . Determined that she will not marry without love , Letitia enlists the help of her father , Mr . Hardy , and Mrs . Racket , a widow , to turn Doricourt off the wedding by pretending that she , Letitia , is an unmannerly hoyden . Meanwhile , Doricourt \\'s friend Sir George is being overprotective of his new wife , Lady Frances , who rebels and agrees to accompany Mrs . Racket for a day in the town and a masquerade ball that night . While out at an auction , Lady Frances meets the rake , Courtall , who brags to his friend Saville that he will seduce her . Meanwhile , Letitia \\'s brazen acting succeeds in dissuading Doricourt from wanting to marry her . All characters converge at that night \\'s masquerade . The disguised Letitia shows off her charms , bewitches Doricourt and then leaves before he can find out who she is . Courtall , disguised the same way as Sir George , lures the lady he thinks is Lady Frances back to his house . However , Saville has replaced the real Lady Frances with a prostitute who wears the same disguise as Lady Frances . Shamed , Courtall leaves town .

References Former municipalities of the canton of Neuchâtel', 'A relative clause is typically a clause that modifies a noun or noun phrase , and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase . For example , in the sentence I met a man who was n\\'t there , the subordinate clause who was n\\'t there is a relative clause , since it modifies the noun man , and uses the pronoun who to indicate that the same \" man \" is referred to within the subordinate clause ( in this case , as its subject ) . In many European languages , relative clauses are introduced by a special class of pronouns called relative pronouns , such as who in the example just given . In other languages , relative clauses may be marked in different ways : they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called relativizers ; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant ; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone . In some languages , more than one of these mechanisms may be possible . Types Bound and free A bound relative clause , the type most often considered , qualifies an explicit element ( usually a noun or noun phrase ) appearing in the main clause , and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause . The relative clause may also function as an embedded clause within a main ( or higher-level ) clause , thereby forming a matrix sentence . The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the head noun , or ( particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun ) the antecedent . For example , in the English sentence \" The person whom I saw yesterday went home \" , the relative clause \" whom I saw yesterday \" modifies the head noun person , and the relative pronoun whom refers back to the referent of that noun . The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences : \" I saw a person yesterday . The person went home . \" The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses ; in this example the same person is referred to by the subject of the matrix clause , but the direct object of the relative clause . A free relative clause ( or fused relative ) , on the other hand , does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself . Instead , the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause . For example , in the English sentence \" I like what I see \" , the clause what I see is a free relative clause , because it has no antecedent , but itself serves as the object of the verb like in the main clause . Alternatively , one could argue that the free relative clause has a zero as its antecedent . Restrictive and non-restrictive Bound relative clauses may or may not be restrictive . A restrictive relative clause is a relative clause that functions as a restrictive modifier . A non-restrictive relative clause is a relative clause that is not a restrictive relative clause . Whereas a non-restrictive or non-defining relative clause merely provides supplementary information , a restrictive or defining relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word ( restricts its possible referent ) . For example : The person who lives in this house has not been seen for days . This ( who lives in this house ) is a restrictive relative clause , modifying the meaning of person , and essential to the sentence ( if the clause were omitted , it would no longer be known which person is being referred to ) . If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense . The mayor , who lives in this house , has not been seen for days . This is a non-restrictive relative clause , since it provides supplementary information about the mayor , but is not essential to the sentence—if the clause were omitted , it would still be known which mayor is meant . If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense . In speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses , and in English this is shown in writing by commas ( as in the examples ) . However , many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way . Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with that or use the \" zero \" relative pronoun ( see English relative clauses for details ) . A non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase ; for example : The cat was allowed on the bed , which annoyed the dog . Here , the context of the sentence ( presumably ) indicates that which refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire proposition expressed in the main clause , namely the circumstance in which the cat was allowed on the bed . Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for ambiguity in parsing ; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be The cat \\'s being [ or having been ] allowed on the bed annoyed the dog . Finite and non-finite Relative clauses may be either finite clauses ( as in the examples above ) or non-finite clauses . An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the infinitive clause on whom to rely , in the sentence \" She is the person on whom to rely \" . Formation methods Languages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed : How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause . How the two clauses are joined together . Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun ( in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified ) . For example , the English sentence \" The person that I saw yesterday went home \" can be described as follows : The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by gapping ; that is , a gap is left in the object position after \" saw \" , implying that the shared noun phrase ( \" the person \" ) is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb \" saw \" . The clauses are joined by the complementizer \" that \" . The embedded clause is placed after the head noun \" the person \" . The following sentences indicate various possibilities ( only some of which are grammatical in English ) : \" The person [ that I saw yesterday ] went home \" . ( A complementizer linking the two clauses with a gapping strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause . One possibility in English . Very common cross-linguistically . ) \" The person [ I saw yesterday ] went home \" . ( Gapping strategy , with no word joining the clauses—also known as a reduced relative clause . One possibility in English . Used in Arabic when the head noun is indefinite , as in \" a person \" instead of \" the person \" . ) \" The person [ whom I saw yesterday ] went home \" . ( A relative pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause—in this case , the direct object . Used in formal English , as in Latin , German or Russian . ) \" The person [ seen by me yesterday ] went home \" . ( A reduced relative clause , in this case passivized . One possibility in English . ) \" The person [ that I saw him yesterday ] went home \" . ( A complementizer linking the two sentences with a resumptive pronoun indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause , as in Arabic , Hebrew or Persian . ) \" The person [ that her I saw yesterday ] went home \" . ( Similar to the previous , but with the resumptive pronoun fronted . This occurs in modern Greek and as one possibility in modern Hebrew ; the combination that him of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun . ) \" The [ I saw yesterday ] \\'s person went home \" . ( Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle—as normally used in a genitive construction—to link the relative clause to the head noun . This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from \" relative clause + noun \" > \" nominalized clause + noun \" > \" genitive construction \" . ) \" The [ I saw yesterday ] person went home \" . ( Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word , as in Japanese or Mongolian . ) \" The person [ of my seeing yesterday ] went home \" . ( Nominalized relative clause , as in Turkish . ) \" [ Which person I saw yesterday ] , that person went home \" . ( A correlative structure , as in Hindi . ) \" [ I saw the person yesterday ] went home . \" ( An unreduced , internally headed relative clause , as in Tibetan or Navajo . ) Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause There are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause . These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced , from most to least : Gap strategy or gapped relative clause Relative pronoun Pronoun retention Nonreduction Gapped relative clause In this strategy , there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go . This is normal in English , for example , and also in Chinese and Japanese . This is the most common type of relative clause , especially in verb-final languages with prenominal relative clauses , but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses . There may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses . ( Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap , since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun . ) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized , as in Turkish and in English reduced relative clauses . In non-verb-final languages , apart from languages like Thai and Vietnamese with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars , gapped relative clauses tend , however , to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy . With obliques and genitives , non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention . English is unusual in that all roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping : e.g . \" I saw the person who is my friend \" , but also ( in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically , according to the accessibility hierarchy described below ) \" ... who I know \" , \" ... who I gave a book to \" , \" ... who I spoke with \" , \" ... who I run slower than \" . Usually , languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy , and switch to a different strategy at this point . Classical Arabic , for example , only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object ; beyond that , a resumptive pronoun must be used . Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point—e.g . in many Austronesian languages , such as Tagalog , all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause . In these languages , relative clauses with shared nouns serving \" disallowed \" roles can be expressed by passivizing the embedded sentence , thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position . This , for example , would transform \" The person who I gave a book to \" into \" The person who was given a book by me \" . Generally , languages such as this \" conspire \" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from all positions — hence a sentence equivalent to \" The person who is run slower than by me \" is grammatical . Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns ( since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause ) , but this is not necessary ( e.g . Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer ) . Relative pronoun type This is in fact a type of gapped relative clause , but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker ( the relative pronoun ) used to join the main and embedded clauses . All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position : though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position , they are unknown . Some languages have what are described as \" relative pronouns \" ( in that they agree with some properties of the head noun , such as number and gender ) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause . Classical Arabic in fact has \" relative pronouns \" which are case-marked , but which agree in case with the head noun . Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to European languages , where they are widespread except among the Celtic family and Indo-Aryan family . The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of Native American languages , of which the best known are the Keresan languages . Pronoun retention type In this type , the position relativized is indicated by means of a personal pronoun in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause—known as a resumptive pronoun . It is equivalent to saying \" The woman who I saw her yesterday went home \" . Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy . In Persian and Classical Arabic , for example , resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object , and optional in the case of the direct object . Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final languages of Africa and Asia , and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and Romanian ( \" Omul pe care l-am văzut ieri a mers acasă \" / \" The man who I saw him yesterday went home \" ) . They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English , as in \" That \\'s the girl that I do n\\'t know what she did \" , although this is sometimes considered non-standard . Only a very small number of languages , of which the best known is Yoruba , have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause . Nonreduction type In the nonreduction type , unlike the other three , the shared noun occurs as a full-fledged noun phrase in the embedded clause , which has the form of a full independent clause . Typically , it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing . Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun . These languages are said to have internally headed relative clauses , which would be similar to the ( ungrammatical ) English structure \" [ You see the girl over there ] is my friend \" or \" I took [ you see the girl over there ] out on a date \" . This is used , for example , in Navajo , which uses a special relative verb ( as with some other Native American languages ) . A second strategy is the correlative-clause strategy used by Hindi and other Indo-Aryan languages , as well as Bambara . This strategy is equivalent to saying \" Which girl you see over there , she is my daughter \" or \" Which knife I killed my friend with , the police found that knife \" . It is \" correlative \" because of the corresponding \" which ... that ... \" demonstratives or \" which ... she/he/it ... \" pronouns , which indicate the respective nouns being equated . The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun . There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence . For example , in the second example above , Hindi would actually say something equivalent to \" I killed my friend with which knife , the police found that knife \" . Dialects of some European languages , such as Italian , do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as \" The person just passed us by , she introduced me to the chancellor here . \" In general , however , nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages , though it is more common among those that are head-marking . Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause The following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses : Use of an indeclinable particle ( specifically , a relativizer ) inserted into the sentence , placed next to the modified noun ; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position , typically placed on the other side of the complementizer . This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word that ( \" the woman that I saw \" ) , though this interpretation of \" that \" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial ( see below ) . In the modern varieties of Arabic ( using illi placed after the modified noun ) ; in Chinese ( using de placed before the modified noun ) . Use of a relative pronoun . Prototypically , a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender , number , definiteness , animacy , etc. , but adopts the case that the shared noun assumes in the embedded , not matrix , clause . This is the case in a number of conservative European languages , such as Latin , German and Russian . Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed \" relative pronouns \" that agree in some way with the head noun , but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause . In English , for example , the use of who vs . which agrees with the animacy of the head noun , but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast who vs . whom . Similarly , in Classical Arabic , there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number , gender , definiteness and case with the head noun ( rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause ) . Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause , since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case . ( Classical Arabic , where the case marking indicates something else , uses a resumptive pronoun . ) Some linguists prefer to use the term relative pronoun only for the prototypical cases ( but in this case it is unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases ) . Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position , with no word used to join them . This is common , for example , in English ( cf . \" The person I saw yesterday went home \" ) , and is used in Classical Arabic in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns . By nominalizing the relative clause ( e.g . converting it to a participial construction ) . Generally , no relative pronoun or complementizer is used . This occurs , for example , in reduced relative clauses in English ( e.g . \" The person seen by me yesterday went home \" or \" The person planning to go home soon is my friend \" ) . Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses , which can become extremely long . This is also the normal strategy in Turkish , which has sentences equivalent to \" I ate the potato of Hasan \\'s giving to Sina \" ( in place of \" I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina \" ) . This can be viewed as a situation in which the \" complementizer \" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause ( e.g . in English , \" -ing \" or \" -ed \" can be viewed as a type of complementizer ) . Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause The positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of branching in linguistics . Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun ( so-called head-initial or VO languages ) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers following the head noun , as well as verbs preceding their objects . French , Spanish and Arabic are prototypical languages of this sort . Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun ( so-called head-final or OV languages ) generally also have adjectives and genitive modifiers preceding the head noun , as well as verbs following their objects . Turkish and Japanese are prototypical languages of this sort . Not all languages fit so easily into these categories . English , for example , is generally head-first , but has adjectives preceding their head nouns , and genitive constructions with both preceding and following modifiers ( \" the friend of my father \" vs . \" my father \\'s friend \" ) . Chinese has the VO order , with verb preceding object , but otherwise is generally head-final . Various possibilities for ordering are : Relative clause following the head noun , as in English , French or Arabic . Relative clause preceding the head noun , as in Turkish , Japanese , or Chinese . Head noun within the relative clause ( an internally headed relative clause ) . An example of such a language is Navajo . These languages are said to have nonreduced relative clauses . These languages have a structure equivalent to \" [ I saw the person yesterday ] went home \" . Adjoined relative clause . These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause , and use a correlative structure to link the two . These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses . Hindi is the most well known such language , and have a structure similar to \" Which person I saw yesterday , that person went home \" or ( with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause ) \" I saw which person yesterday , that person went home \" . Another example is Warlpiri , which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to \" I saw the man yesterday , which he was going home \" . However , it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all , since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as \" I saw the man who was going home yesterday \" or \" I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home \" . Accessibility hierarchy The antecedent of the relative clause ( that is , the noun that is modified by it ) can in theory be the subject of the main clause , or its object , or any other verb argument . In many languages , however , especially rigidly left-branching , dependent-marking languages with prenominal relative clauses , there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have in the relative clause . Edward Keenan and Bernard Comrie noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible : Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Oblique > Genitive > Object of comparative Ergative–absolutive languages have a similar hierarchy : Absolutive > Ergative > Indirect Object > etc . ( same as above ) This order is called the accessibility hierarchy . If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy , it can always relativize positions higher up , but not vice versa . For example , Malagasy can relativize only subject and Chukchi only absolutive arguments , whilst Basque can relativize absolutives , ergatives and indirect objects , but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives . Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances , e.g . for pronominal reflexes . English can relativize all positions in the hierarchy . Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English : Some other examples : Languages that can not relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative voices to \" raise \" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized . The most common example is the use of applicative voices to relativize obliques , but in such languages as Chukchi antipassives are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive . For example , a language that can relativize only subjects could say this : The girl [ who likes me ] came to visit . But not : The girl [ whom I like ] came to visit . The girl [ whom I gave a rose to ] came to visit . The girl [ whom I watched a movie with ] came to visit . The girl [ whose father I know ] came to visit . The girl [ whom I know the father of ] came to visit . ( equivalent to previous ) The girl [ whom I am taller than ] came to visit . These languages might form an equivalent sentence by passivization : The girl [ who was liked by me ] came to visit . The girl [ who was given a rose by me ] came to visit . The girl [ who was watched a movie with by me ] came to visit . The girl [ who was known the father of by me ] came to visit . The girl [ who was been taller than by me ] came to visit . These passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy ; the last two , in particular , are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers . But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position , and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages . A further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects . Hence the following would be possible : The girl [ who I like ] came to visit . The other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical . These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called applicative voice , much as the passive voice moves an oblique object to the subject position . The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following ( in not necessarily grammatical English ) : The girl [ who I gave a rose ] came to visit . The girl [ who I with-watched a movie ] came to visit . The girl [ who I ( of- ) know the father ] came to visit . The girl [ who I out-tall ] came to visit . Modern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions—e.g . in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the subcat list , and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts . The hierarchy also figures in Lexical Functional Grammar , where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy . Examples Indo-European languages English In English , a relative clause follows the noun it modifies . It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause , although sometimes simply by word order . If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause , it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause ( \" She is the woman whom I saw \" , not \" She is the woman I saw whom \" ) . The choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun , by whether the clause is restrictive or not , and by the role ( subject , direct object , or the like ) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause . For a human antecedent , \" who \" , \" whom \" , or \" that \" is usually used ( \" She is the person who saw me \" , \" He is the person whom I saw \" , \" He is the person that I saw \" ) . For a non-human antecedent , only \" that \" or \" which \" is used . For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause , only \" which \" is used ( \" The tree , which fell , is over there \" ) ; while either \" which \" or \" that \" may be used in a restrictive clause ( \" The tree which fell is over there \" , \" The tree that fell is over there \" ) but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of \" that \" in the restrictive context . Of the relative pronoun pair \" who \" and \" whom \" , the subjective case form ( \" who \" ) is used if it is the subject of the relative clause ( \" She is the police officer who saw me \" ) ; and , in formal usage , the objective case form ( \" whom \" ) if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause ( \" She is the police officer whom I saw \" , \" She is the police officer whom I talked to \" , \" She is the officer to whom I talked \" ) ; but in informal usage \" whom \" is often replaced by \" who \" . In English , as in some other languages ( such as French ; see below ) , non-restrictive relative clauses are set off with commas , but restrictive ones are not : \" I met a woman and a man yesterday . The woman , who had a thick French accent , was very tall . \" ( non-restrictive—does not narrow down who is being talked about ) \" I met two women yesterday , one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one . The woman who had the thick French accent was very tall . \" ( restrictive—adds information about who is being referred to ) The status of \" that \" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed . Traditional grammars treat \" that \" as a relative pronoun , but not all contemporary grammars do : e.g . the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language ( pp . 1056–7 ) makes a case for treating \" that \" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun ; and the British National Corpus treats \" that \" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses . One motivation for the different treatment of \" that \" is that there are differences between \" that \" and \" which \" ( e.g. , one can say \" in which \" but not \" in that \" , etc . ) . French The system of relative pronouns in French is as complicated as , but similar in many ways to , the system in English . When the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause , is generally used , although , which is inflected for grammatical gender and number , is sometimes used in order to give more precision . For example , any of the following is correct and would translate to \" I talked to his/her father and mother , whom I already knew \" : However , in the first sentence , \" whom I already knew \" refers only to the mother ; in the second , it refers to both parents ; and in the third , as in the English sentence , it could refer either only to the mother , or to both parents . When the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause , is generally used , though as before , may be used instead for greater precision . ( This is less common than the use of with direct objects , however , since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects . ) Contrary to English , the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French , not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause . Here is what I think Ø happened . ( literally : \" Here is what I think that happened . \" ) When the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense , where the preposition de ( of/from ) would normally be used , the pronoun ( \" whose \" ) is used , but does not act as a determiner for the noun \" possessed \" : ( \" I spoke with a woman whose son I work with . \" - lit. , \" I spoke with a woman of whom the son is my colleague . \" ) This construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by : ( \" That \\'s the man of whom I spoke . \" ) More generally , in modern French , can signal the topic of the following clause , without replacing anything in this clause : ( \" That \\'s a man about whom I believe that he must make a lot of money . \" ) When the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition ( other than when is used ) , is generally used , though can be used if the antecedent is human . ( \" These are people that can be depended on . \" ) [ literally : \" on whom one can depend \" ] ( \" This is a table on which you can put a lot of things \" ) * C\\'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses . There exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun . In that case , can not be used because it must agree in gender with its head , and an indefinite pronoun has no gender . Instead , , which usually means \" what \" , is used . ( \" This is obviously something that he has thought a lot about . \" ) * C\\'est manifestement quelque chose à laquelle il a beaucoup réfléchi . The same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause , also lacking gender . ( \" He told me to get lost , to which I replied that ... \" ) The preposition always appears before the pronoun , and the prepositions and ( at/to ) contract with to form and , or with to form and . German Aside from their highly inflected forms , German relative pronouns are less complicated than English . There are two varieties . The more common one is based on the definite article der , die , das , but with distinctive forms in the genitive ( dessen , deren ) and in the dative plural ( denen ) . Historically this is related to English that . The second , which is more literary and used for emphasis , is the relative use of welcher , welche , welches , comparable with English which . As in most Germanic languages , including Old English , both of these varieties inflect according to gender , case and number . They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify , but the case from their function in their own clause . Das Haus , in dem ich wohne , ist sehr alt . The house in which I live is very old . The relative pronoun dem is neuter singular to agree with Haus , but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause . On the same basis , it would be possible to substitute the pronoun welchem . However , German uses the uninflecting was ( \\'what \\' ) as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is alles , etwas or nichts ( \\'everything \\' , \\'something \\' , \\'nothing \\' ) . Alles , was Jack macht , gelingt ihm . Everything that Jack does is a success . In German , all relative clauses are marked with commas . Alternatively , particularly in formal registers , participles ( both active and passive ) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases : Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after Die Regierung möchte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter fördern The government would like to further promote this industry , which has grown rather slowly over the last year Unlike English , which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions ( typically just the participle and adverbs ) , and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles , German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity . Spanish Latin In Latin , relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify , and are always introduced using relative pronouns . Relative pronouns , like other pronouns in Latin , agree with their antecedents in gender and number , but not in case : a relative pronoun \\'s case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces , while its antecedent \\'s case reflects the antecedent \\'s role in the clause that contains the relative clause . ( Nonetheless , it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case . ) For example : Urbēs , quae sunt magnae , videntur . ( The cities , which are large , are being seen . ) Urbēs , quās vīdī , erant magnae . ( The cities , which I saw , were large . ) In the former example , urbēs and quae both function as subjects in their respective clauses , so both are in the nominative case ; and due to gender and number agreement , both are feminine and plural . In the latter example , both are still feminine and plural , and urbēs is still in the nominative case , but quae has been replaced by quās , its accusative-case counterpart , to reflect its role as the direct object of vīdī . For more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns , see the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension . Ancient Greek Ancient Greek follows ( almost ) the same rules as Latin . However , there is a phenomenon in Ancient Greek called case attraction , where the case of the relative pronoun can be \" attracted \" to the case of its antecedent . In this example , although the relative pronoun should be in the accusative case , as the object of \" obtain \" , it is attracted to the genitive case of its antecedent ( \" of the freedom ... \" ) . The Ancient Greek relative pronoun ὅς , ἥ , ὅ ( hós , hḗ , hó ) is unrelated to the Latin word , since it derives from Proto-Indo-European : in Proto-Greek , y before a vowel usually changed to h ( debuccalization ) . Cognates include Sanskrit relative pronouns yas , yā , yad ( where o changed to short a ) . The Greek definite article ὁ , ἡ , τό ( ho , hē , tó ) has a different origin , since it is related to the Sanskrit demonstrative sa , sā and Latin is-tud . Information that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek . This was made particularly expressive by the rich suite of participles available , with active and passive participles in present , past and future tenses . This is called the attributive participle . Serbo-Croatian Serbo-Croatian uses exactly the same principle as Latin does . The following sentences are the Latin examples translated to Serbo-Croatian ( the same sentences apply to the Croatian , Serbian , Bosnian , and Montenegrin standard variants of the pluricentric language ) : In the first sentence , koji is in the nominative , and in the second koje is in the accusative . Both words are two case forms of the same relative pronoun , that is inflicted for gender ( here : masculine ) , number ( here : plural ) , and case . An alternative relativizing strategy is the use of the non-declinable word što \\'that \\' to introduce a relative clause . This word is used together with a resumptive pronoun , i.e . a personal pronoun that agrees in gender and number with the antecedent , while its case form depends on its function in the relative clause . The resumptive pronoun never appears in subject function . Relative clauses are relatively frequent in modern Serbo-Croatian since they have expanded as attributes at the expense of the participles performing that function . The most frequently used relative pronoun is koji . There are several ongoing changes concerning koji . One of them is the spread of the genitive-accusative syncretism to the masculine inanimate of the pronoun . The cause lies in the necessity to disambiguate the subject and the object by morphological means . The nominative-accusative syncretism of the form koji is inadequate , so the genitive form kojeg is preferred : Celtic languages The Celtic languages ( at least the modern Insular Celtic languages ) distinguish two types of relative clause : direct relative clauses and indirect relative clauses . A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause ( e.g . \" the man who saw me \" , \" the man whom I saw \" ) , while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival ( e.g . \" the man whose daughter is in the hospital \" ) or is the object of a preposition ( e.g . \" the man to whom I gave the book \" ) . Direct relative clauses are formed with a relative pronoun ( unmarked for case ) at the beginning ; a gap ( in terms of syntactic theory , a trace , indicated by ( t ) in the examples below ) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun \\'s expected position . Irish Welsh The direct relative particle \" a \" is not used with \" mae \" ( \" is \" ) in Welsh ; instead the form \" sydd \" or \" sy \\' \" is used : There is also a defective verb \" piau \" ( usually lenited to \" biau \" ) , corresponding to \" who own ( s ) \" : Indirect relative clauses are formed with a relativizer at the beginning ; the relativized element remains in situ in the relative clause . Irish Welsh Although both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are \\' a \\' , the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant , while the relativizer triggers eclipsis ( see Irish initial mutations ) . Both direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis , often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement . For instance , the Welsh example above , \" y dyn a welais \" means not only \" the man whom I saw \" , but also \" it was the man ( and not anyone else ) I saw \" ; and \" y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo \" can likewise mean \" it was the man ( and not anyone else ) to whom I gave the book \" . Semitic languages Hebrew In Biblical Hebrew , relative clauses were headed with the word asher , which could be either a relative pronoun or a relativizer . In later times , asher became interchangeable with the prefix she- ( which is also used as a conjunction , with the sense of English that ) , and in Modern Hebrew , this use of she- is much more common than asher , except in some formal , archaic , or poetic writing . In meaning , the two are interchangeable ; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human , regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause , and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive . Further , because Hebrew does not generally use its word for is , she- is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution : Ha-kise l\\'-yad-ekh . ( \" The chair is next to you . \" - lit. , \" The-chair [ is ] next-to-you . \" ) Ha-kise she-l\\'-yad-ekh shavur . ( \" The chair next to you is broken . \" —lit. , \" The-chair that- [ is ] -next-to-you [ is ] broken . \" ) ( This use of she- does not occur with simple adjectives , as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction . For example , Ha-kise adom means \" The chair [ is ] red , \" while Ha-kis \\' e ha-adom shavur means \" The red chair is broken \" —literally , \" The chair the red [ is ] broken . \" ) Since 1994 , the official rules of Modern Hebrew ( as determined by the Academy of the Hebrew Language ) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English ( described above ) . That is , non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas , while restrictive clauses are not : Ha-kise , she-at yoshevet alav , shavur . ( \" The chair , which you are sitting on , is broken . \" ) Ha-kise she-at yoshevet alav shavur . ( \" The chair that you are sitting on is broken . \" ) Nonetheless , many speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules , which were based on the German rules ( described above ) . Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above , these speakers set off all relative clauses , restrictive or not , with commas : Ha-kise , she-at yoshevet alav , shavur . ( \" The chair that you are sitting on is broken , \" or \" The chair , which you are sitting on , is broken . \" ) One major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in ( for example ) English is that in Hebrew , what might be called the \" regular \" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause . To reuse the prior example : Ha-kise , she-at yoshevet alav , shavur . ( lit. , \" The chair , which you are sitting on it , [ is ] broken . \" ) More specifically , if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause , it is always suppressed . If it is the direct object , then it is usually suppressed , though it is also correct to leave it in . ( If it is suppressed , then the special preposition et , used to mark the direct object , is suppressed as well . ) If it is the object of a preposition , it must be left in , because in Hebrew—unlike in English—a preposition can not appear without its object . When the pronoun is left in , she- might more properly be called a relativizer than a relative pronoun . The Hebrew relativizer she- \\'that \\' \" might be a shortened form of the Hebrew relativizer ‘ asher \\'that \\' , which is related to Akkadian ‘ ashru \\'place \\' ( cf . Semitic * ‘ athar ) . Alternatively , Hebrew ‘ asher derived from she- , or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic dhu ( cf . Aramaic dī ) and ‘ asher [ ... ] Whereas Israeli she- functions both as complementizer and relativizer , ashér can only function as a relativize . \" Arabic Literary Arabic In Modern Standard and Classical Arabic there is a relative pronoun ( in Arabic : ) allaḏī ( masculine singular ) , feminine singular allatī , masculine plural allaḏīna , feminine plural allawātī , masculine dual allaḏānī ( nominative ) / allaḏayni ( accusative and genitive ) , feminine dual allatānī ( nom . ) / allataynī ( acc . and gen. ) . Its usage has two specific rules : it agrees with the antecedent in gender , number and case , and it is used only if the antecedent is definite . If the antecedent is indefinite , no relative pronoun is used . The former is called jumlat sila ( conjunctive sentence ) while the latter is called jumlat sifa ( descriptive sentence ) . Colloquial Arabic In Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form , a simple conjunction , which in most dialects is illi , and is never omitted . So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be : alwalad illi shuftō fi ( a ) ssaff embārih ghāyeb alyōm hāda walad illi shuftō fi ( a ) ssaff embārihAs in Hebrew , the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally , \" the boy whom I saw him in class ... \" ( the -hu in ra\\'aituhu and the -ō in shuftō ) . The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew : obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause , obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition , and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object . The only difference from Hebrew is that , in the case of the direct object , it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it . Japonic languages Japanese Japanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents . Instead , the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an attributive verb , occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective ( before the noun phrase ) . In fact , since so-called i-adjectives in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs , it can be argued that the structure of the first example ( with an adjective ) is the same as the others . A number of \" adjectival \" meanings , in Japanese , are customarily shown with relative clauses consisting solely of a verb or a verb complex : Often confusing to speakers of languages which use relative pronouns are relative clauses which would in their own languages require a preposition with the pronoun to indicate the semantic relationship among the constituent parts of the phrase . Here , the preposition \" in \" is missing from the Japanese ( \" missing \" in the sense that the corresponding postposition would be used with the main clause verb in Japanese ) Common sense indicates what the meaning is in this case , but the \" missing preposition \" can sometimes create ambiguity . In this case , ( 1 ) is the context-free interpretation of choice , but ( 2 ) is possible with the proper context . Without more context , both ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) are equally viable interpretations of the Japanese . Caucasian languages Georgian In Georgian , there are two strategies for forming relative clauses . The first is similar to that of English or Latin : the modified noun is followed by a relativizer that inflects for its embedded case and may take a postposition . The relativized noun may be preceded by a determiner . A second , more colloquial , strategy is marked by the invariant particle რომ rom . This particle is generally the second word of the clause , and since it does not decline , is often followed by the appropriately cased third-person pronoun to show the relativized noun \\'s role in the embedded clause . A determiner precedes the relativized noun , which is also usually preceded by the clause as a whole . Such relative clauses may be internally headed . In such cases , the modified noun moves into the clause , taking the appropriate declension for its role therein ( thus eliminating the need for the third person pronouns in the above examples ) , and leaves behind the determiner ( which now functions as a pronoun ) in the matrix clause . Austronesian languages Indonesian Indonesian , a zero-copula language that does not mark verb tense , allows a variety of types of relative clause , normally restrictive . They are usually introduced by the relative pronoun yang , which stands for \" who \" / \" which \" / \" what \" / \" that \" .Yang is not allowed as the object of a relative clause , so that Indonesian can not exactly reproduce structures such as \" the house that Jack built \" . Instead , a passive form of construction must be used : Relative clauses with no antecedent to yang are possible : Tagalog Tagalog uses the gapping strategy to form relative clauses , with the complementizer , na / =ng \\'that \\' , separating the head , which is the noun being modified , from the actual relative clause . In ( 1a ) below , lalaki \\'man \\' serves as the head , while nagbigay ng bigas sa bata \\'gave rice to the child \\' is the relative clause . The gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken , had it been in a declarative sentence . In ( 1a ) , the gap is in subject position within the relative clause . This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ang lalaki \\'the man \\' in the declarative sentence in ( 1b ) . There is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativized and in which a gap can appear : A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativized . The phrases in ( 2 ) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativized are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses . In ( 2a ) , the gap is in direct object position , while in ( 2b ) , the gap is in indirect object position . The correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in ( 2 ) are found in ( 3 ) , where the verbs have been passivized in order to raise the logical direct object in ( 3a ) and the logical indirect object in ( 3b ) to subject position . ( Tagalog can have more than one passive voice form for any given verb . ) Tagalog relative clauses can be left-headed , as in ( 1a ) and ( 3 ) , right-headed , as in ( 4 ) , or internally headed , as in ( 5 ) . In ( 4 ) , the head , lalaki \\'man \\' , is found after or to the right of the relative clause , nagbigay ng bigas sa bata \\'gave rice to the child \\' . In ( 5 ) , the head is found in some position inside the relative clause . When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause , the complementizer appears to the left of the head . When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause , the complementizer surfaces to the right of the head . There are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativization mentioned above . The first involves relativizing the possessor of a noun phrase within the relative clause . In ( 6 ) , the head , bata \\'child \\' , is the owner of the injured finger . The phrase ang daliri \\'the finger \\' is the subject of the verb , nasugatan \\'was injured \\' . Another exception involves relativizing the oblique noun phrase . When an oblique noun phrase is relativized , as in ( 7a ) , na \\'that \\' , the complementizer that separates the head from the relative clause , is optional . The relative clause itself is also composed differently . In the examples in ( 1a ) , and in ( 3 ) to ( 6 ) , the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap . However , the relative clause in ( 7a ) looks more like an indirect question , complete with the interrogative complementizer , kung \\'if \\' , and a pre-verbally positioned WH-word like saan \\'where \\' , as in ( 7b ) . The sentence in ( 7c ) is the declarative version of the relative clause in ( 7a ) , illustrating where the head , ospital \\'hospital \\' , would have been \" before \" relativization . The question in ( 7d ) shows the direct question version of the subordinate indirect question in ( 7b ) . Hawaiian Relative clauses in Hawaiian are avoided unless they are short . If in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective , in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective : \" The honest man \" instead of \" the man who is honest \" . If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun , in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead : \" Paul , an apostle \" instead of \" Paul , who was an apostle \" . If the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb , in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause : \" the people fallen \" instead of \" the people who fell \" ; \" the thing given \" instead of \" the thing that was given \" . But when the relative clause \\'s antecedent is a person , the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause , and the relative clause \\'s verb is active and transitive , a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun nana : The one who me ( past ) sent = \" the one who sent me \" . If in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause , in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed : the things of me to have seen = \" the things that I saw \" ; Here is theirs to have seen = This is what they saw \" . Andean languages Aymara Chinese Mandarin In Mandarin Chinese , the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies , and ends with the relative particle de ( 的 ) . If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object ( in other words , if the verb is transitive ) , the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause : If the object but not the subject is missing from the relative clause , the main-clause noun is the implied object of the relative clause : If both the subject and the object are missing from the relative clause , then the main-clause noun could either be the implied subject or the implied object of the relative clause ; sometimes which is intended is clear from the context , especially when the subject or object of the verb must be human and the other must be non-human : But sometimes ambiguity arises when it is not clear from the context whether the main-clause noun is intended as the subject or the object of the relative clause : However , the first meaning ( in which the main-clause noun is the subject ) is usually intended , as the second can be unambiguously stated using a passive voice marker : Sometimes a relative clause has both a subject and an object specified , in which case the main-clause noun is the implied object of an implied preposition in the relative clause : It is also possible to include the preposition explicitly in the relative clause , but in that case it takes a pronoun object ( a personal pronoun with the function of a relative pronoun ) : Free relative clauses are formed in the same way , omitting the modified noun after the particle de . As with bound relative clauses , ambiguity may arise ; for example , \" eat ( particle ) \" may mean \" that which is eaten \" , i.e . \" food \" , or \" those who eat \" . Creoles Hawaiian Creole English In Hawaiian Creole English , an English-based creole also called Hawaiian Pidgin or simply Pidgin , relative clauses work in a way that is similar to , but not identical to , the way they work in English . As in English , a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted : For example , can also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted , as However , relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English ; they can be included , as is mandatory in English , they can be omitted , or they can be replaced by another pronoun . For example , all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing : Gullah In Gullah , an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States , no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause .

The next day , Bonnie performs in a singing contest . While Bonnie does not win , she manages to attract the attention of a mysterious man . He says nothing to her and only nods and leaves . That night as the children walk home , they spot the old house which has been renovated . The townspeople also spot the house and think it is unusual for a house to be renovated so fast . The same moment , the town banker sells the mortgage on one of his houses and the Nelson family are evicted . Bonnie \\'s mother immediately leaves to locate the person who bought their house . She knocks on the door only to find the same man who was watching Bonnie \\'s contest : Hans the Butler . He is tense , but welcomes Mrs . Nelson inside and shows her to The Master of the home ( Mr . Ribaldi ) , when she is sternly instructed to stop at the rug . The man remains seated in the darkness . He answers to Mrs . Nelson \\'s demands by returning their home directly to them in exchange for an agreement in which Bonnie would \" work \" for him . Mrs . Nelson asks why she ca n\\'t do the job instead of her daughter . He evades the question which alarms Mrs . Nelson . She refuses , which enrages Ribaldi and he has her thrown out of the mansion , but not before she catches a glimpse of Ribaldi \\'s scarred face . Later , she tells Bonnie the bad news but Bonnie asks her permission to accept the job . Mrs . Nelson reluctantly agrees and sends Bonnie to the mansion . For the moment , her only chores are to assist Hans . He informs Bonnie that she is free to go into any room in the house , except for the master suite , though he has to resort to bribery to keep from explaining why . However , she walks into the forbidden area once she hears a woman taking singing lessons from Mr . Ribaldi . He angrily grabs Bonnie but the woman ( Gabriella ) sends him away \" to pout \" . Meanwhile , many in the town are risking foreclosure as a result of the Depression and suspect the mysterious Ribaldi , who initially did the very same thing to The Nelsons . The people in town also begin receiving unknown sources of financial assistance . Some receive checks to pay for expensive medical procedures to heal crippling illnesses and others find employment . The townspeople suspect nothing of any of this . The children become curious and decide to prowl the mansion late at night . Their pranks are halted when the \" bloodsucker \" abducts a young girl who had walked with a limp . A riot occurs over the missing child , who reappears unharmed ( and with no limp . ) Trouble still plagues the citizens who place the blame on Ribaldi and his apparently antisocial behavior . They manage to disqualify Bonnie from the competition unless she stops visiting him . She refuses but Ribaldi insists she goes and casts her out of the mansion . However , both Ribaldi and Hans are astonished at her choice . Hans takes Bonnie to the competition at the state capital and prepares to sing a song written by Ribaldi . Georgie walks into the mansion and finds Ribaldi by himself . She asks for singing lessons , but Ribaldi says it is not a good day . He offers to take her part of the way home but Georgie insists on taking a dangerous shortcut near a hydroelectric dam . She slips by a torrent and falls in the water . The film returns to the competition , and it is now Bonnie \\'s turn to sing . Later , Mr . Ribaldi has an unconscious Georgie in his arms as he limps into town to find help . The townspeople think he caused her injury and so attack him . The town banker manages to stop the attack , but not before Ribaldi is badly battered .

She receives a standing ovation and first place . In the next scene , the angry mob breaks into the completely empty house , trashing it , only leaving once they find the bank book , to their delight . Upon reading it , however , they are shocked , disappointed , and saddened . The only transactions they find show that he has paid their medical bills . The banker then admits to increasing their house payments , and the mob leaves in disgust . The banker and his son take Mr . Ribaldi to the hospital . Bonnie and Hans return only to find that Mr . Ribaldi died a few hours before . They hold a funeral . Afterward , Hans says that he is returning home to a \" former employer \" . After Hans departs , some of the people walk past the mansion .

It was written by Neil Gaiman ; illustrated by Michael Allred , Gary Amaro , Mark Buckingham , Dick Giordano , Tony Harris , Steve Leialoha , Vince Locke , Shea Anton Pensa , Alec Stevens , Bryan Talbot , John Watkiss , and Michael Zulli ; colored by Danny Vozzo ; and lettered by Todd Klein . The stories in the collection first appeared in 1993 . The collection first appeared in paperback and hardback editions in 1994 with an introduction by Stephen King . The collection \\'s title , setting , and a number of its themes and images are also found in G.K . Chesterton \\'s poem \" A Child of the Snows \" . It was preceded by Brief Lives and followed by The Kindly Ones . Synopsis Like volumes 3 and 6 , Dream Country and Fables and Reflections , Worlds \\' End is a volume of predominantly single-issue short stories , often only obliquely related to the principal story of the series . The issues in Worlds \\' End were written and published in sequence , using a frame narrative . The story begins in the first person narration of Brant Tucker , wherein he and co-worker Charlene Mooney are involved in a car crash on their way to Chicago . Charlene is hurt , and Brant is directed by a hedgehog to a strange inn named \" Worlds \\' End , a free house \" : identified later as one of four inns where travelers between realms shelter during reality storms , which occur after momentous events . In conclusion , the revelers at the inn watch a funeral procession cross the sky , which ends with Death looking sadly into the inn , as the crescent moon behind her slowly turns red . Thereafter Brant returns alone to his own world , where he narrates his story to a waitress , while Charlene remains at the \\'Worlds \\' End \\' as assistant to its landlady . The framing sequence is penciled by Bryan Talbot and inked by Mark Buckingham , Dick Giordano and Steve Leialoha , with the exception of the funeral procession , which is penciled by Gary Amaro and inked by Tony Harris . The stories within the collection are each narrated by a different person during a storytelling session at the inn ; as the introduction notes , this is similar to the device used in Chaucer \\'s Canterbury Tales . This gives each a distinct style both in the telling and in the illustration , with the collection drawn together by the short sequences between stories set at the inn itself . Each story told contains at least one character telling a story . Contents ( # 51 ) \" A Tale of Two Cities \" The first story eschews the traditional comic style , with linked panels containing speech bubbles and panels which narrate the story : instead , the narration appears as prose , with illustrations interrupting at intervals . Gaiman had asked artist Alec Stevens to model the approach after that which he had employed in The Sinners , published by DC \\'s Piranha Press imprint in June 1989 . This approach is a unique , stained-glass-like style that takes a nod to the German Expressionists of the early 20th century . \" A Tale \" concerns a city dweller who finds himself one day in what he believes to be the dream of the city in which he lives , wherein an old man explains his fear that the cities will someday awaken . He also encounters Morpheus , and a woman who looks like Death , but who Gaiman has said is not . When asked , Stevens said that he drew his own \\'Mona \\' character from his Hardcore graphic novel , published by Piranha Press in January 1990 . It ends with the frightened city dweller returning to \" reality \" , whereupon he moves away from the city to a small village , where the storyteller meets him . He fears that one day , the cities will awaken . This story is influenced by the work of horror writer H.P . Lovecraft , especially in its image of a character nearly driven to madness after discovering a truth that humans were never meant to know . In his introduction to Lovecraft , The Dream Cycle of H . P . Lovecraft : Dreams of Terror and Death , Gaiman writes , \" There \\'s something about Lovecraft \\'s fiction , about his worlds , that is oddly alluring for a writer of fantasy and horror . I \\'ve written three Lovecraftian stories : one obliquely , in Sandman—a quiet , dreamlike story ( it \\'s the first story in the Worlds \\' End collection . You can tell it \\'s Lovecraftian , because I use the word \" cyclopean \" in it ) . \" ( # 52 ) \" Cluracan \\'s Tale \" The second story is a fantasy adventure , narrated by the flamboyant representative of Faerie introduced in Season of Mists , Cluracan , in which he is sent to the city Aurelian ( resembling imperial Rome ) to represent the interests of Faerie in the political struggle there , and causes uproar with a prophecy to the ruler of Aurelian . He is imprisoned immediately , but freed by Morpheus , who is alerted to his plight by Cluracan \\'s sister , Nuala , in Morpheus \\' service . Using his faerie powers to disguise himself , Cluracan provokes the inhabitants of Aurelian to rebellion against their ruler , who is thereupon killed by his undead predecessor . John Watkiss draws this story . ( # 53 ) \" Hob \\'s Leviathan \" The third story , set in the early 20th century , is told by a girl who poses as a boy , Jim , to go to sea , and therefore may be inspired by the traditional folk song \" The Handsome Cabin Boy \" . It concerns the difficulties presented by extraordinary truths , and reintroduces Hob Gadling , who appears in The Doll \\'s House . Jim makes a voyage from Singapore to Liverpool , stopping in India , where Hob is presented as a guest on the ship , and persuades the captain to transport an Indian stowaway . The Indian tells a tale in which a king gives his wife a fruit conferring immortality ; whereupon she gives it to her secret paramour , who gives it to a courtesan , who returns it to the king ; whereafter the king abdicates , eats the fruit himself , and goes wandering . It is later implied that the stowaway is the king in disguise ; this is confirmed in The Wake . Before the end of their journey , a massive leviathan appears and surrounds the ship in a terrible display , then disappears . Jim is eager to converse on the subject ; but all the sailors refuse , and Hob himself dissuades Jim . The story ends with Hob revealing Jim \\'s true identity and Jim learning that Hob owns the ship on which they travel . The story is penciled by Michael Zulli and inked by Dick Giordano . ( # 54 ) \" The Golden Boy \" The fourth story is told to Brant alone by an Asian traveller , and depicts an alternate history in which U.S . President Richard Nixon is succeeded by Prez Rickard , who as President averts a war in the Middle East , solves the energy crisis and enforces social justice . Throughout the story he is haunted by \" Boss Smiley \" , an immortal political boss presiding over Prez \\'s world . In Prez \\'s second term , a deranged woman wounds Prez and kills his new fiancée to gain the celebrity Ted Grant \\'s attention ( similar to John Hinckley , Jr. ) . Prez finishes his term , retires to his hometown and eventually fades from public knowledge . After his death , Boss Smiley offers him an unsatisfying afterlife and Dream instead permits Prez to explore other alternate histories of America . Prez is herein made a Messiah figure for the American dream : young , idealistic , brilliant and transitory . His likenesses to Jesus Christ are demonstrated through parallels with stories from the Gospels , including events similar to Jesus \\'s discussions with the temple elders or the temptation of Christ ; and stories from other religious traditions such as Taoism are included . ( # 55 ) \" Cerements \" The fifth story is told by a \\'prentice \\' ( Petrefax ) from the necropolis Litharge , a city devoted to the practice of various methods of burial , derived from multiple cultures . Petrefax tells of his apprenticeship , and relates the stories told by other masters and apprentices at an exposure he attends . The first story is that of Billy Scutt , a master hangman who tricks his own jailors into permitting him a natural death , told by Mig . Scroyle \\'s tale , the second , features Destruction , who tells of an earlier necropolis , destroyed by Destiny for failing to honor the funerary traditions necessary to the first Despair \\'s interment ; this story , and the one that follows it , prove important to events in the tenth collection , The Wake . Master Hermas \\' tale comes third , telling of Mistress Veltiss who in relates four of her town tales : one of a mortician and a giant , another of a gravedigger , the third of a layover in a tavern at worlds \\' end , and her own tale , which also obliquely involves the Endless .

They are now available on DVD . The series began in 1991 with Summoned by Shadows , co-produced with the BBC Film Club as a knowing homage to the long-running British science fiction television series Doctor Who ( of which BBV founder Bill Baggs was a fan ) and in a pragmatic attempt to take advantage of the consequent pre-existing audience . Summoned by Shadows is a Who-style tale of strange doings in an unspecified time period on Earth featuring three actors known for their roles in Doctor Who and playing similar characters . The unnamed protagonist ( listed in the credits as \" The Stranger \" ) is played by Colin Baker , his assistant Miss Brown by Nicola Bryant , who had played the Doctor \\'s assistant Peri Brown opposite Colin Baker for two years , and the villain of the piece by Michael Wisher , who had been the first actor to play Davros . The second story , More than a Messiah , adapted the Doctor Who Audio Visuals story of the same name , but with the Stranger and Miss Brown substituted for the Doctor and companion Ria ( who was modelled after Peri ) . In a further connection , it co-starred Sophie Aldred , better known as Ace from Doctor Who , and Peter Miles , who had co-starred ( opposite Wisher ) in the TV serial Genesis of the Daleks – both in completely different roles.In Memory Alone , the third film , found the Stranger and Miss Brown stranded without their mysterious transport ( never seen ) in a desolate train station with amnesia , and battling a robot and a mysterious man played by Nicholas Briggs ( who also wrote the film along with others in the Stranger series ) . Most releases of this film ( including VHS ) include a behind-the-scenes featurette and a blooper reel . While the first three may be ( and often were ) taken as Doctor Who by another name , the departure of the Miss Brown character ( for which Nicola Bryant does not speak with Peri Brown \\'s American accent ) and the Stranger himself being likewise \" returned to his proper time and place \" at the story \\'s conclusion allowed for a move to clarify The Strangers status as separate work of fiction and developed an identity of its own . The adventures of the Stranger ran in all to six videos ( and four audio dramas , although the second audio drama was much the same as the sixth video ) . History of the Stranger In a pan-dimensional area referred to as the \" Dimensional Web \" , there exist two races : the Protectorate , which are currently dominant and in charge , and the Preceptors , apparently defeated by the Protectorate . The Preceptors act by taking on corporeal forms within the material universe and carry out random acts of violence , terrorism and assassination in an effort to strike back at their oppressors ( although it is never truly determined which race is in the right and which is in the wrong ) , usually in teams of two or three . One such Preceptor cell is headed by Solomon , considered one of the top Preceptor leaders . His second-in-command and partner is Egan ( played by David Troughton ) and the third member of the team is a relative newcomer named Saul ( John Wadmore ) . Solomon and Egan have worked together for a long time and therefore have complete faith in one another . However , one mission , while accomplishing the objective ( the assassination of an unimportant female caterer ) , ends in disaster with Solomon being captured by the Protectorate and Egan and Saul managing to escape . Since the Protectorate no longer believe in execution ( their own past is too bloody for that ) and incarceration would be a drain on their resources , Solomon is selected to be the first to undergo a new process – the Estrangement Programme , in which the prejudices of the subject are \" extracted \" by a form of mental block or conditioning and wiping out all past memories of the subject \\'s \" crimes \" ( the Protectorate state emphatically that this is not brainwashing ) .Note : \" \\' In the audio adventure \" The Last Mission \" , it is revealed that during the above mission Solomon was captured by the planet \\'s local security force , but the officer in charge ( Elisabeth Sladen ) turned out to be a Protectorate agent who had set a trap for all three Preceptors . While Solomon was in her custody , she offered Solomon a deal in which , in return for her allowing the Preceptors to accomplish their mission and Egan and Saul \\'s escape , Solomon would surrender himself to the Protectorate and undergo the then-experimental Estrangement Programme . Believing that his beliefs were not prejudices and that the program would not affect him , he agreed , never revealing the bargain to Egan and Saul . After Solomon undergoes the procedure , he is assigned a Protectorate observer who also acts as a companion , Miss Brown ( Nicola Bryant ) , and begins his new life as the Doctor-like \" Stranger \" . However , in the adventure In Memory Alone , the Stranger , while suffering from amnesia and in order to defeat a malfunctioning combat suit , is forced to hook up his own brain to a computer system , and the resulting shock causes the mental conditioning to be disrupted . The Stranger arrives in England on Earth in The Terror Game still suffering from amnesia , but runs into Egan and Saul ( who now believe that the Stranger , now identified as \" Solomon \" , may have turned traitor ) and Tamora Hennessay ( Louise Jameson ) . After Tamora reveals herself to be another Protectorate agent , Solomon escapes and goes into hiding under the name of \" Preston Richards \" while slowly recovering his lost memories and trying to learn whether or not he \\'s still being affected by the Estrangement Programme . In the adventure Breach of the Peace , Egan and Saul , using the identities of Metropolitan Police detectives , track Solomon down and force him to take them back into the Web , but Metaphysic , a heavily guarded research project where an experiment in psychokinesis is being conducted by a Dr Hunter ( Geoffrey Beevers ) on a talented girl named Meta ( Bernadette Gepheart ) , causes a tear in the Web that drags Solomon , Egan and Saul back to England ( Eye of the Beholder ) and forces them to intervene when Hunter \\'s experiment goes out of control . Video series Another BBV production , The Airzone Solution , is sometimes erroneously listed as part of the Stranger series . In fact , it is a standalone \" ecological thriller \" film that , other than its cast , has no connection to either the Stranger or Doctor Who . Audio series Eye of the Storm is the basis for the video Eye of the Beholder , and while having the same basic plotline trims down the number of parts/actors , changes certain events and has a different ending with Meta deliberately sacrificing herself to save Solomon , Egan and Saul ( whereas in the video Solomon is forced to kill Meta at her own request to save himself and Egan ) .

S . Lewis , the final book in Lewis \\'s theological science fiction Space Trilogy . The events of this novel follow those of Out of the Silent Planet and Perelandra ( also titled Voyage to Venus ) and once again feature the philologist Elwin Ransom . Yet unlike the principal events of those two novels , the story takes place on Earth rather than elsewhere in the Solar System . The story involves an ostensibly scientific institute , the N.I.C.E. , which is a front for sinister supernatural forces . The novel was heavily influenced by the writing of Lewis \\'s friend and fellow Inkling Charles Williams , and is markedly dystopian in style . In the foreword , Lewis states that the novel \\'s point is the same as that of his 1943 non-fiction work The Abolition of Man , which argues that there are natural laws and objective values that education should teach children to recognise . The novel \\'s title is taken from a poem written by David Lyndsay in 1555 , , also known as The Monarche . The couplet in question , \" \" , refers to the Tower of Babel . Plot summary The novel , written during the final period of World War II , takes place at an undetermined year \" after the end of the war \" . Mark Studdock is a young academic who has just become a Senior Fellow in sociology at Bracton College in the University of Edgestow . The fellows of Bracton are debating the sale of a portion of college land to the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments ( N.I.C.E . ) , whose staff already includes some college faculty . The sale is controversial since the land in question ( Bragdon Wood ) is an ancient woodland believed to be the resting place of Merlin . After the deal is struck , a N.I.C.E . insider called Lord Feverstone proposes a possible post for Mark at the Institute . ( It is gradually revealed that Feverstone is the new title of Richard Devine , who accompanied Professor Weston on the trip to Mars in Out of the Silent Planet , but not on the trip to Venus in Perelandra . ) Mark \\'s wife Jane ( a PhD student at the university ) has suffered a peculiar nightmare involving a severed head . She meets Mrs . Dimble , the wife of one of her former tutors , who is being evicted due to sale of land to the N.I.C.E . When Jane talks about her dreams , Mrs . Dimble leads her to seek counsel from a Miss Ironwood who lives in the Manor in the nearby town of St Anne \\'s . An argument between Jane and Mark shows how their marriage is deteriorating . Lord Feverstone introduces Mark to the N.I.C.E. , where he becomes acquainted with the top brass at their headquarters at Belbury , near Edgestow . Mark can never find out what his place in the organisation is ; he has no office , is given no duties for some time , and seems to be alternately in and out of favour . A scientist named Bill Hingest , who is resigning from the N.I.C.E. , warns Mark to get out . That night , Hingest is mysteriously murdered . At the same time , Jane works up the courage to visit Miss Ironwood at St Anne \\'s . Miss Ironwood , who is dressed in black just as Jane had dreamed of her , is convinced that Jane \\'s dreams are visions of genuine events . Later , Jane is introduced to Dr Elwin Ransom , the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis \\'s space trilogy . He has become the Pendragon or heir of King Arthur , the ruler of the nation of Logres , which is described as the good side of Britain . More mundanely , he is the Director of the group living in the Manor at St Anne \\'s . He is in communication with the Oyéresu ( singular \" Oyarsa \" ) , angelic beings who guide the planets of the Solar System . Earth has been in quarantine : its rebellious Oyarsa ( who is the Devil ) and his demons could not travel beyond the orbit of the Moon , and the other Oyéresu could not come to Earth . Mark is finally given work : to write pseudonymous newspaper articles supporting the N.I.C.E. , including two for use after a riot they intend to provoke in Edgestow . The riot takes place as planned , allowing the N.I.C.E . \\'s private police force to take over the town . They arrest Jane , whom the N.I.C.E . are interested in ( as revealed later ) for her psychic abilities , which they fear will get into their opponents \\' hands . The head of the N.I.C.E . police , a woman known as \" Fairy \" Hardcastle , starts to torture Jane but is forced to release her when rioters turn in her direction . Mark is once again out of favour in the N.I.C.E. , but after a conversation with an Italian scientist named Filostrato he is introduced to the Head of the Institute . This turns out to be a literal head – that of a recently guillotined French scientist ( as Jane dreamed ) which Filostrato erroneously believes he has restored to life by his own efforts . From Jane \\'s dreams that people were digging up the grave of a long-buried man and that the man had left , Ransom concludes that the N.I.C.E . is looking for the body of Merlin , who truly is buried in Bragdon Wood , though not dead but in a timeless state . Jane will guide members of the group to the place she dreamed of . The N.I.C.E . bosses now try to strengthen their hold over Mark by showing him trumped-up evidence that he murdered Bill Hingest . This backfires , as the crisis finally gives Mark the courage to leave Belbury . He returns to Edgestow in search of Jane only to find their apartment empty and the town under N.I.C.E . control . Later he meets Cecil Dimble , one of the St Anne \\'s community , who despite his misgivings offers to help him . Mark deliberates too long over Dimble \\'s proposal and he is found and arrested for Hingest \\'s murder . That night , during a heavy storm , both the company of St Anne \\'s and N.I.C.E . personnel are on the trail of Merlin , who has apparently revived . He has taken the clothes of a tramp through his powers of hypnosis and acquired a wild horse . He meets the company of St Anne \\'s but rides away . Members of the N.I.C.E . capture the tramp , believing him to be Merlin . Mark , while contemplating his upcoming trial and execution , discovers that he has not been arrested by the real police but by officials of the N.I.C.E . who ( he now guesses ) are the true murderers of Hingest . To his surprise he is told that he is to be initiated into the group \\'s inner ring . In preparation for this he begins a bizarre program of training intended to cultivate absolute objectivity by relegating emotion to the status of a chemical phenomenon . He outwardly participates in these rituals ( knowing that he will otherwise be killed ) but inwardly begins to reject everything the N.I.C.E . stands for . Merlin arrives at St Anne \\'s ahead of his pursuers , where he and Ransom converse in Latin . Ransom reveals that there are Satanic forces behind the N.I.C.E . and that Merlin is to be possessed by the Oyéresu ; since the forces of darkness broke the lunar barrier in the earlier books , the heavenly beings may also cross the barrier and intervene in human affairs . Jane has two mystical experiences ; the first with the earth-bound counterpart of the Oyarsa of Venus , and the second with God . After discussions with Mrs . Dimble and the Director , she becomes a Christian . Merlin , now possessed by the Oyéresu , disguises himself as a Basque priest and answers the N.I.C.E . \\'s advertisement for an interpreter of ancient languages . He hypnotises and interviews the tramp ( who the N.I.C.E . still believe may be the real Merlin ) and the two of them are brought to a banquet . There Merlin pronounces the curse of Babel upon the assembled N.I.C.E . leaders , causing all present to speak gibberish , and also liberates the many animals on which the N.I.C.E . were experimenting . The bigger animals kill most of the N.I.C.E . staff . As earthquakes destroy the building , Lord Feverstone flees to Edgestow but is killed when that too is engulfed . Merlin helps Mark escape and sends him to St Anne \\'s . The Oyarsa of Venus lingers at the Manor , as Ransom is now to be transported back to that planet . When Mark arrives , a vision of Venus leads him into a bridal chamber that Jane has been preparing for him . Setting and context The novel is set in post-war England , in the fictional English town of Edgestow , in approximately 1948 according to the internal timeline of \\'The Cosmic Trilogy \\' . The story takes place inside the University of Edgestow , within the nearby town , at the new N.I.C.E . headquarters and at St Anne \\'s Manor . Elwin Ransom , introduced in the novel in Chapter 7 , is the protagonist of the first two books in Lewis \\'s space trilogy , and his point of view dominates their narrative . Lord Feverstone ( formerly Dick Devine ) was a villain in the first novel who , along with Professor Weston , had abducted Ransom to Mars in the mistaken belief that the Martians required a sacrifice . When Feverstone speaks in That Hideous Strength of Weston having been murdered by \" the opposition \" , he is speaking of Ransom having killed Weston ( who had become possessed by a devil ) on Venus as described in Perelandra . The first two books fully explicate Lewis \\'s mythology ( based on a combination of the Bible and medieval astrology ) according to which each planet of the solar system is ruled by an angelic spirit . This mythos is re-introduced gradually in this story , whose protagonists -- the earthbound Mark and Jane Studdock -- are unaware of these realities when the story opens . Characters Mark Gainsby Studdock – Protagonist ; sociologist , and ambitious to the point of obsession with reaching the \" inner circle \" of his social environment .

Arthur Denniston – An academic at Edgestow and a former friend of Mark Studdock from student days . Camilla Denniston - The wife of Arthur Denniston . Themes and philosophy A significant element of the book ( Lewis rated it as \" second in importance \" ) is to illustrate the destructive folly of seeking power and prestige by belonging to a ruling clique or inner circle . Somewhat like the early Gnostics , the main antagonists of That Hideous Strength despise the human body and all organic life as frail , corrupted , and unworthy of pure mind . Like modern transhumanists , they believe that humanity can be perfected by migrating out of flesh and blood . Lewis portrays the consequences of these ideas as a dystopian nightmare : by rejecting God and His creation , the N.I.C.E inevitably falls under the dominion of demons ( whom they imagine to have discovered under the guise of \" macrobes \" ) . Lewis had hinted at such themes before in The Screwtape Letters , in which the senior demon Screwtape tells his nephew that their goal is \" to emotionalise and mythologise their science to such an extent that what is , in effect , a belief in [ demons ] ( though not under that name ) will creep in while the human mind remains closed to belief in [ God ] . [ ... ] If once we can produce our perfect work—the Materialist Magician , the man , not using , but veritably worshipping , what he vaguely calls \\'Forces \\' while denying the existence of \\'spirits\\'—then the end of the war will be in sight . \" Lewis \\'s attack is not on science as such , or scientific planning , but rather the kind of totalitarian planned society idealised by Nazism and Bolshevism : \" the disciplined cruelty of some ideological oligarchy . \" In contrast , Lewis portrays reality as supporting Christian tenets such as the inherent sinfulness of humanity , the impossibility of humans perfecting themselves apart from God , the essential goodness of the physical body ( though currently corrupted by sin ) , the omnipotence of God against the limited powers of evil , and the existence of angels and demons . Within this Christian framework , Lewis incorporates elements of the Arthurian legend as well as Roman mythological figures . In this way , Lewis integrates Christian , Roman , and British mythological symbolism , true to his identity as a British Christian student of antiquity . Development and influences Lewis started writing That Hideous Strength during World War II , finishing the first draft in 1943 . During the War , Lewis taught at Oxford University and among other writing projects worked on the last two books of his \" Space Trilogy \" –Perelandra ( 1943 ) and That Hideous Strength . The novel makes reference to \" Numinor and the True West \" , which Lewis credits as a then-unpublished creation of J . R . R . Tolkien ; they were friends and colleagues at Oxford University and fellow members of The Inklings . The misspelling of Númenor came from Lewis \\'s only hearing Tolkien say the name in one of his readings . Charles Williams \\'s treatments of the King Arthur legends were a significant influence on the Arthurian elements of the novel . Brenton D . G . Dickieson writes , \" Williams \\' idea of Logres emerges in That Hideous Strength , forming the speculative framework of a good-evil dialectic in the apocalyptic narrative of this last Ransom chronicle \" . In the book \\'s preface , Lewis acknowledges science-fiction writer Olaf Stapledon and his work : \" Mr . Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can well afford to lend , and I admire his invention ( though not his philosophy ) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow . \" Reception Some two years before writing Nineteen Eighty-Four , George Orwell reviewed That Hideous Strength for the Manchester Evening News , commenting : \" Plenty of people in our age do entertain the monstrous dreams of power that Mr Lewis attributes to his characters [ the N.I.C.E . scientists ] , and we are within sight of the time when such dreams will be realizable . \" The review was written shortly after the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . However , Orwell argued that the book \" would have been stronger without the supernatural elements \" . Particularly , Orwell objected to the ending in which N.I.C.E . is overthrown by divine intervention : \" [ Lewis ] is entitled to his beliefs , but they weaken his story , not only because they offend the average reader \\'s sense of probability but because in effect they decide the issue in advance . When one is told that God and the Devil are in conflict , one always knows which side is going to win . The whole drama of the struggle against evil lies in the fact that one does not have supernatural aid . \" However , Orwell still maintained that the book was \" worth reading \" . Leonard Bacon , reviewing That Hideous Strength , described the book as \" a ghastly but in many places a magnificent nightmare \" . He criticised the character of Studdock as uninteresting , noting that \" it is hard to get excited about the vagaries of a young , insecure and ambitious academic figure whose main concern is to get into an inner circle , any inner circle \" , but praised the plotting of the book : \" The hunt of Ransom \\'s remnant for the real Merlin while the villains capture the false one is as vivid as a passage in Stevenson . \" Although Bacon regarded the book as somewhat inferior to its two predecessors , he concluded : \" This is just the sort of thing that pleases Mr . Lewis \\'s admirers . And they are right to admire him . Win , lose or draw—and the reviewer does n\\'t think that this book is wholly victorious—Mr . Lewis adds energy to systems he comes in contact with . \" Floyd C . Gale wrote that the book \" bears the authentic stamp of its creator \\'s awesome imagination \" . J . B . S . Haldane published two essays attacking Lewis \\'s negative views on science and progress , as he saw them ; the first was entitled \" Auld Hornie , F.R.S . \" . Lewis \\'s response remained unpublished in his lifetime . Alister McGrath says the novel \" shows [ C . S . Lewis ] to have been a prophetic voice , offering a radical challenge to the accepted social wisdom of his own generation \" . Publication history Lewis made minor alterations between the first British and American editions . For example , some of the Latin is corrected , and a scene where Merlin hides in the hedgerow was removed by Lewis . 1945 ( December ) , UK , The Bodley Head , hardback ( first edition ) 1946 , US , Macmillan Publishing Co. , New York City 1946 Paperback edition , abridged by the author , published in the United States under the title The Tortured Planet by Macmillan and under its original title in Britain by PAN books 1996 , US , Scribner Classics 1996 ( 1 June ) , US , Simon & Schuster , paperback , 1996 ( 28 October ) , US , Simon & Schuster , hardback , 2012 ( April ) , US , HarperCollins , e-book , References External links Tower of Babel 1945 British novels Modern Arthurian fiction Christian science fiction The Space Trilogy books 1945 science fiction novels British science fiction novels Dystopian novels Sequel novels The Bodley Head books', 'Deities associated with death take many different forms , depending on the specific culture and religion being referenced . Psychopomps , deities of the underworld , and resurrection deities are commonly called death deities in religious texts . The term colloquially refers to deities that either collect or rule over the dead , rather than those deities who determine the time of death . However , all these types are included in this article . Many have incorporated a god of death into their mythology or religion . As death , along with birth , is among the major parts of human life , these deities may often be one of the most important deities of a religion . In some religions in which a single powerful deity is the object of worship , the death deity is an antagonist against whom the primary deity struggles . The related term death worship has most often been used as a derogatory term to accuse certain groups of morally abhorrent practices which set no value on human life . In monotheistic religions , death is commonly personified by an angel or demon instead of a deity . Occurrence In polytheistic religions which have a complex system of deities governing various natural phenomena and aspects of human life , it is common to have a deity who is assigned the function of presiding over death . This deity may actually take the life of humans or , more commonly , simply rule over the afterlife in that particular belief system ( a single religion may have separate deities performing both tasks ) . The deity in question may be good , evil , or neutral and simply doing their job , in sharp contrast to a lot of modern portrayals of death deities as all being inherently evil just because death is feared . Hades from Greek mythology is an especially common target . The inclusion of such a \" departmental \" deity of death in a religion \\'s pantheon is not necessarily the same thing as the glorification of death . A death deity has a good chance of being either male or female , unlike some functions that seem to steer towards one gender in particular , such as fertility and earth deities being female and storm deities being male . A single religion/mythology may have death gods of both genders existing at the same time and they may be envisioned as a married couple ruling over the afterlife together , as with the Aztecs , Greeks , and Romans . In monotheistic religions , the one god governs both life and death ( as well as everything else ) . However , in practice this manifests in different rituals and traditions and varies according to a number of factors including geography , politics , traditions , and the influence of other religions .

In the novel The Book Thief , Death is the narrator of the story . Death is the name of one of \" The Endless \" in the DC Universe . Death is a recurring character in the Discworld series written by Terry Pratchett . Books featuring Death include Mort , Reaper Man , Soul Music , Hogfather and Thief of Time . He also makes a cameo appearance in Interesting Times . In A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R . Martin , the guild of assassins known as the Faceless Men believe that all death deities are simply different incarnations of the same god , known to them as the Many-Faced God or Him of Many Faces , while the Faith of the Seven worships The Stranger as one of Seven Aspects of God representing Death and the Unknown . In the works of J . R . R . Tolkien , especially The Silmarillion , Nàmo AKA Lord Mandos is the Doomsman of the Valar , Judge of the Dead and Lord of the Halls of Mandos ( where Elves await reincarnation and humans retreat before making the Journey into the Beyond ) . In the CW TV show Supernatural , Death makes a crucial appearance . He is portrayed as existing alongside God since the beginning of time and being so ancient he can not remember when he came into existence ; he may even be older than God . In the show he is the oldest and most powerful of the Four Horsemen ( Death , Famine , War and Pestilence ) . He is not portrayed as a villain . In the Sailor Moon franchise , the last Sailor Guardian ( of the Sol System ) introduced is Sailor Saturn . Her powers revolve around destruction , ruin , and death and she can be thought of as a \" god \" of sorts ( all Sailor Guardians can ) . Her weapon is the Silence Glaive that is capable of utterly obliterating and destroying entire worlds/planets if used to its maximum potential . In the Marvel Comics Universe , the personification of death is Mistress Death . The Transformers mythos features the character of Mortilus , a Cybertronian deity who represents death and who later betrayed his brethren and was destroyed , leading to the longevity of the Transformer race . A similar character is The Fallen , a member of the Thirteen Primes who is identified as the guardian of entropy . In the manga and anime , Death Note , gods of death ( shinigami ) exist in their own realm and are owners of Death Notes , which are used to kill humans . When a note falls into the human world , the person who touches it first becomes the new owner of the note , can recognize the god of death to whom it belongs , and the god follows them for the rest of their life . However , shinigami are more like Grim Reapers with freakish appearances than deities who are worshiped . This is because shinigami are a fairly recent concept in Japanese folklore directly inspired by the European figure of the Grim Reaper , and thus , are n\\'t \" true \" death gods . Despite their Western origin , many people will refer to both the Death Note characters and the folklorical shinigami using the Japanese name instead of the English translation or even \" Grim Reaper \" . For similar cases of shinigami being more akin to Grim Reapers in anime , see Bleach ( anime ) and Soul Eater ( anime ) . In the first campaign of the roleplaying adventure podcast The Adventure Zone , the character Kravitz is a bounty hunter who apprehends people disrupting the natural order of life and death . He even remarks on being called the Grim Reaper by some societies . While Kravitz starts out as a minor antagonist in the story , he returns as an ally to the heroes . Kravitz is gay and the romantic love interest of Taako , one of the main protagonists . In the 2018 Nintendo published title Kirby Star Allies a Butterfly is revealed to be the embodiment of death , ruling the underworld after atomizing and absorbing Galacta Knight to become Morpho Knight . Very little is known about it but it is awaiting something called the Day of Judgement . In Nintendo \\'s Metroid franchise one of the bosses , Ridley , is also known as \" the Cunning God of Death \" .
